00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.320
Ms. Zhao.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.230
Nice view here.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.880
The weather's great too.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.600
Everything looks crystal clear.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.000
I doubt that.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.110
Ms. Zhao, your guys aren't doing their job.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.600
You must be working hard.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560
So, Mr. Zhuang, sounds like

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.040
you didn't

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.350
exactly enjoy working

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.200
with Dingchuan?

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.220
(Wanted Notice)

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.430
Why not turn this trash

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.840
to our advantage

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.230
and wrap up Hu Bo's case?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.840
Also,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.430
you should cut ties with Mr. Mai ASAP.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.920
With Zhao Xueli dead,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.790
he'll speed up his exit.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.120
A man like that doesn't deserve you.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.560
It's not about deserving,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.790
only wanting.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.350
You're backing Ding Chuan?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.960
You're right.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.710
I've been wearing

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.230
this bracelet for too long.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.280
Mr. Zhuang, please help me

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.920
get rid of it.

See you at Wanxiang Garden at noon.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.590
Mr. Xu,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.670
I'm sorry.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.750
Why are you apologizing?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.160
It's not your fault.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.270
Sit down.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.830
Maybe staying off

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.670
this case

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.520
is safer for you now.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.270
Right, Xu Jingzhi?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.870
It's not your fault.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.070
What's their signature dish?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.520
Steamed bass.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.080
Are you hungry?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.310
Liu Wanyao may not be dead.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.160
Legally speaking,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.160
without a body,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.560
you can't call it a death.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.600
The golden window in kidnapping cases

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800
is 48 hours.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.360
It's been half a month

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.430
since she disappeared.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.160
With that much blood loss,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.830
she couldn't survive without treatment.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.160
We've already sent...

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.190
We've sent people

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.240
to watch hospitals

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.190
and clinics.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.870
The kidnapping might be fake.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.480
So you still insist

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.190
the victim is the murderer?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.440
We did

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.830
this case together.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.070
Did we miss something?

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.240
You missed

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.480
Xu Jingzhi's wild fantasy.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.520
Exactly.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.800
Wild fantasy.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.660
(Resident ID of Wang Sixi)
I've done all I can.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.630
Whether you can escape

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.950
depends on youself.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.720
Cut the crap about being nice.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.630
I've been exposed.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.670
You did it, didn't you?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.310
Don't blame the innocent.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.310
If you were innocent...

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.390
Hello,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.950
your signature crab-roe dumplings.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.760
Please enjoy.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.510
Come on,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.350
dig in.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.600
This is your last meal

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.870
as Ding Chuan.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.360
Go on.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.120
You're not a cop now.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.160
Say whatever you want.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.750
The death scene of Liu Wanyao

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.590
at Hu Bo's place

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.840
was staged.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.670
That's my suspect.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.680
What about the bloody hand print
on the table leg

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.920
and the lethal amount

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.040
of blood in the carpet?

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.360
Those were just to mislead you.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.160
Even if he wanted to mislead us,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.120
why clean the scene

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.270
so thoroughly?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.950
It's amazing.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.630
It was cleaned almost to

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.480
the point of being invisible.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.560
Maybe the cleaner

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.070
has anticoagulants in it.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.040
That's nonsense.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.270
That's used to preserve blood.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.270
Anticoagulants are easy to detect,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.510
but the ingredients in carpet cleaner

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.190
can neutralize them,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.310
leaving DNA and blood type

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.680
intact for identification.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.750
The blood left in the carpet

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.120
can be used to estimate blood loss.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.150
Xu Jingzhi,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.000
a fingertip glucose test

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.760
gives enough blood.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.600
And he wasn't worried

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.550
we'd focus on Wu Xinxin

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.440
in the freezer

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.750
and miss

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.910
the staged scene?

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.150
It's not that he trusted us.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.240
He knew we'd take the bait.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.320
Even if we found no blood

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.510
at the scene,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.440
we'd keep digging into Wu Xinxin,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.240
then eventually find out Hu Bo was dead.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.790
The code on the bones

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.080
would lead us to Liu Wanyao.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.200
When we hit

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.120
a dead end

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.550
and came back to the scene,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.390
we'd find

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.000
Liu Wanyao already dead.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.710
That's right.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.510
Logically, it all lines up.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.110
Technically,

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.390
it's not hard.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.870
But the hard part is that

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.960
he'd have to know

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.480
our entire investigation process,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.360
and

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.200
every step would need

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.840
to hit our blind spots.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.670
That's harder than killing Hu Bo.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.600
Could Liu Wanyao do that?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.440
That's why this is Xu Jingzhi's

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.320
wild fantasy.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.480
We can't prove the blood

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.600
at the scene wasn't fresh,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.390
and we can't find Liu Wanyao

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.600
to confirm any of it.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.670
But what if

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.080
someone as smart as him

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.630
planned everything?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.960
Me?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.840
Yeah, I did it.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.240
Honestly, it could've been you.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.550
You planned all of this first,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.910
forced Zhao Xueli to his death,

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.080
filmed it through someone, posted it online,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.630
and got yourself fired.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.630
That would be easy.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.630
Geniuses like him are rare

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.840
and easy to spot.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.440
But why would he

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.630
do it?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.390
Don't forget we're the police.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.360
Everything we do must be based on

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.680
facts and evidence.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.680
What do you mean?

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.840
Does it matter?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.270
Why are you snapping at me?

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.360
The one who wants you dead is your boss,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.440
not me.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.350
How about this?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.000
Hire me.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.630
I'll kill her for you.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.750
I'll give you a friend discount.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.480
You don't dare.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.320
The neighbors are all old acquaintances.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.790
Anything happening in there?

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.320
Don't drink if you can't handle it.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.510
Get up, man!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.390
Who says I can't drink?

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.990
Let go of me!

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.940
(Room 3, Room 2)

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.840
So, you're still defending your boss

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.550
after everything, huh?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:52.870
I'll kill you!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.150
Not answering your phone?

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.440
Hello?

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.510
You're free now.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.920
Don't move.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.750
Give me the money.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.750
Money.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.670
It's your first time doing this, right?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.750
Ma'am, listen to me.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.750
I don't want to hurt you.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.600
I... I just need money for food.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.870
I'm sorry.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.480

You're welcome.

Can you give this drawing to me?

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.000
She reacts this way

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.960
whenever she sees a man.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.150
So, the doctor doesn't recommend

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.480
that your sister leave the nursery.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.440
She'd be worse off

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.550
if she went back into society.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.150
But what if she's with someone she trusts most?

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.960
That might help.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.110
But since she acts this way,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.760
