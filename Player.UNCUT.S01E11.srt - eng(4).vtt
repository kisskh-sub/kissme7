- (Previously on "Player")
- You have to pay Pun back

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.440
on the exact day and time I tell you.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.760
Why do you have to make this so complicated?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.560
You’ve never been like this before.
Do you realize that?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.640
So why?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.360
Why have you let the whole thing
with Pun drag on this long?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.880
I feel like I’m on the outside.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.960
I’m sorry, Jay.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.320
For not giving you enough attention before.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.120
We almost didn’t make it here.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.400
The two people who deserve love
the most right now

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.880
are you and Pun.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960
I really want both of you to be happy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.720
Oh, Pun!

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.600
Perfect timing.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.160
Dinner’s just ready.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.160
I was just about to call you.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.400
These are all delicious.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360
Oh, I forgot to mention.
Today we have…

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.560
I need to call her…

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.040
as our honorary chef today.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.320
I don’t know if you have other guests.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.160
Excuse me, then.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.520
Wait, wait. She’s not a guest.
No need to go. Just sit.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.080
Let me introduce you two officially.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.759
Come on. Sit here.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.080
Let me introduce her officially.
This is Ploy.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.560
My sister.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Well, actually…

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.920
You can call her a sister-in-law.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.400
Looks like you guys know
each other already, right?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.120
If it’s in a relative introduction,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.120
we just met each other today.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.880
Well…

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.680
(Phone ringing)

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.840
Oh!

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.920
I’ve got an urgent meeting.
Excuse me.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.000
An orange juice for you.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.640
If it’s not enough, I’ve got more.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.520
You don’t like orange juice anymore?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.240
I haven’t had orange juice in a while.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:27.800
Pun.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.079
I’m sorry.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
Just leave.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.800
Pun. I…

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.840
Get out!

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.040
I’m done

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.160
with this kind of hurt.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.079
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.760
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.280
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.159
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.480
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.640
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.640
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.240
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.920
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.040
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.360
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.640
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.120
♫ Game Over ♫

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.880
Alright, guys!

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.720
Let’s all eat!

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.680
Everything looks so delicious.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.480
Ploy, can you get me some rice?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.159
Phe, would you like orange juice?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.000
Giving away my orange juice like that,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.000
You really put me on blast.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.640
Please mind your manners.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.720
I’m about to be your sister-in-law.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.240
Show some respect.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.320
Deep down, is that what you really want?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.360
Phe, I’m not hungry. So excuse me.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.720
Please sit down.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.440
Ploy…

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.240
Well, Ploy…

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.680
You just finished cooking.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.480
I want this meal to be an official family dinner.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.800
Ploy, please don’t go.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I’m thinking that

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.520
I don’t want to interrupt your family time.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.040
Ploy…

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.159
You didn’t eat anything yet.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.880
If you don’t have dinner here,
where would you go?

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.600
Phe.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.640
I could take care of myself.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.000
I’m leaving, then.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.240
What do you want from me?

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.960
Are you going to work now?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.720
May I walk you?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.200
♫ You’re my Love Game
Only you can make me feel the same ♫

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.200
♫ Don’t you know my heart’s gone wild inside? ♫

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.840
♫ All I want is you here by my side ♫

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.680
♫ Forever, is that fine? ♫

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.720
♫ Cuz you’re my Love Game ♫

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.240
Why?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.640
Am I not pretty?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.200
So gorgeous, actually.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.480
So are you.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.520
I…

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.600
I really want to thank you, Prang.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.520
For being at my side all along.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.520
We’ve been through a lot.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.960
I love you so much.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.880
So do I, Jay.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.040
Why are you home so late today?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.160
Come on. Let’s have a meal.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.360
Ploy just cooked for us.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.440
Phe.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.840
Huh?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.880
I may not join you.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.280
Not today,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.000
tomorrow, or any others.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.320
You don’t have to wait for me

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.680
because I’m so busy,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.200
or I might be at the party,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.000
or I’ve already eaten out.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.120
What about today?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.680
I’m not hungry.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.520
"Damn. This is such a sitcom moment."

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.600
"Why did my stomach have to growl now?"

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.600
Please sit down.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.040
I’m heading back.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.880
Today, I won't stop you.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.120
I really can’t stop you
from leaving everyday, you know?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.120
Mm.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.920
See you soon.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.920
"Another day that I can’t enjoy my meal."

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.280
What?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.360
I’m not hungry.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.280
Oh.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.560
Good to hear. I eat them all.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.680
Wow. Omelette’s so appetizing.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.440
Oh! Orange juice.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.360
Oh my goodness!

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040
It’s so refreshing.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.240
I’m not hungry!

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.160
Up to you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.440
I’ll eat them all.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.160
(Phone ringing)

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.240
Hello?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.240
Hey, Pun!

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.920
I think I need you to send me
your artwork description.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.120
For university guidance in Thailand, right?

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.040
Yes.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.920
Could you send me tonight?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.600
We're in a bit of a hurry.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.760
Okay.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.960
So…

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.040
Are you sure you cannot go?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.800
I need more time to think.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.320
Yeah. You think about it.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.760
Yeah. Sure.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.920
Bye.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.600
I think we did a really amazing job there.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.560
Yes, I totally agree.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.200
- I’m so happy about the final product.
- Yeah.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.240
Pun?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.400
Umm… is that your friend?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.160
You should introduce us.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.040
It doesn’t matter.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.680
We aren’t even close or anything.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.320
Hi.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.560
I’m Ploy.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.960
Nice to meet you.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.720
Umm…

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.840
I think we have to go get some dinner.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.600
Umm…

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.520
Yeah.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.280
Are you tired?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.080
Umm…

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.720
What are you doing here, Ploy?

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.600
I came to see you.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.680
I have to go somewhere else.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.240
Don’t follow me.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.960
Go to your plans.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
I don’t mind.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.400
Can you stop bothering me already?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.880
You aren’t seeing anyone, right?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.000
Do I have a chance?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.640
What if I said I do?

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.400
Would you be okay?

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.080
I’m gonna check to be sure first.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.080
Even if there’s only one percent left
of what you still feel for me,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160
I won’t let go.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.960
For what?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.440
I really want to ask you.
What is this even for?

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.520
Do you have any idea...

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.680
what it took for me to get through everything?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.160
How hard I tried
just to forget what we had.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.480
So damn hard.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.480
It’s all been good recently.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.319
Why do you have to come back?

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.600
I’m sorry.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.720
How many times do I have to tell you

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.800
that I’m scared?

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.000
I’m really scared.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.400
I don’t want to get hurt anymore.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.400
So damn scared.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.880
We’re even, aren’t we?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.640
I used you,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.440
and you toyed with my feelings.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.200
What we had was just like that.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.280
It was never real from the start.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.640
You said so yourself.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.720
So stop messing with me.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.600
Get out.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.640
- I...
- What?

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.560
What now?

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.000
Get out!

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.120
You’re not leaving, right?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.360
I’ll go instead.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.560
Hello?

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.320
What’s up, Pun?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.120
Yes,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.040
I made up my mind.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.760
Hi. Welcome.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.040
Phetai.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.920
Where’s Pun?

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.000
She left.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.320
I’m sorry.
I found out this morning.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.840
And where are you heading to?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.680
I’ll take you to see Pun.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.920
I can go by myself.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.600
Don’t you need to
look after your restaurant?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.440
Ploy. I have someone taking care of it.
No need to worry.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920
Well, Ploy...

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.680
I don’t know if I’ve ever said this but...

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.000
I’m sorry, Ploy.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.840
I’m sorry that

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.840
everything turned out this way.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.640
All of sudden, you act like this.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.800
It’s a bit unsettling.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.480
So I’m leaving now.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.040
Do I really have to run away again?

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.880
Did you just wake up,
or have you been up all night?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.560
Huh?

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.720
What’s wrong, Prang?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.160
I’m sorry, Jay.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.160
I can’t stop thinking of Pun.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.120
Then what about this?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920
Let’s go see her.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.720
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.280
Fly to New York.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.560
So you can make up with her.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Thank you.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720
It’s okay.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.200
You should hurry up
and make up with Pun.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.560
If not, we’ll lose one wedding envelope.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.480
How cute.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.360
It’s because I love you.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.000
Love you so, so much.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.960
I love you too.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.680
Really?

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.160
Ahem.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.760
Don't tease me.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.240
What?

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.560
Why?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.840
Playing hard to get.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.320
We haven’t even had our wedding night yet.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.120
We’re already way past that.
Why are you still playing hard to get?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800
Thank you.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.480
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.440
I made a reservation
under the name ‘Punnakorn’.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.760
I reserved the room for a week.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.720
Just a moment, please.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.480
Sure.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.400
Miss Punnakorn, right?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.040
You’re in room 4202, on the 42nd floor.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.280
The 42nd floor?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.600
Yes.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.280
(”The Deviana”)

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.240
Did you check everything thoroughly?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.440
If you forget anything,
I’m not going back to get it.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.560
Please, Prang.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.000
I’ve checked a million times.
We didn’t forget anything.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.120
We can stay there for a month.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.480
- Ploy!
- Ploy!

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720
How’s everything?
Why are you back so early?

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.200
Have you already given up?

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.720
Where are you guys heading to?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.240
Well...

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.480
We’re going to New York.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.760
I’ll take Prang to make up with Pun.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.400
What? Pun’s in Thailand?

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.080
Since when, Ploy?

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.000
Two days ago.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.680
But I don’t know where she’s stayed.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.600
If I do, I’ll tell you.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.920
Darn it.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.520
I already booked the tickets, you know.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.160
I’m sorry, Jay…

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.760
but

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.600
can we postpone the flight to America first?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.560
Please?

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040
Are you okay with that, Jay?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.560
I’m fine, Prang.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.880
We were going to America to see Pun, right?

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.440
So if she’s here,

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.400
we don’t need to go.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.480
Thank you.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.240
But honestly, I’m still disappointed.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.200
I planned everything so carefully.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.920
That Pun…

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.480
If I see her,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.960
she’ll be in trouble.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.440
So why did Pun come back to Thailand?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.680
I heard from Phe that

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.520
Pun came back to help her professor
at the art gallery.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.760
And you will…

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.120
I’m going now.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.200
How far are you planning to follow me?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.520
Is this one of your New York pieces?

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.160
This has nothing to do with you.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200
I like it, though.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.760
It’s like a butterfly

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.320
that a flower always misses.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.320
Ploy, please. That’s enough.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400
I’m begging you.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280
Do you have any idea

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.800
what I had to go through to get here?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.840
Do you know how broken I was?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.240
Everything

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.080
was finally going well.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.000
And then you just decide to come back.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.000
What about my feelings?

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.720
If you’re playing with my feelings,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.360
please stop.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.680
I don’t want to be confused anymore.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.960
Please. Just stop.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.600
I think about you every single day.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.200
Enough, Ploy.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.920
But I couldn't heal myself
the way you healed yourself.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.080
I want you to think about yourself

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.360
for one week from now.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.840
If you still feel anything for me,

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.520
meet me here, in front of this picture.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.640
You don’t have to decide right away.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.600
I’ll be right here waiting.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.320
I’m not going anywhere.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.160
(One week later)

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.480
As an alumna
and as the creator of the pieces,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.280
I want to say that aiming for high scores
is a good thing.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.760
But I’d like to add that

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.440
building your portfolio

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.400
and gaining experience little by little
are just as important.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.600
Thank you so much.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.000
Alright.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.560
And if anyone wants to know more

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.040
all the details are on our flyer,

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.520
most importantly,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.120
including the university’s contact information.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.920
If you want more information,
you can also follow the uni page.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.800
Please let me show you the next section.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.560
This piece

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.679
is the main work I wanted to showcase today.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.000
It’s beautiful.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.480
Where did you get the inspiration for it?

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.040
(Knocking on door)

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.280
(Knocking on door)

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.080
Phe?

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.040
You’re wondering how I knew you were here, right?

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.160
Your professor told me.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.560
Alright, fine.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.640
Why are you here?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.120
Just to say hi.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.240
I stopped by to see your work.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.760
You’re pretty good, you know.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.640
Ploy told you to come, didn’t she?

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.600
What?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.280
No. I came on my own.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.280
But yeah,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.880
I do want the two of you to talk.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.040
Go back, Phe.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.640
You’re supposed to meet
each other today, aren’t you?

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.480
She told you about that?

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.800
We talk, sometimes.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.320
It’s just…

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.160
I don’t want to get hurt anymore.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.240
Then

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.800
listen to my side for a moment.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.000
You know I’m broke, right?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.800
Yeah, of course.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.680
You’re in huge debt.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.040
You couldn’t pay the mafia,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.800
so you had to run back to Thailand.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.160
Okay.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.000
Have you ever wondered
where I got the money to fix the house?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.760
Let’s Eat Thai?

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.880
Okay.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.360
Well…

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.200
You’ve seen it, right?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.560
How I live every day

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.760
always running away.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.960
And you never wondered

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.520
where I got the money to pay you back?

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.040
That one million?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.640
Wait, Phe. You mean…

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.720
Mm. Ploy was angry.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.400
Really angry.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.280
She thought

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.120
you were using her at first.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.600
So she

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.960
gave me that million to pass it on to you.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.200
To test whether

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.040
you’d choose her or the money.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.080
Hold on.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.080
This was Ploy’s plan?

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.960
Yeah. You could call it a plan.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.400
But honestly, I think she was confused.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.680
See?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.000
In the end,

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.000
we were just lying each other.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.920
Both of you were wrong.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.000
You both had your reasons.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.120
But I want you to think carefully

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.640
why Ploy did what she did.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.080
If there’s anyone who knows her best,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.640
it’s you, isn’t it?

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.360
Let me speak as the bad older brother here.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.120
Ploy’s been through so much.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.280
And many times, I couldn’t help her.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.320
But after you came into her life,
I felt like....

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.120
she changed.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.960
She’s never done anything like this
for anyone before, Pun.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120
(door bell ringing)

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.040
Prang?

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.240
Pun.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.680
I’m sorry.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.320
Why are you apologizing?

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.040
I should be the one saying sorry.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.640
Sorry that I never knew anything.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.640
Well…

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.720
The reason I never said anything

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.280
was because I was scared
I’d disappoint everyone.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.040
Pun...

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.560
Dad, Mom, and I

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.680
never expected anything from you.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.360
Exactly.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.040
Why is it that no one ever
expects anything from me?

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.360
Huh?

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.200
I still remember

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.280
the first time we watched you on TV with our parents.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.840
- Here she comes.
- "Chai Klang.”

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.640
“Chai Noi.”

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.960
- Why is our daughter so beautiful? Right?
- "And when we finally got to see you,"

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.080
"Dad and Mom were so happy."

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.040
"Dad laughed, and Mom smiled along with him."

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.640
"The look on their faces showed
how proud they were of you, Prang."

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.880
"I just wish they could be"

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.680
"proud of me like that, even once.”

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.840
The way they looked at you…

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.880
They were so proud of you.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.800
That look

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.280
is something I’ve never gotten.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.160
You wouldn’t understand

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.840
what it's like to feel unimportant.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.680
I’ve always felt like

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.640
I’m stuck in the middle.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.400
Worthless.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.160
No one is proud of me.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.600
Listen to me, Pun.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.400
I know I can’t tell you not to feel that way.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.240
But I want you to know.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.120
That place you keep saying

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.200
you’re stuck in the middle,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.920
I’m there with you.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.840
Dad and Mom are there with you too.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.400
I’ve always been proud of you, Pun.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.120
And your sister-in-law
is also very proud of you, my little sister.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.680
Ploy!

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.800
Hurry up. She’s waiting for you.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.640
- Phe!
- Whoa!

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.920
Why are you yelling? I’m here.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.120
About Ploy,
is there anything else you haven’t told me?

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.720
I don’t know. Go ask her yourself.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.560
What?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.640
Okay. Fine.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.440
Remember what I said

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.400
about the house repairs?

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.440
Mm.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040
Ploy paid for it.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.600
And...

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.120
she told me to pick you up and
drop you off every day.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.120
She was scared you might still be in danger.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.760
And...

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.960
the rent you haven’t been paying,

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.840
Ploy covered that too.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.160
Why are you only telling me this now?

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.720
- Hold on tight.
- Yes.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.600
Darn it.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.600
Here, take a hundred.
Keep the change.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.640
Thank you.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.480
The event is closed now.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.720
Then why are you still here?

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.440
I was just hoping

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.600
in case someone came late.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:29.840
Are you testing me again?

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.760
Is this fun for you?

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.720
I’m sorry.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.840
I know I was wrong.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.280
But if you knew that, why didn’t you talk to me?

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.560
Do you know how much it hurts, Ploy…

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.240
feeling like I was lying to you all the time?

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.480
And do you know how scared I was?

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.160
Scared that if you ever found out the truth,

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.240
I’d lose you.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.720
It was unbearable.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.160
I’m really sorry.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.640
I’m sorry too.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.960
You can trust me, Ploy.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.240
I do trust you.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.440
I do trust you too, Ploy.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.200
Thank you.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.800
Thank you, too.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.120
- (Next episode)
- What the hell is going on, Phe?

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:12.960
What happened?

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.080
Everything’s going to be okay.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.400
You’re going to be alright, Pun.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.120
I promise.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.080
Ploy...

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.560
Don’t let go, okay?

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.040
My butterfly.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:20.960
Ploy!

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.040
After facing danger,

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.840
and seeing a friend die in front of me,

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.080
I realized how unpredictable life is.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.600
I don’t want to waste even a single second.
