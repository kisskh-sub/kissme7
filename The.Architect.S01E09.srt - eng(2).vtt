You lowly maid.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.160
Let go of Yu!

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.560
You've seen it yourself.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.039
It was the Governor who held me.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720
As a concubine,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.960
how dare I struggle?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.559
Moreover,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.160
serving the Governor

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.079
is my duty.

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:23.446
You...

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.679

Pei Yu.

Wake up.

Wake up.

You brought this on yourself.

Don't regret it.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.319
Your Lordship, control yourself.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.040
I just wanted to check your safety.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.980
Luckily, it's just incense and wine,

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.360
not deadly poison.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.959
Otherwise, Miss Xi Yan would
be more worried.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.000
She's not truly worried.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.959
She's not a weak woman.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.079
She deliberately lowers herself
in front of me,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.480
but she has her own intentions.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.439
Then she's deceiving you, Your Lordship.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.839
She seeks protection.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.000
She found me.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.879
I'm happy.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.930
She can put effort into deceiving me,
rather than other men,

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.000
that's enough.

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.000
You

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.399
quickly go arrange the prison.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.839
She stole my Qilin Token.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.100
She must have gone to find Li Gang.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.879
Since you intend

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.519
to let Miss Xi Yan go,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.390
why not directly have me
take her to the imperial prison?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.439
Dozens of lives from the Shen family

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.879
are like dozens of shackles

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.879
pressing on her.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.439
Unless she personally unties them,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.000
otherwise her whole life

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.920
will not be at peace.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:54.920
Save me.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.519
No matter who you are,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.560
please save me.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.399
I was wronged.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.959
I was wronged.

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.279
I can save you.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.839
Tell me.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.240
Who bribed you

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.680
and framed the Shen family?

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.000
That person is...

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.360
If you want to know who it is,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.879
it'll cost more.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.279
Do you have money?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.920
Look.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.959
What is that?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.439
Who is the mysterious person?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.160
Even if you know, it's useless.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.439
You can't even touch
a single hair of theirs.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.759
You think if you stay silent,
the mysterious person will spare you.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:47.240
I tell you.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.759
Your wife and daughter are already dead.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:54.399
Their bodies exposed on the streets,
no burial place.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:05.920
No.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.279
Impossible.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.920
Your poor daughter

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.079
born mute.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.040
When tortured to death,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.839
she couldn't even cry out in pain.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.160
Dead?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.519
All dead?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.800
Then these are all mine alone.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.912
Your wife and daughter,
your closest blood,

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.559
and Master Shen's favor

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.080
can't compare to this gold and jewels.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.759
How do you know Master Shen
valued me so highly?

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.399
You...

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.600
Who exactly are you?

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.639
Tell me.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.440
Who are you?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.639
If it's not my father,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.919
how could you free yourself
from being a slave?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.080
How could you become
the Shen family steward?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:49.879
It's you.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.360
You are Shen Changning.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720
You are Shen Changning.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.000
Repaying kindness with hatred,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.240
aren't you afraid my father

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.879
would come back for your life?

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.759
Just because his family is wealthy,
does that mean I can only be a servant?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.720
I will never be a servant again.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.919
But he's dead.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:10.320
Dead by my hand.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.399
What did you say?

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.000
The mysterious person ordered me

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.200
to kill them before Pei Yu
arrived at the prison to silence them.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.000
What richest man of Daliang,
and wealthiest man in the world?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.559
His blood is still red,

00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:22.960
his brains still white.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.600
So it really wasn't Pei Yu.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:26.840
But his life

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.960
is truly valuable.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.559
Killing him earns so much money.

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.000
So much money.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.960
You killed my entire family!

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.360
Impossible.

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:45.879
Impossible.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.320
My gold...

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.720
Where's my gold?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.960
Is being young mistress so great?

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.120
Is having money so great?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.759
I will make you all die.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.900
You murdered your master
and defied heaven.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.840
For wealth, you acted like a beast.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.480
You tortured Lian like an animal.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:11.399
Even the eighteen layers of hell
cannot hold a degenerate like you.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.120
Let you die a thousand times,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.399
ten thousand times,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.840
still wouldn't be enough to atone.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.399
Tell me,

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:21.200
who is the mysterious person?

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:24.799
Tell me!

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:26.679
Stop!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.799
I really don't know who he is!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.120
I've never

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.720
seen his face.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:33.559
I only saw

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.480
his hand wearing a red and green ring.

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:50.879
I'm rich now!

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.200
I've made a fortune!

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.519
So much gold.

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:56.679
Gold.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:00.440
Do you rich people think
you're so great?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.759
Yet you still die by my blade.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.879
I'll never be a servant again.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.960
Let's see who dares command me now.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.840
I'll never be a servant again.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.159
Eat it.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.879
Eat it.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.000
Then no one

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.425
can ever take it away.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:28.679
(Dad.)

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.990
(Li Gang who betrayed the Shen family)

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.000
(and killed you is dead.)

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:35.600
(Died by his own inner demons.)

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
(Maybe I)

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.639
(will also be devoured
by my vengeful inner demons,)

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.639
(but I will never regret it.)

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.320
Who are you paying tribute to?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.660
Why would you come here
at midnight, Your Lordship?

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.080
Just a few old friends I've known
for years.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.240
They had no names when alive.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:10.159
So...

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.159
Just now, someone died
in the governor's prison.

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:23.159
The manner of death was strange.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:24.960
Died swallowing stones.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.120
(Li Gang died in the governor's prison.)

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:31.000
((This matter cannot be hidden.)

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.100
(Rather than waiting for him
to find evidence,)

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.639
(I should take the initiative
and admit it.)

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.320
I secretly borrowed the Qilin Token,

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:46.425
sneaked into the prison
and forced Li Gang to commit suicide.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.840
Li Gang made Lian's life
worse than death,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.399
I really couldn't stand by.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.159
If there was any offense,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.759
I'm willingly accepts punishment.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.240
Stealing the Qilin Token,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.159
punishing a prisoner
without authorization,

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.480
do you realize
what a grave crime it is?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.240
Does it hurt?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.720
Should I bandage your wound,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.200
or will you bathe me?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.919
You choose.

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.562
(Eternal Joy)

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.879
(Looking this closely,)

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.679
(I can see some sincerity
and gentleness in him.)

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:42.600
You should still pay attention
to your wound, or it may scar.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.850
I've broken the rules
of the Governor's Residence,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720
yet you don't punish me.

00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:49.750
Instead, you apply medicine for me.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.759
How do you know I'm applying medicine

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.799
and not trying to kill you?

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.960
The medicine is not poisoned.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.120
I personally applied it for you.

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.440
You should repay me somehow.

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:14.350
I won't make it difficult for you.

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.200
You just bathe me.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.679
Just now, you said

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:20.799
I could choose one.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.240
A dignified governor

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.919
actually breaks his word.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.840
I never claimed

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.550
to be a good person.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.600
Even if you're not good,

00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:36.048
you still have a pair of eyes, right?

00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:37.650
My hand is injured.

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:39.037
How could I bathe you?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.879
Exactly.

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:44.039
Then,

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.125
let's skip that.

00:15:47.075 --> 00:15:48.115
Go straight to the bed.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.390
Your Lordship, have some restraint.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.679
Xi Yan.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.830
You are already my honored concubine.

00:16:04.425 --> 00:16:06.412
(End of Episode)

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.320
If you want to kill

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.679
someone stronger than you,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.279
then strike

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.080
right here.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.080
Cut off her hand.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:21.960
Tonight, my goal is to have her jade arm
beneath a thousand pillows.

00:16:22.462 --> 00:16:24.622
And her crimson lips tasted
by ten thousand.
