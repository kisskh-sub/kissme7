00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.880
Shen Changning?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.520
Do you know what it feels like
when poison wine is swallowed?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.079
Do you know the pain

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.040
of drowning while burdened
with heavy stones?

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.400
Do you know the despair
of being betrayed and murdered

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.760
on your wedding night?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.079
Xiao,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.719
the dagger used for murder

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.319
must be carefully guarded.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.439
It must absolutely not fall into
the hands of others.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.799
Yan's reminder is timely.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.599
If we succeed,

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.879
I will happily marry
into the Prince Duan's Residence.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.760
If we fail,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.719
I shall use my own fresh blood
to make a sacrifice to this blade.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.280
How could I bear to use you
as a sacrifice?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.290
Though I do not possess
the overwhelming power of Pei Yu,

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.760
as long as I live for a day,

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.919
I will protect you completely.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.159
Xiao, don't rush.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.439
Listen to the Emperor first.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.560
Rest and recover more at the residence.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.599
On the day you leave the residence,

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.000
I will surely give you a surprise.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.680
Alright.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.675
(The Governor's Residence)

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.400
This Xiao Huaijin, pretends
to be unambitious in front of outsiders,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
but he is actually viciously scheming,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.390
and has always coveted
Your Lordship Governor's position.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.159
His methods are crude
and not worth worrying about.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.550
Then what is Your Lordship
concerned about?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.479
The person behind Xiao Huaijin.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:05.800
Who could that be?

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.759
Who it is is not important.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.240
What is important is
what he is plotting.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.919
Should we make arrangements in advance?

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.039
The entire Imperial City

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.560
is fully under the control
of the Qilin Guards.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120
This fire

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.680
should be allowed
to burn hotter and brighter.

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:43.850
(Consort Shu, Pei Shu)

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.560
Yu.

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.319
Greetings Your Lordship.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.319
Consort Shu is a noble person.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.190
How can you be troubled
with such trivial matters?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.490
Please forgive me, Your Lordship.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.719
These were all instructed by the Empress.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.759
They need to be done
before the Emperor's birthday banquet.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.680
The Emperor also said
that Consort is meticulous,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.840
and only when such important matters

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.590
are entrusted to Consort
can he feel relieved.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.680
It's fine.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.360
I am idle anyway.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.300
The Empress is making things
difficult for you again?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.040
I can handle it.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.879
I heard that Young Lord Xiao brought troops
to search the Governor's Residence.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.680
Her Majesty
and Young Lord Xiao are cousins.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:38.759
Could it be...

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.560
Xiao Huaijin

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.000
cannot stir up any waves.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.800
We have relied on
each other since childhood,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.120
and only I know

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.190
how you crawled out of a pile
of dead bodies,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.990
and reached where you are today,
step by step.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.079
Although

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:54.839
I am by the Emperor's side,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.639
I cannot help you much.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.319
I even implicate you,

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.879
making you suffer the schemes
of the Imperial Court.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.240
You know.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.240
Fame and fortune

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.040
are just fleeting clouds to me.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.959
I only asks that you be safe.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.160
Dare to move again?

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.279
Adding green vitriol to the water...

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.920
Are you trying
to turn me into a cripple?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.120
That's a vicious move.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:06.759
How about

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.439
you try the taste
of this green vitriol for me first?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.920
Do you know who I am?

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.240
Stop!

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:17.350
I am the matron of the Madam
of the Governor's Residence!

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.600
Release your hand immediately!

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.800
Madam?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.279
The Princess was granted marriage
by the Emperor,

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.570
and is the officially appointed Madam
of the Governor's Residence!

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.860
Precisely because you are the Madam,

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.860
you should not indulge
your servant in evil deeds.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.720
Once I confirm the danger
of this green vitriol,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.279
I will ask the Governor

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.279
to personally come and seek justice.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.439
What do you want?

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.240
Your Highness,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.079
Then I will trouble Matron Li

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.519
to personally move my belongings,

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.959
as atonement for her mistake.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.360
You...

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.590
Then I shall return to my room and wait.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.240
Your Highness, this...

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.360
Xi Yan might not be simple.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:11.000
She previously escaped
with her life from Xiao Huaijin,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.400
and now,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
she has narrowly escaped from Li Wan'er.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.199
Watch the show.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.439
Hurry up and clean this place.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.880
Don't let the Governor find out.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.070
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.470
Everything has been arranged properly.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.519
Even if she returns to the backyard,

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.040
she will just be rushing to her death.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.240
Where is she?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.439
Where did she go?

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.399
She was just here.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.120
Go.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.839
Let's go look.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.320
The laws of Heaven are clear,
only the wicked will not be forgiven.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.639
Xi Yan,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.680
it wasn't us who wanted to harm you.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.839
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:20.800
I...

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.920
You don't have to say anything.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.919
Let this fire

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.639
burn away the sin,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.639
and then let the person
behind the scenes

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.559
dispose of your corpses.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.159
It was the Madam.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.840
Madam, help!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840
- Save us!
- Madam, save me!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.039
- Save me!
- Madam, save me!

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.480
Madam, save us!

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.200
Shouting loudly,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.240
disturbing one's peaceful dreams.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:02.519
Your Lordship.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:05.039
This was found in Xi Yan's room.

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:13.000
Poison smoke?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.890
Committing murder
in the Governor's Residence...

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.360
Spare us, Your Lordship.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.200
It...

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.200
It was the Madam who told us to do it!

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.639
Your Lordship...

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.799
Think clearly before you answer.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.679
When did I

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.080
tell you to commit murder?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.159
Dismiss all the serving girls
who were involved

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:46.120
in this matter today.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:46.990
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.159
Your Lordship!

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.490
- Go!
- Take them away!

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:50.875
Spare us, Your Lordship!

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.039
Get up!

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.440
Please let me go, Your Lordship!

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.600
- Your Lordship!
- Go!

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:00.519
Hurry up!

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:02.360
Your Lordship!

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:03.519
Go!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.960
Yu,

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:11.279
I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.440
You can't possibly
be truly angry, can you?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.080
Over a mere dancer?

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:22.559
A dancer is certainly insignificant,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.399
but what if she is a concubine
of the Governor's Residence?

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480
A concubine?

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:28.720
Yu,

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.360
what exactly do you mean by that?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.799
Xi Yan possesses both talent and beauty,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.600
and has won my heart.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.490
I have decided to appoint Xi Yan

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.590
as the honored concubine
of the Governor's Residence.

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:52.600
Wan'er,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.919
have Xi Yan pour you tea.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.480
I greet you, Sister.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.919
Lowly servant!

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.120
Who is your Sister?

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.720
Thanks to Sister's "blessing",

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.639
I have profited from misfortune.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.000
I will surely assist Sister from now on

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.120
in serving the Governor well.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.960
(He shouldn't be back)

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.159

the Shen family case.)

(End of Episode)

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.320
Don't think that just because you
bear a slight resemblance to her,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.240
and the Governor glances
at you a few times,

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:42.240
that I wouldn't dare touch you.

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.440
Look at me.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.919
I am Shen Changning.
