Ran,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.200
I came to see you again.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.150
Today, we will talk

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.860
about a shocking case
of human trafficking

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.350
that happened in Lujia Village

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350
many years ago.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.710
The victim was once chained

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.710
for three years.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.310
After being rescued, they were robbed

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.790
and died in their own home.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.700
(Call from Liu Wanyao)

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.150
You finally came back.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.350
Are you really going to see him?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.360
He is a police officer.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.120
Of course.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.590
I came back just for him.

(Xu Jingzhi,
Professor of Criminal Psychology)

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.780
(5th Building, Wuyang University)

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920
Hello, Professor.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.990
Hello, Professor.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.590
Hello, Professor Xu.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.000
We will forget,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.240
strengthen,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.300
or even alter our memories.

(Memory anchors, factual logic)

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.400
All psychology

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.120
is based on recognizing objective facts

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.840
and finding the truth.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.280
How can we use known information

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.240
as an anchor

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.470
to find the truth hidden

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.400
in someone else's mind?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.370
Do any of you remember

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.660
what you ate for lunch yesterday?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.890
Please raise your hand.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.030
Those who didn't raise their hand,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.310
did you really forget?

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.120
This is just like

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.800
when the police are solving a case

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.000
and forget what the suspect looks like.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.480
When they meet, they might even ask,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.880
"Have you eaten?"

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.200
Mr. Xu,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.390
I have a question for you.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.070
I heard you used to be
a criminal police officer

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.710
and have solved

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.120
many difficult cases.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.960
Why did you leave

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.950
the front line?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.740
(Wuyang University)

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.910
Hey,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.750
do you know Xu Jingzhi?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.920
Xu Jingzhi?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.830
I don't know.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.670
I see.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.150
Mr. Xu?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.040
Please take a look.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.100
Here is his public lecture.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.580
(Abnormal Psychology,
Lecturer: Visiting Professor Xu Jingzhi)

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.120
Criminal psychology professor...

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.000
Hello,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.400
are you looking for Mr. Xu Jingzhi?

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.030
Yes, that's right.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.920
I am Xu Jingzhi's uncle.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.160
He is my nephew.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.560
I just arrived in the city,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.830
and I couldn't find my way.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.770
I need to see him now.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.000
Do you know

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.920
where I can find him?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.680
A phone number would work.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.200
Here's the thing.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.190
Mr. Xu

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.270
no longer teaches here.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800
If it's okay,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.830
you can leave me

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.040
your phone number.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.280
I'll have him get back to you.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.080
That works, too.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.400
My phone number is

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800

Closed.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.950
What a jerk.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.870
Xu Jingzhi's student

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.870
is really unreliable.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.240
Why arrange to meet me in such a place?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.660
(Entrance)

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.720
You jerk.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.270
What on earth are you up to?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.290
Didn't you say Xu Jingzhi

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.130
was here?

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.270
Where is he?

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.910
Hello?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.080
Man,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.390
who exactly are you?

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.080
Why do you want to kill me?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.670
I came to avenge Xu Jingzhi?

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.650
You got it wrong.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.480
It was Jiang Yongquan
who abducted Xu Jingzhi.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.360
I even served so many years
in prison for this.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.550
If you want revenge,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.670
you should go find Jiang Yongquan.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Don't kill me.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.150
After all, I raised Xu Jingzhi.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.320
I can be considered
half a father to him.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.030
Is this Lu Youliang?

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.230
Hello?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.680
I...

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.230
I...

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.200
Hello?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.230
Say something.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.390
Hello?

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.680
Lu Youliang?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.320
Hello?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.080
Lu Youliang,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.920
here's another one.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.480
Kid, don't blame me.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.840
Forget your past life asap

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.270
to live a good life.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.200
Do you understand?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.870
Jiang.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.160
Open your mouth.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.390
Your name is Lu Yuan now.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.710
Got it?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.870
I am your dad.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.960
What's your name?

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.030
Lu Yuan.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.600
Who are you?

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.600
My name is Lu Yuan.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.790
You can also call me Yuan.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.390
Yuan, what is this?

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.510
Lu Ran.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.910
Your name.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.670
Lu Ran.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.200
Yuan, what's your name?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.030
Lu Yuan.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.360
Why is it three characters?

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.840
This is my real name.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.260
How do you pronounce it?

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.360
I'll teach you when we get home.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.120
This is home.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.320
This is not home.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.030
Lu Yuan, go to sleep.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.380
(Lu Ran, Xu Jingzhi)

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.910
Yuan, look.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.080
Hungry?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.550
I want to eat rice cakes.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.480
I love rice cakes the most.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.320
Yuan, what do you like to eat?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.670
Lamb chop noodles.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.870
What are lamb chops?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.570
I'll take you to eat them
when we go home.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.870
Mom,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.000
eat rice cakes.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.910
I hate rice cakes the most.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.600
You little brat.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.680
Come here.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.740
I told you not to come looking for her.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.590
She's a crazy woman.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.550
It's all because of me.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.700
Don't hit my little brother.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.750
Get up, get up.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.600
You were bought.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.550
Yet you care for your little brother.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.200
Calm down, calm down.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.390
Calm down.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.680
Calm down!

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.240
What did I tell you?

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.320
Be good,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.030
and you'll take me home.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.790
Alright, good, good.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.080
Good.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.320
Yuan, didn't you promise
to take me away?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.120
Stop running!

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.560
Stand there!

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.320
Here.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.870
Give me a hand.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.770
This net feels quite heavy.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.300
I thought there were a lot of fish.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.030
But it was something like this.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.170
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.320
Captain He, Yin.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.350
This morning, two fishermen

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.280
pulled up a wax figure.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.550
(He Ya)
When it was dragged up,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.750
(Captain of CIU 1)
they found

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.190
the exposed human tissue of a hand,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.600
so they reported it to the police.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.210
There were only a tire track

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.340
(Liu Ming, CIU I Officer)
and dragging marks nearby.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.680
The murderer is bold.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.570
The wax figure is in an enclosed space.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.820
The corpse will develop

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.180
varying degrees of saponification.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.510
Send the human tissues

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.350
for comparison asap.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.480
(Yin Wei, CIU 1 Officer)

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.350
