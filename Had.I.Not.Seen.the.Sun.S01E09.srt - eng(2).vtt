Whatever happens in the future,

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.349
I'll always be with you.

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:25.190
I won't let go of your hand
so easily again.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.861
You said it.

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:34.949
After all these annoying things are over,

00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:39.329
let's forget all the unhappy stuff…

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:43.208
and start over.

CHIANG'S BARBECUE

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.206
Hsiao-tung, we're home.

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:33.336
Hsiao-tung?

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.048
Hsiao-tung, are you asleep?

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:39.634
You went to bed so early today.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.390
Hey, where are you going? Give me a hand.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:50.019
Just put the stuff down somewhere.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.230
I'm going to call Hsiao-tung.

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.942
What's wrong?

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:58.528
She's not home
and not answering her phone.

00:04:58.611 --> 00:04:59.779
Your call will be…

00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:02.657
Hello? Chen?

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:04.867
Is Hsiao-tung at your place?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.870
Okay, thank you.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:10.540
Hey, it's late. Where are you going?

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:13.501
I'm going to ride around
to see if she's on her way home.

00:06:05.553 --> 00:06:07.180
I'm home.

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:12.810
You should go.

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:15.438
Stop following me.

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.232
What happens to me now

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:20.985
is not your concern.

00:06:22.278 --> 00:06:23.946
Please go, okay?

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:32.371
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:38.044
What's up with you?
Why aren't you home yet?

00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:41.589
Why are you here with this boy
so late at night? What for?

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:45.218
Why are you injured?

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:47.512
What happened?

00:06:49.847 --> 00:06:50.765
Tell me.

00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:52.934
What is going on?

00:06:58.856 --> 00:07:00.066
It's all my fault.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.070
Explain it to me!
What do you mean it's all your fault?

00:07:04.153 --> 00:07:05.571
What does that have to do with you?

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:09.742
I told you, it's not your concern!
Didn't you understand?

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:14.288
It's my business. Stay out of it.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:18.417
Leave.

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:21.003
Leave right now.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.602
Hey, Hsiao-tung, where were you?

00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:39.313
Why are you all drenched?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.191
How did you get injured?

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:44.902
It's so late. Where were you?

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.529
I'm exhausted now.

00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:50.449
Can you not ask any questions
and let me shower first?

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:51.701
Wait a minute.

00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:54.412
Explain clearly.
What exactly happened to you?

00:07:55.413 --> 00:07:58.499
Speak up. Chiang Hsiao-tung, tell me!

00:07:58.583 --> 00:07:59.917
What exactly is going on?

00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:04.422
I accidentally hurt myself a little.

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.591
Don't lie to me!

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:10.761
Look at you. How can you possibly be okay?

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:13.556
Be honest with me.

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:16.601
Did the boy out there do something to you?

00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:17.518
No.

00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:19.854
It has nothing to do with him.

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:21.939
Can you go outside and see

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:24.358
if the boy who came back with her
is still there?

00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:26.861
Hsiao-tung.

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:27.862
What boy?

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:30.489
-Who is that boy?
-Gosh, I don't know!

00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:34.368
Just go outside and see if there is
an injured boy who is covered in blood.

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:35.328
Bring him inside.

00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:37.246
I'll force him to talk instead.

00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:40.458
Please don't go.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:41.917
It wasn't him.

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:45.212
What happened to me today
has nothing to do with him.

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:55.181
So…

00:08:57.558 --> 00:09:00.519
did someone really do
something bad to you?

00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:08.402
Hsiao-tung.

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:11.280
Tell me who bullied you.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.783
Who was it?

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:18.913
Hurry up and tell me who it was!

00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:21.165
What's his name? Tell me!

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:22.083
Who was it?

00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:29.799
Hey, hold her tight!

00:09:29.882 --> 00:09:31.717
Let me go!

00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:36.931
Let me go!

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:38.140
Stop moving around.

00:09:38.224 --> 00:09:40.393
-Let me go! No!
-Come on, Hsiao-tung, smile.

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:42.228
Smile.

00:09:42.311 --> 00:09:43.229
Smile.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:44.647
Let me go!

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:51.070
Chuang Jung-tai.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.117
Fuck.

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.244
Fan Wei-ting.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.626

BILLING AND REGISTRATION

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.937
We may ask for some info in a bit.
Is this to be examined as well?

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.021
Yes.

00:13:54.104 --> 00:13:55.773
Okay, we'll bring it in later.

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:56.899
This way, please.

EVIDENCE! FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:51.036
Miss, please step onto the white paper.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.373
Hsiao-tung.

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:58.669
The doctor is speaking to you.

00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:04.633
Take off your shoes
and step onto the white paper, all right?

00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:21.650
Before we begin examining your injuries,
we need to reconfirm your identity.

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:28.365
What is your name, age, and date of birth?

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.078
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:15:34.163 --> 00:15:35.789
Seventeen years old.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.293
My date of birth is July 23rd.

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:40.836
We'll begin the examination.

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:42.296
First, I'd like to ask,

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:44.506
is everything you're wearing right now

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.551
what you wore when the incident happened?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.101
Let me go!

00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:58.312
Yes.

00:15:58.395 --> 00:16:01.356
Then please take off all your clothes.

00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:06.278
Come on, look at the camera.

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:07.529
Look at the camera.

00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:09.782
Do I

00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:12.159
have to take them off here?

00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:14.495
I understand how you feel,

00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:18.123
but this is required as part of the exam
and evidence collection process.

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:20.000
Please bear with me.

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:45.025
Come on, Hsiao-tung, smile.

00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:47.528
Stop moving around.

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:06.171
Smile.

00:17:13.303 --> 00:17:14.304
Over here.

00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:31.572
Closer!

00:17:31.655 --> 00:17:32.823
Record her face!

00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:38.680
Trust me.

00:18:41.892 --> 00:18:44.019
I will get justice for you.

00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:47.356
Yes. Trust me.

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:52.778
I will make those who bullied you
pay the price.

00:18:53.946 --> 00:18:55.155
Trust me.

00:18:57.282 --> 00:18:58.200
Trust me.

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:22.057
FIRST FLOOR

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:48.875
Mr. Chiang, calm down.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.252
Don't touch me!

00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:59.219
How do you know my last name?

00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:02.014
You know my daughter?

00:20:05.434 --> 00:20:08.020
Are you the boy
who brought my daughter home?

00:20:08.562 --> 00:20:09.563
What's your name?

00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:12.524
What's your relationship with my daughter?

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:16.611
How could you bring her home
but let this happen to her? Speak!

00:20:20.782 --> 00:20:21.825
I'm sorry.

00:20:23.327 --> 00:20:25.329
This happened to Hsiao-tung

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.497
because of me.

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:29.291
I'm sorry.

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.252
If I had arrived earlier,

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:33.545
I could've saved her.

00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:36.590
Don't say that kind of
useless stuff to me now!

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:38.216
Let me ask you.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.303
Do you know them?

00:20:43.513 --> 00:20:44.473
Yes.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.061
So what's the connection
between you, Hsiao-tung, and them?

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:52.397
We go to the same school.

00:20:54.483 --> 00:20:55.650
We are classmates.

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:16.880
Mr. Chiang.

00:21:18.507 --> 00:21:19.424
I'm sorry.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:21.802
I failed to protect Hsiao-tung.

00:21:22.677 --> 00:21:24.888
What's the point of apologizing to me now?

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.182
What's the point of apologizing to me?

00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:40.612
Get lost.

00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:45.325
Don't ever come near us again.

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:56.920
Jen-yao!

00:21:58.422 --> 00:21:59.339
Jen-yao!

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.049
Don't go.

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:04.052
Let's go home
and start over, yeah? Jen-yao.

00:22:05.053 --> 00:22:07.347
Can you stop making
promises you can't keep?

00:22:08.515 --> 00:22:10.434
Please let me go, okay?

00:22:10.517 --> 00:22:11.351
I beg you.

00:22:11.435 --> 00:22:12.769
Let me go, okay?

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:14.938
Jen-yao! No!

00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:16.815
Jen-yao, don't.

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:19.192
I told the police

00:22:19.693 --> 00:22:22.154
that your dad planted those drugs
to frame you.

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:23.447
They're looking into it.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.240
Believe me. I'm telling the truth!

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:27.701
I've thought it through.

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:29.995
I will leave him. I'll divorce him.

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:32.456
From now on, he's no longer our concern.

00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:36.334
We can have
a fresh start for real this time.

00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:37.252
Yeah?

00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:42.716
Jen-yao.

00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:51.558
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:58.940
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:00.567
Jen-yao.

00:23:47.113 --> 00:23:47.948
Sir,

00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:49.533
how can I help you?

00:23:50.492 --> 00:23:51.535
Excuse me.

00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:53.495
I want to ask…

00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:57.624
My daughter

00:23:58.458 --> 00:23:59.668
was sexually assaulted.

00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:00.961
I want to report it.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.257
Could you tell me when this happened?

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.175
Do you know who hurt your daughter?

00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:10.387
It happened a few hours ago.

00:24:10.887 --> 00:24:12.722
We know who the perpetrators are.

00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:15.559
They're my daughter's classmates.

00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:21.273
Well, here is the name of the school
and the names of the students.

00:24:23.108 --> 00:24:25.610
Sir, are you sure
all of them are perpetrators?

00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:26.861
Very sure.

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:31.199
We came here right after the medical exam
to file a report.

00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:32.993
Okay, give me a moment.

00:24:33.076 --> 00:24:35.704
Due to regulations, this must go
to the Women and Children's Unit.

00:24:35.787 --> 00:24:36.913
I'll be right back.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.336
YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL, YEAR 2, CLASS 2

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.838
CHUANG JUNG-TAI,
FAN WEI-TING, LIN MENG-HUNG,

00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:46.131
CHEN CHE-LI, WANG YU-HSIANG, OUYANG TI

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:50.635
Buddy, let me handle this case.

00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:06.818
The officer said he wanted
to speak to us privately about something.

00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:08.236
To be honest,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.114
I have a daughter, too, just like you two.

00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:15.285
So I feel obligated to tell you this.
If we proceed with filing a report,

00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:18.997
it might cause your daughter
more harm than we can imagine.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.541
For example, sir, you just said

00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:23.460
you took her for a medical exam.

00:25:23.543 --> 00:25:25.211
Then you must be aware

00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:27.088
that the whole process

00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:29.007
is very cruel.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.718
If you were to sue,
she'd have to deal with it.

00:25:36.348 --> 00:25:39.559
Honestly, I have handled
many cases like this.

00:25:40.435 --> 00:25:44.064
I know very well
that it causes a lot of harm to a girl.

00:25:44.147 --> 00:25:45.732
If it's not handled well,

00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:48.151
that psychological trauma
will stay with her forever.

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:51.821
So I'd advise approaching this carefully.

00:25:53.198 --> 00:25:54.115
Then,

00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:56.910
sir, do you have a better suggestion?

00:25:56.993 --> 00:25:58.370
I'd suggest…

00:25:58.453 --> 00:25:59.954
I'm just suggesting

00:26:00.038 --> 00:26:04.000
that maybe
you could go talk to the school first?

00:26:04.668 --> 00:26:05.919
So

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:08.254
are you telling us not to sue them?

00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:09.798
No, sue them! Why wouldn't you?

00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:12.801
This is serious.
Of course you should sue those bastards.

00:26:12.884 --> 00:26:14.636
But right now, the most important thing

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:16.888
is your daughter's physical
and mental state, isn't it?

00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:19.683
This should be
the top priority now, right?

00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:21.976
Think about it.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.311
Once we take statements,

00:26:23.395 --> 00:26:26.940
not only will the police and prosecutors
know about this incident,

00:26:27.023 --> 00:26:29.317
but so will reporters.

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:31.528
You'd have to tell the story
more than once.

00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:33.905
Once, twice, over and over again.

00:26:33.988 --> 00:26:37.659
Even if we adults could bear it,
could a young girl?

00:26:46.918 --> 00:26:49.879
Have you chosen
the outfit for tomorrow's campaigning?

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.424
I've picked a few here for you to see.

00:26:54.092 --> 00:26:55.301
Is this your first election?

00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:57.762
We'll be canvassing
at the market in the evening.

00:26:57.846 --> 00:26:59.180
If you put me in those,

00:26:59.681 --> 00:27:01.891
what will the folks there think of me?

00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:08.273
There's a white suit
and a knit shirt in that closet.

00:27:08.356 --> 00:27:09.649
I'll wear those.

00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:20.535
But if you wear white to the market,
won't it get dirty easily?

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:22.454
Besides,

00:27:22.537 --> 00:27:24.038
it'll be obvious if you sweat.

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:28.793
Dirt and sweat are exactly
what I'm looking for.

00:27:29.711 --> 00:27:31.171
That way, everyone will see

00:27:31.254 --> 00:27:33.506
how hard I'm working for my husband.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.508
I'll look down-to-earth too.

00:27:37.218 --> 00:27:41.097
Dirty folks will only feel close
to those who also get dirty.

00:27:41.973 --> 00:27:44.058
It'll be pointless if I look clean.

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:55.320
Fang, what is it?

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.698
I've suppressed the report.
I told them to go to the school.

00:27:58.782 --> 00:28:00.074
I thought

00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:02.368
you could handle that part.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:06.164
But if they decide to sue later

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:09.834
and go to the press,
I may not be able to keep it under wraps.

00:28:12.003 --> 00:28:13.171
Well done.

00:28:13.797 --> 00:28:15.048
Leave the rest to me.

00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:22.639
Hsiao-tung.

00:28:27.477 --> 00:28:30.271
Hsiao-tung, I cooked something.

00:28:30.772 --> 00:28:32.690
Why don't you get up and eat a little?

00:28:33.858 --> 00:28:35.693
You haven't eaten all day.

00:28:36.736 --> 00:28:38.738
Eat a bit and then go back to sleep, okay?

00:28:50.124 --> 00:28:51.626
Come on, get up.

00:28:52.168 --> 00:28:53.336
Get up, quickly.

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:54.963
Eat something.

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:57.757
Do you want
to starve yourself to death? Get up.

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:01.135
Get up.

00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:10.061
Hello?

00:29:11.813 --> 00:29:12.856
Sorry.

00:29:12.939 --> 00:29:14.566
We're not working today.

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:18.820
No, it's just…

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:24.909
Something happened at home.

00:29:25.743 --> 00:29:27.328
So we may not do business

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.498
for a while. I'm sorry.

00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:06.492
If you wanna frame someone,

00:30:06.576 --> 00:30:10.830
you'd better get them
to willingly take the blame for you.

00:30:10.914 --> 00:30:13.499
The same goes for
playing around with women.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:17.712
They've told the hospital and the police
and are ready to sue you.

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:19.172
What's your plan?

00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:28.014
If I hadn't had a guy in the police
to intercept the report quickly enough…

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:31.684
this time,

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:35.313
I might as well
have dropped out of the race

00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:38.232
because of you, my loser son.

00:30:49.452 --> 00:30:51.704
You fucking suck at hurting people.

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:56.209
But you're pretty good
at hurting your boss.

00:31:00.463 --> 00:31:01.381
Boss.

00:31:01.881 --> 00:31:02.757
Boss.

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:27.365
Get this straight.

00:31:28.616 --> 00:31:32.870
I don't have to clean up
all your fucking messes.

00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:34.956
I, Ouyang Hsiang,

00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:37.417
have other sons besides you!

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:39.919
That's enough.

00:31:40.003 --> 00:31:43.256
He just made bad friends
and was led astray.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:45.299
You can't blame it all on him.

00:31:45.383 --> 00:31:47.802
Besides, now is a critical time.

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:49.846
Don't turn this into something.

00:31:53.975 --> 00:31:54.934
I know.

00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:03.818
This one…

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:07.530
is on you to fix.

00:32:12.368 --> 00:32:13.745
It's okay now.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.011
Hsiao-tung.

00:32:32.263 --> 00:32:33.306
Hsiao-tung.

00:32:34.098 --> 00:32:37.852
Dad and I gotta go take care of something.
We'll be back in the afternoon.

00:32:38.603 --> 00:32:42.106
I asked your aunt to come over.
If you want something to eat, tell her.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.107
Okay?

00:32:49.322 --> 00:32:50.490
Okay, I'm off.

00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.423
Since you've never celebrated Christmas,

00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:08.966
how about

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.843
we celebrate it together this year?

00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:19.889
That's all I know.

00:35:20.681 --> 00:35:22.266
I've told you everything.

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:24.018
Can I go now?

00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:27.897
This is a serious matter.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.774
You were there that day too.

00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:33.110
Are you sure
you described exactly what you saw?

00:35:34.237 --> 00:35:35.988
Save me!

00:35:36.072 --> 00:35:38.991
Hurry, call the police! Save me!

00:35:41.702 --> 00:35:43.621
Yes, I'm sure.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:49.168
That day, I heard Hsiao-tung herself say
she wanted to stick around longer.

00:35:49.252 --> 00:35:52.630
And she seemed to be enjoying herself.

00:36:00.012 --> 00:36:01.389
Go and get some rest.

00:36:03.516 --> 00:36:05.101
Next, Chang En-ya.

00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:12.525
Don't be scared.

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:15.278
From now on, we're friends.

00:36:15.945 --> 00:36:17.947
Some secrets between friends

00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:19.991
are meant to be kept.

00:36:38.342 --> 00:36:39.176
Idiot.

00:36:39.969 --> 00:36:40.803
Damn.

00:36:40.886 --> 00:36:42.388
Fuck, you scared her off.

00:37:35.107 --> 00:37:37.651
It was Hsiao-tung
who asked us to hang out.

00:37:39.445 --> 00:37:40.946
I have proof here.

00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:43.032
She sent us a text.

00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:45.618
It says,

00:37:46.118 --> 00:37:48.412
"Let's meet at the entrance
after school today."

00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:49.455
"Don't forget."

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.502
Just because she asked,

00:37:55.169 --> 00:37:56.879
you think you can treat her that way?

00:37:56.962 --> 00:37:58.214
Are you guys beasts?

00:38:07.473 --> 00:38:09.225
After you all went out,

00:38:09.308 --> 00:38:10.726
what happened?

00:38:11.394 --> 00:38:13.979
Why did Chiang Hsiao-tung say
that you raped her?

00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:22.738
Everything was normal at first.

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:25.282
We were all just singing karaoke.

00:38:25.366 --> 00:38:26.909
Hsiao-tung suddenly said

00:38:27.493 --> 00:38:30.079
that she heard we usually play hard

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.040
and wanted to see
how intense we could get.

00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:36.335
Truth is, we're not who she thinks we are.

00:38:37.002 --> 00:38:38.003
But

00:38:38.587 --> 00:38:40.714
I didn't want to look lame
in front of her,

00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:43.926
so I brought her
to hang out with Wei-ting and the others.

00:38:44.427 --> 00:38:46.971
I also asked Meng-hung to bring some beer.

00:38:47.054 --> 00:38:48.139
A few drinks in,

00:38:48.973 --> 00:38:50.599
Hsiao-tung got drunk.

00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:53.561
Then…

00:39:01.318 --> 00:39:03.112
It's okay, Ouyang Ti.

00:39:03.195 --> 00:39:04.572
Tell the truth.

00:39:04.655 --> 00:39:05.489
Yeah.

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:10.828
Then Hsiao-tung said she felt hot.

00:39:11.412 --> 00:39:14.748
She started taking off her clothes.
I didn't stop her.

00:39:14.832 --> 00:39:17.293
I was afraid something might happen
if she got too drunk.

00:39:17.877 --> 00:39:20.463
Later, I took her
somewhere she could rest.

00:39:22.506 --> 00:39:23.591
Suddenly, she

00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:25.968
hugged me

00:39:27.553 --> 00:39:28.637
and kissed me.

00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:37.313
I was also there to help hold her.

00:39:38.522 --> 00:39:39.940
She kissed me too.

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:43.319
And the other students.

00:39:46.864 --> 00:39:48.407
She was so forward.

00:39:48.491 --> 00:39:49.825
And we all drank.

00:39:50.326 --> 00:39:52.828
Of course, things happened later.

00:39:53.412 --> 00:39:55.206
But we really didn't rape her.

00:39:56.207 --> 00:39:57.291
What are you saying?

00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.210
What are you saying?

00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:02.171
My daughter didn't drink.

00:40:02.254 --> 00:40:04.548
You hear me?
My daughter didn't drink at all!

00:40:05.758 --> 00:40:07.593
You beasts

00:40:07.676 --> 00:40:09.178
raped my daughter

00:40:09.261 --> 00:40:10.471
and hurt her.

00:40:10.554 --> 00:40:13.390
And now you're telling these lies
to blame it all on her!

00:40:13.474 --> 00:40:14.725
Do you even have a heart?

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:16.143
I'll kill you, I tell you!

00:40:16.227 --> 00:40:18.521
Hey, don't. Are you threatening us?

00:40:18.604 --> 00:40:20.648
If you don't wanna talk,
we'll meet in court.

00:40:20.731 --> 00:40:22.066
I'll sue your ass.

00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:24.151
Hey, my son is such a good boy.

00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:26.612
Clearly, your daughter seduced them,
so this happened.

00:40:26.695 --> 00:40:28.781
What else do you wanna do to my son?

00:40:28.864 --> 00:40:30.950
That's enough. Everyone, please calm down.

00:40:31.033 --> 00:40:33.536
We're here today
to resolve the issue, not to argue.

00:40:34.036 --> 00:40:35.204
Okay?

00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:37.998
Everyone, sit down.
Miss, take the students outside.

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:40.000
Hey, all of you, let's go.

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:42.253
-It's okay. I'm here. No worries.
-Wait outside.

00:40:43.045 --> 00:40:44.338
It's okay. I'm here.

00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:45.506
No worries.

00:40:54.848 --> 00:40:55.766
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang,

00:40:56.642 --> 00:40:58.811
regardless of whether
Hsiao-tung initiated it or not,

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:01.397
we shouldn't have done this.

00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:03.440
This is wrong.

00:41:05.276 --> 00:41:06.694
Please forgive us.

00:41:07.194 --> 00:41:08.737
I'm really sorry.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.826
I think

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:15.869
we should all calm down first.

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:20.541
We also got the perspectives of students
who went with Chiang Hsiao-tung that day.

00:41:21.417 --> 00:41:23.919
Both female students mentioned

00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:27.590
Chiang Hsiao-tung wanted to stay behind
and told them to leave first.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.717
They also asserted

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.554
that it didn't feel like
Chiang Hsiao-tung was coerced that day.

00:41:33.637 --> 00:41:36.765
In fact, we pulled up
the security camera footage

00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:40.978
and saw that Chiang Hsiao-tung
happily got into Ouyang Ti's vehicle.

00:41:41.562 --> 00:41:42.980
She didn't seem coerced.

00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:46.567
It was clearly consensual.

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:49.278
What? She sobered up and now regrets it,

00:41:49.361 --> 00:41:52.406
so she turns around and blames it on us?

00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:54.700
Consensual?

00:41:55.492 --> 00:41:57.620
We took our daughter for a medical exam.

00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:00.873
She's injured all over!
You call that consensual?

00:42:01.457 --> 00:42:03.667
Your sons acted like beasts!

00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:05.961
Now you're blaming it all on our daughter.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.005
I'm gonna sue them.

00:42:08.088 --> 00:42:10.299
I'm gonna sue them
until they're all in jail!

00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:12.551
Go ahead and sue! We didn't do anything!

00:42:12.635 --> 00:42:13.886
I'm not scared!

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.847
How about my boy just compromises

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.140
and marries her?

00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:19.683
Marrying a girl like that?

00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:21.226
Forget it.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.062
-That's right.
-Go ahead and sue!

00:42:23.145 --> 00:42:25.814
Let the whole world know
how dirty your daughter is.

00:42:25.898 --> 00:42:29.068
-That's right.
-Sleeping with a bunch of guys this young.

00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:30.235
Shameless!

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:33.113
Let's see how she'll live from now on.

00:42:33.197 --> 00:42:35.574
No one will marry her.
What's the point of living?

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:37.451
All you really want is money!

00:42:37.534 --> 00:42:39.370
-That's right.
-You think I can't tell?

00:42:39.453 --> 00:42:40.788
-What?
-You think we're fools?

00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:42.164
What are you saying?

00:42:42.247 --> 00:42:43.540
What's this? What did I say?

00:42:44.124 --> 00:42:45.376
Get back! What's this?

00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:47.002
What are you doing?

00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:50.047
Enough, stop arguing.

00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:53.175
If something has happened,
we will resolve it.

00:42:54.551 --> 00:42:55.511
This matter

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.932
is something all of us parents here today
have to take responsibility for.

00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:02.768
They are minors.

00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:05.354
They shouldn't have had
the forbidden fruit to begin with.

00:43:06.063 --> 00:43:11.402
But whether it was consensual or not,

00:43:12.486 --> 00:43:15.447
it's always the girl who suffers the most.

00:43:16.198 --> 00:43:18.575
Your daughter wouldn't want

00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:20.744
everyone to know about this, would she?

00:43:23.122 --> 00:43:24.123
If

00:43:24.832 --> 00:43:26.959
you're willing to keep this quiet

00:43:27.042 --> 00:43:28.419
and not take it to court,

00:43:28.961 --> 00:43:32.256
we can compromise.

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:35.384
I'm willing to offer a sum of money

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:38.011
so that Chiang Hsiao-tung
can start a new life.

00:43:38.512 --> 00:43:40.013
As for the amount,

00:43:40.514 --> 00:43:41.682
well,

00:43:41.765 --> 00:43:43.809
you can write whatever you want, yeah?

00:43:43.892 --> 00:43:45.477
We don't want that kind of money!

00:43:45.978 --> 00:43:49.606
Save it for your precious sons' coffins!

00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.150
-Let's go.
-Say what?

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:53.193
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:43:53.736 --> 00:43:56.655
-Mr. and Mrs. Chiang!
-I won't give you a cent! I'll sue you!

00:43:57.322 --> 00:43:58.615
Stop arguing.

00:43:58.699 --> 00:44:00.075
-What the heck?
-Sir.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.831
-Did you guys see Hsiao-tung's dad?
-Yeah.

00:44:05.914 --> 00:44:09.334
Fuck, his fists are huge. Who'd win
if you went head-to-head with him?

00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:10.294
Damn, hard to say.

00:44:10.377 --> 00:44:12.045
Depends on what you're going for, yeah?

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.257
Hey, but what we're doing…

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:16.675
-What?
-It doesn't feel right.

00:44:16.759 --> 00:44:18.969
-What the hell are you saying?
-Go on, say it.

00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:22.181
"My son is such a good boy."

00:44:24.558 --> 00:44:27.311
Hey, don't. Don't pick on him.

00:44:27.394 --> 00:44:29.730
Che-li is usually a good boy,
I know, isn't he?

00:44:29.813 --> 00:44:32.816
-He's the best.
-Look at how neat his tie is, right?

00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:35.444
Hey, Che-li.

00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:36.403
Not mad, are you?

00:44:36.487 --> 00:44:38.238
-No.
-No getting mad, okay?

00:44:38.322 --> 00:44:39.323
-Hey!
-Stop it.

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:40.657
-Guys, look!
-It hurts.

00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:43.952
Fuck.

00:44:44.036 --> 00:44:46.121
Idiot, what's so damn scary?
We're a big crowd.

00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:47.414
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:49.666
How come you look so awful?

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.502
Are you feeling pissy?

00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:52.961
Why is your head green?

00:44:53.045 --> 00:44:54.922
Hey, fatty, that's too much!

00:44:55.005 --> 00:44:57.966
He finally got a girl,
but we all screwed her before he could.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.051
Now you laugh at him.

00:44:59.134 --> 00:44:59.968
Hey, Jen-yao!

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.597
Wow, so fierce. I'm scared.

00:45:05.516 --> 00:45:06.934
What?

00:45:07.017 --> 00:45:08.310
You want to fight?

00:45:08.393 --> 00:45:09.728
Six against one. No fear here.

00:45:09.812 --> 00:45:11.563
Come on, fucking loser!

00:45:11.647 --> 00:45:14.024
Li Jen-yao, your girl is such a good bang.

00:45:14.107 --> 00:45:15.567
I had a dream about it today.

00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:18.111
Have you boned her before?
We're brothers if you have.

00:45:25.452 --> 00:45:26.703
CHIANG'S BARBECUE
