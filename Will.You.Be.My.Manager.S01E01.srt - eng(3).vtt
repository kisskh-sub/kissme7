00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.880
Yeah.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.340
Hang on.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.910
I found this by accident.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.000
It's nothing, you'll think I'm fooling you.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.960
What is it?

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.500
There's a secret in this shelf.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.060
You can find bread in the books.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.170
What are you saying?

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.050
It's true.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.050
Want to check for yourself?

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.840
Madeleines are from France, right?

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.110
Here.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.820
I'm only sharing this secret with you, okay?

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.000
First, turn to page 111.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.970
Page 111...

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.350
Page 111.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.030
Now, close your eyes.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.110
Madeleines, appear!

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.710
Madeleines, appear!

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.170
You can open your eyes.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.090
Wow!

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.170
Did this really come from the book?

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.400
- Yeah.
- Do other pastries appear, too?

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.670
Apple pies, croissants, salt bread, melon bread...

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.560
And pizza!

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.130
I want Chicago pizza!

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.580
Pizza?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.580
Okay, pizza has to be from America.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.860
Here.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.680
Page 111...

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.210
Here it is.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.760
I'll close my eyes, okay?

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.080
Pizza, appear!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.460
Gosh.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.490
A pizza won't appear.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.370
Come on...

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.480
The book, please.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.140
Here you go.

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.480
[Combined Class, Class 3-A]

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.040
[Major Practical Workshop]

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.190
We're here for your major's practical course.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.000
This is a combined class with a long history and tradition.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.900
Each team has one management major and two acting majors.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.060
Other schools have mid-year exams, but what about us?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.750
We have a mid-year project.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.440
I'll announce the teams for this semester.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.560
Ji Ah, Ba Reun, Min Soo.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.070
Yes!

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.520
Shin Ji Ah will work me to death.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.230
Seul Gi, Ji Ho, Yoo Jin.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:43.000
And... Bit Na, Kyung Joon, Jung Hoon.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.510
And the worrying and promising final team,
Hana, Eun Ho, and Si Woo.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.660
You came from an ordinary school, didn't you?

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.680
The look of someone who won't be much help.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.150
No, no, no.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.340
You should help her if she's inexperienced.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.180
Ji Ah, help Hana too.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.780
I will.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.430
Yeah, right.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.440
Thanks.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.980
Ji Ah, you're the only one I can count on.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.210
That's hard to say since it's a group project.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.270
Eun Ho is also top of his major, right?

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.700
Yeah.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.320
Should we have a basketball match among the group leaders?

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.490
Hey, it's freaking cold these days.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.890
So? You're scared?

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.830
If you're scared, then screw off.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.420
Me?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.080
You talking about me?

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.200
It's on. The loser treats everyone to a meal.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.130
"The loser treats everyone to a meal."

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.340
Hana-chan!

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.610
We're having a basketball match. Wanna watch?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.860
Of course, I'll be there. I'm your manager.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.980
Ji Ah, you're coming too, right?

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.470
I have a study session for my regular classes.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.830
I thought you'd come along.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.970
I'd rather use that time to finish more practice questions.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.540
Nice shot!

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.610
Over to you.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.780
Take photos. Now! Come on.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.710
- Zoom in!
- Eun Ho, Si Woo!

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.560
You can do it!

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.500
Haru-poof! What about me?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.670
You're only cheering for your group mates!

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.460
So what?

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.430
- We'll win anyway.
- Oh my gosh!

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.810
Did you hear him?

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:26.010
Sorry! He said victory will be ours!

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.720
Eun Ho! Si Woo! You can do it!

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.650
Do your best!

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.300
Nice shot!

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.780
Food's on you.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.860
Hey.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.760
Leave him be. He'll appear when he's calmed down.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.750
This isn't the first time anyway.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.650
Great job!

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.880
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.290
- One for you.
- Thanks!

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.230
What about Eun Ho?

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.970
Dude, I'm nervous.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.030
Make sure it doesn't show.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.540
Where are we going?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.870
The club room. It's our hideout, the Drama Research Club.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.650
- Hideout?
- We're almost there.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.520
[Welcome]

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.860
Hang on.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.340
[Welcome]

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.290
Why are they blocking the path?

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.670
Surprise!

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.950
Yes?
[Epilogue]

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.690
Please have a seat.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.200
You don't have to feel nervous.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.860
Understood.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.570
Alright, let's begin.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.870
Hana Hirose's quite the buzz now.
You're her classmate, right?

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.740
How is she as a student?

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.590
The worst.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.900
She's horrible, the most terrible person ever.
