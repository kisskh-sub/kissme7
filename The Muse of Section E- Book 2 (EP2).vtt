Happy New Year, Jay.

Why did you
even do that, Jay-jay?

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.950
Yuri asked for my permission
to bring you to school.

Are you okay?

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.250
My only wish is

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:02.842
that you give me a chance.

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:45.341
You're such an
attention-seeker!

00:10:45.341 --> 00:10:46.425
You were the one
who told me it's kapour,

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:48.010
before you jumped
and jumped there asshole!

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.345
- Attention-seeker!
- Just like you!

00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:50.513
- You just don't want to be humiliated,
- Stupid!

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:51.389
- putting all the blame on me.
- Stupid!

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:52.390
Kapour!

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.724
- It’s parkour.
- Kapour

00:10:53.724 --> 00:10:54.724
You said kapour.

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:56.310
Profanity.

00:10:58.104 --> 00:11:00.022
Wait, no!

00:11:00.523 --> 00:11:01.357
Wait!

00:11:01.357 --> 00:11:02.483
Nope, that's the rule.

00:11:04.902 --> 00:11:05.903
What's going on?

00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:07.956
Nope, you know the rules.

00:11:08.073 --> 00:11:09.073
What rule?

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.705
One profanity, one…

00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:17.665
One what?

No!

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.248
So, what can you say class?

00:12:00.124 --> 00:12:02.668
Did Pandora's actions
cause chaos in our world?

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.589
It's all because of Pandora,

00:12:04.614 --> 00:12:06.076
because she didn't listen.

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:07.829
If only she had followed orders.

00:12:11.343 --> 00:12:12.343
Ma’am.

00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:16.056
The good thing about
what Pandora did,

00:12:16.056 --> 00:12:17.600
is that she fostered hope.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.601
So you're saying,

00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.228
we should thank her
because she was stubborn?

00:12:21.896 --> 00:12:22.563
No.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:25.599
What I meant was,
it’s unfair to judge that quick.

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:28.569
We can't blame her
for being curious.

00:12:29.904 --> 00:12:31.489
Then who should
we blame for it?

00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:33.949
That is called accountability.

00:12:34.784 --> 00:12:36.869
If you'll blame it all on one person

00:12:36.869 --> 00:12:38.454
instead of looking at yourself,

00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:40.456
that's not accountability.

00:12:40.539 --> 00:12:42.166
That's called cowardice.

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:45.002
You're selfish and a coward.

00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:46.337
Yes Jasper Jean?

00:12:46.337 --> 00:12:48.464
Maybe you're both right.

00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:51.717
Maybe you both have a point, you
just need to understand one another.

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:52.717
Right?

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:54.178
Right?

00:12:55.587 --> 00:12:56.755

Okay, that's enough.

00:13:02.144 --> 00:13:03.938
Since we're on this topic,

00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:06.023
might as well write
an essay about this.

00:13:06.232 --> 00:13:07.232
Huh?

Annoying.

Bring out one whole sheet of paper.

- Hurry up.
- Can I have a piece of paper, Jay?

- Jay, me too!

for too much!

This is five pesos.

That's five pesos, alright?

00:13:22.623 --> 00:13:24.291
- Can I have some?
- Ten for you.

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:25.484

I'm here to apologize,

You're really something, huh?

to apologize, and join you as well."

It’s not that I don’t want you, Jay.

Let Yuri do that to
you one more time,

Wait a minute.

Like really, really angry?

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.283
Is that what you’ve been
thinking of this whole time?

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:19.768
Is that why you've
been absent-minded?

00:22:20.023 --> 00:22:21.691
Answer me, quick.

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:23.961
Have you ever seen

Yes, a lot of times.

00:22:30.355 --> 00:22:31.355
How?

00:22:34.466 --> 00:22:35.592
One thing I'll never forget

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:37.135
is when he got
so mad at Yuri.

00:22:38.296 --> 00:22:39.296
Damn.

00:22:39.632 --> 00:22:40.800
What happened?

00:22:42.622 --> 00:22:43.915
We don't know why.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.115
All we know is he
was so mad at Yuri.

00:22:46.383 --> 00:22:48.218
He couldn't stop
punching Yuri on the face.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.082
Why, what happened?

00:22:50.107 --> 00:22:51.233
I don't know.

00:22:52.036 --> 00:22:54.371
All I remember was Ella
kept crying on the side.

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:56.089
She was begging them to stop.

00:22:56.874 --> 00:22:58.042
It was so chaotic.

00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:00.155
What did you do then?

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:02.033
Nothing.

00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.555
Jay, no one can stop Keifer
when he's that mad.

00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:07.603
If we get close,
we'll get involved too.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.044
I don't want to get punched
so I stayed away.

00:23:14.912 --> 00:23:16.830
I feel bad for Yuri.

00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:19.902
No.

00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:21.626
Yuri's a dumbass.

00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:24.516
What do you mean dumbass?

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.270
Yuri is a coward.

00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:30.784
That's why he is
always clinging to Keifer,

00:23:31.256 --> 00:23:32.883
because he is
afraid to confront him.

00:23:35.203 --> 00:23:36.996
Jay, he doesn't fight fair too.

00:23:38.032 --> 00:23:40.034
He makes a move
without us knowing.

00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:41.732
Yuri?

00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:42.821
Yes!

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.825
It's my first time
hearing you talk like that.

00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:51.309
That's why I told you,

00:23:51.334 --> 00:23:52.627
I don't want him for you.

00:23:52.736 --> 00:23:55.155
So if he tries to
court you, don't let him.

00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:03.346
Let's watch.

00:24:04.582 --> 00:24:06.959
I've been saving the
ice cream for the movie.

00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:08.897
You choose,
what do you want?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.314
What do you feel like watching?

00:24:12.314 --> 00:24:14.024
Oh wait, my ice cream.

00:24:15.984 --> 00:24:17.360
Anything.

00:24:17.903 --> 00:24:19.446
You said you have
some good ones

00:24:19.446 --> 00:24:20.697
that aren't available
to watch online.

00:24:20.697 --> 00:24:22.365
Yes, just you wait.

00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:24.525
Promise, these
are all good stuff.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.110
Hey! What kind of
good stuff are those?

00:24:27.846 --> 00:24:28.847
Huh?

00:24:28.872 --> 00:24:31.808
- I'm seeing a smirk!
- Jay!

00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:33.084
Hey, behave yourself!

00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:34.423
Who do you think I am?

00:24:34.811 --> 00:24:37.189
Ci, it stinks!

00:24:37.214 --> 00:24:38.423
Jay, there are
only two of us,

00:24:38.423 --> 00:24:39.823
why are you putting
the blame on me?

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.061
Ouch!

00:24:43.089 --> 00:24:44.173
My stomach hurts.

00:24:45.013 --> 00:24:47.140
There, karma.

00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:48.909
It's because of your greediness.

00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:50.560
Too much
ice cream for you.

00:24:51.832 --> 00:24:53.834
Ci, it really stinks!

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.569
Go run to the bathroom!

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:57.596
Hurry up, or you might
make a mess here!

00:25:03.229 --> 00:25:04.229
What is this?

00:25:57.127 --> 00:26:01.214
Cut it off to be sure!

00:26:01.214 --> 00:26:02.591
Let's go!

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.405
You probably know why
you're here right now, right?

00:26:06.571 --> 00:26:08.298
Obviously.

00:26:08.387 --> 00:26:09.787
So you can jump me with your goons.

00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:16.632
You think you're tough, huh?

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:19.225
You really targeted Jay-jay, huh?

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:20.984
She was mine first.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.571
What now?

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.217
Stupid!

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.134
I'm getting impatient,
let's do this!

00:26:29.534 --> 00:26:30.534
Who's up?

00:26:32.131 --> 00:26:33.843
Your turn, bro.

00:26:35.832 --> 00:26:36.833
Let's go!

00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:39.127
You messed with the wrong person.

00:26:41.004 --> 00:26:42.505
My turn, my turn!

00:26:43.965 --> 00:26:46.426
Screw you, you speak English
but you're still stupid, huh!

00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:55.018
There you go, let's go Ci!

00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:56.294
Let's go, Ci!

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.443
Three, two, one!

00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:02.554
Happy New Year!

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:12.915
Here it comes, here it comes.

00:27:20.418 --> 00:27:21.711
You bastard!

00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:23.672
One more!

00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:26.979
Happy New Year!

00:27:27.016 --> 00:27:29.327
Alright, alright!
I'm not yet done!

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.066
Let him go, let him go, let him go.

00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:33.289
Let's go, Keifer!

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:40.629
There you go guys, I have
someone to introduce to you today.

00:27:40.897 --> 00:27:42.857
Let's go!

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.820
Fuck you!

00:27:55.036 --> 00:27:56.121
Oh my god.

00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:57.414
Jay, success!

00:28:04.295 --> 00:28:05.880
Why did you do that to Kiko?

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.020
Jay, Keifer will get mad at me.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.439
I don't care!

00:28:23.184 --> 00:28:24.977
Jay, you know what
Kiko did to you, right?

00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.427
It's a serious matter.
It's not that simple.

00:28:27.694 --> 00:28:28.737
He almost—

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.088
Yes, he did hurt me
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

00:28:30.113 --> 00:28:32.282
but what you guys
did is too much!

00:28:32.757 --> 00:28:34.551
Is hurting Kiko not enough,

00:28:34.576 --> 00:28:36.571
the night you guys saved me?

00:28:36.761 --> 00:28:38.471
And wasn't he expelled?

00:28:38.496 --> 00:28:39.748
Wasn't that enough?

00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:42.292
But that's assault, Jay.

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:43.665
That's a different matter.

00:28:44.794 --> 00:28:46.254
And we're talking about you.

00:28:46.688 --> 00:28:49.004
We're talking about me
but no one told me.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.721
I'm not involved again, huh?

00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:53.052
And this is how I find out?

00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:55.047
None of you wanted me to find out!

00:28:56.781 --> 00:28:58.324
Jay please, don't go!

00:28:58.349 --> 00:28:59.350
Keifer might look for you,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.618
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

00:29:00.643 --> 00:29:02.353
Tell them I woke up late.

00:29:02.353 --> 00:29:03.813
Jay, you can't.

00:29:03.838 --> 00:29:05.048
What do you mean?

00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:07.609
Keifer knows when I lie.
Jay, don't.

00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:08.985
Then be good at it!

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.261
It's not like that!

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:24.417
Go away!

00:29:29.464 --> 00:29:31.049
What hospital is he in?

00:29:33.718 --> 00:29:36.304
Ci-N, don't wait
for me to ask again.

00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:37.472
One.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.141
Two.

00:29:54.964 --> 00:29:56.299
I don't know what I'm feeling

00:29:56.324 --> 00:29:58.159
now that I'm facing Kiko.

00:29:59.494 --> 00:30:00.578
Anger?

00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:02.454
Rage?

00:30:03.164 --> 00:30:04.165
Pity?

00:30:13.174 --> 00:30:14.174
Kiko…

00:30:18.959 --> 00:30:19.973
How are you?

00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:22.603
I just found out...

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.436
about what happened to you.

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:27.689
Don't.

00:30:28.022 --> 00:30:29.023
Huh?

00:30:30.233 --> 00:30:31.776
Don't feel bad for me.

00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:33.778
I deserve this.

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:37.057
- But...
- What I did

00:30:38.324 --> 00:30:39.505
is unacceptable.

00:30:40.243 --> 00:30:41.411
I know that.

00:30:44.497 --> 00:30:45.665
Jay-jay…

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.838
I'm really sorry.

00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.676
I don't know why
I did what I did.

00:30:58.177 --> 00:31:00.555
I don't know, something
came over me and…

00:31:01.681 --> 00:31:03.016
it just wasn't me.

00:31:06.644 --> 00:31:08.104
I was brokenhearted because…

00:31:09.814 --> 00:31:11.274
Because you rejected me and…

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.363
These are just stupid excuses,

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:19.223
it doesn't excuse what I did.

00:31:23.036 --> 00:31:24.454
Please forgive me, Jay-jay.

00:31:29.876 --> 00:31:31.461
Apology accepted.

00:31:34.213 --> 00:31:35.214
Really?

00:31:37.842 --> 00:31:41.679
Just don't do it again, Kiko.

00:31:50.406 --> 00:31:51.820
It's just me.

00:31:52.482 --> 00:31:53.984
You can stop looking around.

00:31:59.822 --> 00:32:03.534
[phone buzzing]

00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:09.025
So your classmates are
already looking for you?

00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:12.777
No. Let them be.

00:32:15.964 --> 00:32:17.632
You know you're
really lucky, Jay.

00:32:19.217 --> 00:32:22.053
Your friends,
your classmates they…

00:32:22.595 --> 00:32:24.055
they care about you.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.675
So much, they're
willing to fight for you.

00:32:34.649 --> 00:32:36.109
They weren't
like that with Ella.

00:32:41.155 --> 00:32:42.674
How are you here?

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.463
When will you be discharged?

00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:48.079
About a month.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.331
But uhm,

00:32:50.847 --> 00:32:54.351
they say around six to eight
months for my full recovery.

00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:58.756
And then I have to
undergo physical therapy.

00:32:59.632 --> 00:33:01.011
How about your studies?

00:33:03.177 --> 00:33:04.637
I'm expelled, Jay.

00:33:05.138 --> 00:33:06.139
Remember?

00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:11.070
What did Freya say, by the way?

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.524
Nothing.

00:33:16.524 --> 00:33:18.317
I mean we broke up so…

00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:20.876
she said she didn't want
a disabled boyfriend.

00:33:23.698 --> 00:33:25.783
That girl is really something.

00:33:26.701 --> 00:33:29.495
Well I mean,
it's just how she is.

00:33:31.164 --> 00:33:32.498
When you no longer benefit her,

00:33:32.523 --> 00:33:34.859
she just drops you
like a hot potato.

00:33:35.752 --> 00:33:36.753
I can see that.

00:33:41.257 --> 00:33:42.967
She wasn't always
like that though.

00:33:44.177 --> 00:33:47.007
I remember she was
really nice to me and Mykel.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.891
When we were younger
and during summer classes.

00:33:52.268 --> 00:33:54.145
It was really only recently
that she changed.

00:33:56.022 --> 00:33:57.690
What happened to her?

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.031
Ask Keifer and Yuri.

00:34:05.573 --> 00:34:06.574
Huh?

00:34:07.492 --> 00:34:08.910
From what I remember,

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.499
Freya, when her boyfriend died,

00:34:14.524 --> 00:34:15.525
and then,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.210
afterwards...

00:34:17.776 --> 00:34:21.738
she was passed around
Keifer, Yuri, and Aries.

00:34:34.049 --> 00:34:35.707
There's Jay.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.274
Where have you been?

00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:42.860
I woke up late!

00:34:42.975 --> 00:34:44.656
Ci-N said you went somewhere.

00:34:48.023 --> 00:34:50.400
Yes! That's why I took so long.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.790
Why weren't you answering your phone?

00:34:53.281 --> 00:34:54.282
Uhm...

00:34:55.623 --> 00:34:57.583
Because I knew it was you calling.

00:34:57.857 --> 00:35:00.144
Next time tell me
if you'll go somewhere.

00:35:00.227 --> 00:35:01.520
So we don't have to worry.

00:35:02.135 --> 00:35:04.346
What if the incident
with Rory happens again?

00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:07.690
Sorry..

00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:10.794
Promise next time, I'll tell you.

00:35:12.388 --> 00:35:13.388
All of you.

00:35:14.008 --> 00:35:15.602
I wonder what's up?

00:35:16.561 --> 00:35:18.187
I just looked at the two of them,

00:35:18.248 --> 00:35:20.333
but Josh seems to be watching.

00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:25.407
Get out of there, I'll sit.

00:35:26.487 --> 00:35:27.488
Go away!

00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:39.542
I wonder what happened to Freya

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:41.438
that she ended up
with Keifer and Yuri?

00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:43.412
Then Aries too?

00:35:43.846 --> 00:35:45.378
Ah, right.

00:35:45.406 --> 00:35:47.894
Rakki told me something before.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:50.940
That there was something
between Aries and Freya before.

00:35:51.162 --> 00:35:53.138
Maybe that's what Kiko meant?

00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:55.053
And now, Edrix too?

00:35:58.519 --> 00:35:59.520
Why?

00:36:00.146 --> 00:36:01.147
Nothing.

00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:28.065
Food, food, food!

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.091
Children!

00:36:29.116 --> 00:36:30.693
You don't get to be picky!

00:36:30.718 --> 00:36:33.232
Nobody has the right!
Not one of you has contributed.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.035
Eat well.

00:36:35.313 --> 00:36:36.313
There we go!

00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:39.310
And you're mad?

00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:40.573
I got you, bro.

00:36:44.357 --> 00:36:45.358
Ci!

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.980
Come with me.

00:36:47.763 --> 00:36:49.443
By the way Jay,
how was your little errand?

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:50.966
How is Kiko?

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:52.576
You're too loud!

00:36:53.012 --> 00:36:54.221
So dramatic!

00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:55.926
What do you mean dramatic?
You're too loud.

00:36:56.675 --> 00:36:58.340
Really? Don't you
have any shame?

00:36:58.417 --> 00:37:00.337
You're checking up on the guy
you beat to a pulp!

00:37:01.674 --> 00:37:03.006
I'm just asking.

00:37:03.914 --> 00:37:06.167
He doesn't look so good.

00:37:06.986 --> 00:37:09.697
He's disabled and
he can't move well.

00:37:09.722 --> 00:37:10.723
He looks like this.

00:37:10.748 --> 00:37:11.821
Ahh.

00:37:13.547 --> 00:37:14.548
Too bad.

00:37:15.098 --> 00:37:16.433
What do you mean too bad? Dumbass!

00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:17.542
Ah! It hurts, Jay!

00:37:17.567 --> 00:37:18.746
It hurts!

00:37:19.555 --> 00:37:20.681
What are you talking about?

00:37:20.706 --> 00:37:22.413
- I'm not saying anything.
- You're crazy.

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:24.142
I'll report you to Keifer!

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.582
That's where you're good at,
report to Keifer—

00:37:26.607 --> 00:37:28.067
Keifer, Jay-jay is using profanity–

00:37:28.567 --> 00:37:29.735
Come here!

00:37:29.735 --> 00:37:30.735
Come here!

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.449
We'll go out!

00:37:32.474 --> 00:37:33.531
But it's hot!

00:37:33.556 --> 00:37:35.180
We'll go out, bye.

00:37:37.677 --> 00:37:39.303
Come here. You're being
way too loud since earlier!

00:37:39.328 --> 00:37:41.049
I didn't say anything
about going out.

00:37:41.074 --> 00:37:42.623
What are we
going to do outside?

00:37:42.623 --> 00:37:43.666
It's hot, Jay-jay!

00:37:43.842 --> 00:37:45.135
You're such a pain in the ass!

00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:47.503
Go let Section E hear it!

00:37:47.962 --> 00:37:49.422
You're gonna get me in trouble!

00:37:49.647 --> 00:37:51.607
You're annoying.
I'm still hungry.

00:37:51.632 --> 00:37:52.820
I am too.

00:37:53.259 --> 00:37:54.552
This is your fault!

00:37:55.052 --> 00:37:56.929
At least the cat is eating.

00:37:58.723 --> 00:37:59.515
It's cute!

00:37:59.515 --> 00:38:00.850
I just said that nobody
should hear about it.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.101
That's Josh!

00:38:02.393 --> 00:38:04.437
- Ah really?
- Yes! Really, really?

00:38:05.998 --> 00:38:06.998
Hey, Josh!

00:38:07.072 --> 00:38:08.072
Oh?

00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:09.792
The cat is so cute!

00:38:09.817 --> 00:38:11.152
What a miracle.

00:38:11.738 --> 00:38:13.029
You're giving away food...

00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:14.140
but to a cat.

00:38:14.828 --> 00:38:16.148
Nothing, I'm just not hungry yet.

00:38:16.616 --> 00:38:17.856
So I just gave my lunch to him.

00:38:18.185 --> 00:38:19.561
You should have
just given it to me, right?

00:38:19.722 --> 00:38:21.365
- Are you hungry too?
- Yes!

00:38:22.872 --> 00:38:24.932
Edy, come and eat.

00:38:24.957 --> 00:38:25.958
Hey, Ci-N!

00:38:26.584 --> 00:38:27.887
If I were you,
I wouldn't do that.

00:38:27.912 --> 00:38:29.288
Why? It's grumpy?

00:38:30.629 --> 00:38:32.340
You eat too much, Edy.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.591
Who are you calling Edy?

00:38:34.525 --> 00:38:35.526
The cat.

00:38:35.811 --> 00:38:37.587
Huh? That's not Edy.

00:38:37.636 --> 00:38:38.637
Who is he?

00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:40.341
Nothing. He doesn't have a name.

00:38:40.714 --> 00:38:41.714
Then he's Edy.

00:38:42.444 --> 00:38:43.987
Where did you get Edy from?

00:38:44.477 --> 00:38:45.478
His color.

00:38:46.273 --> 00:38:48.441
The one from
the battery commercial.

00:38:48.814 --> 00:38:50.900
- So Edy.
- Ah right!

00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:53.344
That's a black cat too!

00:38:53.652 --> 00:38:54.653
You're so smart!

00:38:54.678 --> 00:38:57.235
Your friends must be smart too.

00:38:57.406 --> 00:38:58.866
That's not Edy!

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.410
- Whatever.
- Where are you going?

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.771
- I'll get food for Edy.
- Oh, Jay!

00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:05.582
Why?

00:39:07.416 --> 00:39:08.876
You know them right?

00:39:09.622 --> 00:39:10.622
Huh?

00:39:11.194 --> 00:39:12.194
Who?

00:39:12.505 --> 00:39:15.758
The ones you saw on
the night of the festival.

00:39:22.856 --> 00:39:24.190
Ah…

00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:26.852
Oh?

00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:31.607
If there is something
between you and Keifer,

00:39:31.982 --> 00:39:35.528
promise me that you'll never
tell him about it.

00:39:36.217 --> 00:39:38.011
"Something between us," really?

00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:48.387
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:39:39.412 --> 00:39:41.414
But didn't I tell you,

00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:43.202
they are safe with Keifer.

00:39:43.494 --> 00:39:45.037
- Really?
- Yes!

00:39:45.958 --> 00:39:48.419
You know how Keifer is
when he's mad, right?

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:53.838
So while we still don't know
how Keifer will react...

00:39:54.296 --> 00:39:55.464
don't tell him just yet.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:59.468
In case it all works out fine.

00:40:01.929 --> 00:40:03.556
What are you trying to say?

00:40:06.016 --> 00:40:07.418
I'm friends with Mayo and Kit.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.732
I want them to be happy.

00:40:10.764 --> 00:40:12.784
But I'm thinking,

00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:16.560
maybe they'll stop hurting if

00:40:16.694 --> 00:40:18.529
they stop this madness.

00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:20.821
They're the ones suffering.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.842
They're just hurting even more

00:40:22.867 --> 00:40:25.077
because they
can't defend themselves.

00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:27.705
You know what, you're right,

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.874
That got me thinking.

00:40:30.198 --> 00:40:31.575
Hello Edy!

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.961
This is for you.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.601
Is that why you're quiet,
because you think like that?

00:40:36.797 --> 00:40:38.132
How did you even notice that?

00:40:38.157 --> 00:40:39.783
I should do that too.

00:40:40.443 --> 00:40:41.694
So I can think clearly.

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:44.263
There! He feels shy.

00:40:49.226 --> 00:40:50.686
Jay, it bit me!

00:40:51.046 --> 00:40:53.214
It's your fault, you brat!

00:40:53.361 --> 00:40:54.597
There, you got yourself in trouble again!

00:40:55.683 --> 00:40:58.302
Jay-jay, I might die.
He might have rabies!

00:40:58.903 --> 00:40:59.904
It's your fault, Josh!

00:40:59.904 --> 00:41:01.030
Come here, I'll check.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.157
Get vaccinated right away,
come on, let's go see!

00:41:03.182 --> 00:41:04.925
Jay-jay, I don't want
to get injected!

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.994
You're so dramatic,
you can't do anything about it!

00:41:06.994 --> 00:41:08.162
Go get injected, go home!

00:41:08.187 --> 00:41:09.317
They'll cut that off,

00:41:09.351 --> 00:41:10.644
you're such a handful!

00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:14.658
The bite still hurts, Jay.

00:41:15.002 --> 00:41:16.082
The injection hurts too bad.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.151
Poor brat, can I see?

00:41:22.176 --> 00:41:23.594
Look, it bit me.

00:41:23.594 --> 00:41:25.763
- Give it to me, I'll massage it.
- It hurts.

00:41:25.763 --> 00:41:27.973
There, so the pain will go away.

00:41:28.557 --> 00:41:30.851
- Like that.
- Thanks, Jay.

00:41:30.876 --> 00:41:31.877
Is it okay now?

00:41:33.437 --> 00:41:34.939
You're too attached to Jay-jay.

00:41:34.964 --> 00:41:36.340
That's too much.

00:41:42.052 --> 00:41:44.028
I think he's feeling jealous again.

00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:54.833
And this other one too.

00:41:55.334 --> 00:41:57.044
What do I do?

00:41:57.503 --> 00:41:59.380
Are they jealous of Ci-N?

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:01.757
Are you and Yuri a thing?

00:42:03.173 --> 00:42:04.173
Huh?

00:42:04.198 --> 00:42:05.210
No!

00:42:05.408 --> 00:42:07.952
Yeah! Why is he
acting like you are?

00:42:08.073 --> 00:42:09.324
Like he owns you.

00:42:10.015 --> 00:42:12.309
Jay, don't say yes
if he courts you.

00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:15.203
- Maybe—
- It's like you don't know Yuri.

00:42:15.467 --> 00:42:17.147
He was the exact same
way with Ella before.

00:42:18.228 --> 00:42:19.228
Oh, yeah.

00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:22.403
Yes...

00:42:25.896 --> 00:42:27.230
I'll just pee, okay?

00:42:34.248 --> 00:42:35.249
Hey, Kit!

00:42:35.916 --> 00:42:36.917
It's lunch break, right?

00:42:36.942 --> 00:42:38.152
Why are you not eating?

00:42:38.419 --> 00:42:39.712
What are you doing here?

00:42:40.838 --> 00:42:41.838
Nothing.

00:42:42.548 --> 00:42:43.966
I just want to be alone.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.386
Me too.

00:42:52.308 --> 00:42:55.185
How are you and Mayo?

00:42:57.479 --> 00:42:58.480
Mayo?

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.941
I don't know.

00:43:01.692 --> 00:43:03.718
He keeps on pestering me but
I don't want it anymore, Jay.

00:43:04.778 --> 00:43:05.851
Are you sure?

00:43:07.364 --> 00:43:08.949
But that's not what you chose.

00:43:09.612 --> 00:43:11.197
That's truly how you feel, right?

00:43:11.496 --> 00:43:13.373
So, how are you
going to put a stop to it?

00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:15.942
That's the thing,

00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:20.309
I wish I was given choices
on how to feel.

00:43:20.753 --> 00:43:21.753
But there's none.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.297
The choice given to me was,

00:43:24.256 --> 00:43:26.717
to choose between my family, or him.

00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:28.482
How?

00:43:32.598 --> 00:43:34.266
I want to make this right.

00:43:35.267 --> 00:43:37.394
I want to fix
whatever's wrong with me.

00:43:38.562 --> 00:43:41.190
Wait a minute, there is
nothing wrong with you.

00:43:41.973 --> 00:43:44.943
You don't need to be fixed
because you are not broken.

00:43:46.195 --> 00:43:47.821
It's easy for you to say,

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:50.908
because you're not in my place.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.914
That's okay, I understand.

00:43:58.749 --> 00:44:00.459
You don't understand, Jay.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.545
Because you're not in a situation
where you have to choose

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.489
between family, or feelings.

00:44:06.548 --> 00:44:07.675
You don't understand.

00:44:16.433 --> 00:44:18.143
Should I continue
what I did before?

00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:20.312
Huh?

00:44:20.337 --> 00:44:23.257
It might be effective
and make a man out of me.

00:44:24.678 --> 00:44:26.764
You just held my hand before.

00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:30.489
Maybe...

00:44:39.915 --> 00:44:41.667
Try planting a kiss on me—

00:44:42.251 --> 00:44:43.377
See?

00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:45.170
You're cross-eyed!

00:44:45.786 --> 00:44:47.678
- You look stupid!
- You're too much!

00:44:47.968 --> 00:44:49.798
Your finger got me dizzy!

00:44:51.813 --> 00:44:54.899
You're so stupid!
I told you to get your head straight.

00:44:54.939 --> 00:44:56.524
Son of a bitch, is it Jay-jay?

00:44:57.512 --> 00:44:58.555
Is she the reason?

00:44:58.642 --> 00:44:59.643
Mayo?

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.281
Wait no!

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:03.522
You've misunderstood, it's Kit's fault!

00:45:03.522 --> 00:45:05.399
Come here and explain yourself!

00:45:05.424 --> 00:45:06.842
Come closer, quick.

00:45:07.276 --> 00:45:08.485
Why did you agree?

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.012
You must have liked it too!

00:45:10.362 --> 00:45:11.947
You have Keifer and Yuri,

00:45:11.947 --> 00:45:13.157
and now you want Kit too!

00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:15.200
Don't talk to Jay-jay like that!

00:45:15.235 --> 00:45:16.736
He kissed you

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.162
...and you let him do it!

00:45:21.206 --> 00:45:22.291
Fuck you!

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.127
Asshole, I didn't let him kiss me!

00:45:25.127 --> 00:45:27.212
He was just joking about it,
it didn't happen!

00:45:27.237 --> 00:45:28.237
I didn't let him kiss me!

00:45:28.262 --> 00:45:30.342
- You're such a dimwit!
- Hey, what's happening here?

00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:33.635
Who tried to kiss you Jay?

00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:34.807
No one!

00:45:34.926 --> 00:45:37.345
You heard it wrong,
nothing happened!

00:45:37.789 --> 00:45:38.790
I don't think so.

00:45:39.081 --> 00:45:40.082
You did it again!

00:45:40.377 --> 00:45:41.587
Does Keifer know about this?

00:45:42.352 --> 00:45:44.855
Edrix please, don't tell him.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.206
It's Mayo's fault!

00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:48.400
Calm down first,
calm down.

00:45:48.862 --> 00:45:50.489
Can you mind your own business?

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.187
We're talking!

00:45:52.696 --> 00:45:54.490
What the fuck
is your problem bro, huh?

00:45:54.673 --> 00:45:56.133
Don't point your finger at Jay-jay!

00:45:56.158 --> 00:45:58.202
Wait, all of you stop!

00:45:58.535 --> 00:46:01.371
What? Did you fall
victim to this girl, too?

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.041
Nice, Jay!

00:46:03.582 --> 00:46:07.002
Go! Flirt with
the whole Section E!

00:46:07.252 --> 00:46:09.379
After all, you're no
different from Ella!

00:46:10.506 --> 00:46:12.048
Son of a bitch!
What did you say?

00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:30.108
Hey, Jay!

00:46:30.692 --> 00:46:32.069
What did the clinic say?

00:46:32.319 --> 00:46:33.320
How's Mayo?

00:46:34.404 --> 00:46:36.198
The nurse is taking care of him.

00:46:36.374 --> 00:46:37.709
He will come out in a bit.

00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:39.344
That punch was child's play.

00:46:40.327 --> 00:46:41.453
Come on, Jay.

00:46:41.703 --> 00:46:43.121
You punch like a dude!

00:46:43.664 --> 00:46:45.207
It's even stronger than Kit's!

00:46:45.916 --> 00:46:47.167
- No.
- That's too much.

00:46:47.192 --> 00:46:48.279
- How, how?
- Here!

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.980
Like that!

00:46:50.005 --> 00:46:51.423
No, his face is just too soft to handle it.

00:46:51.448 --> 00:46:52.616
You're something else, wow.

00:47:03.048 --> 00:47:04.048
Hey.

00:47:04.186 --> 00:47:05.437
What happened to you?

00:47:09.106 --> 00:47:10.858
She has a new boyfriend again.

00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:13.318
Oh, yeah.

00:47:13.318 --> 00:47:14.736
And they're kissing already.

00:47:18.782 --> 00:47:20.784
Have you tried approaching her?

00:47:21.577 --> 00:47:22.578
I can't!

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.080
She hates Section E, remember?

00:47:26.206 --> 00:47:27.207
Oh, right.

00:47:28.017 --> 00:47:31.850
And it looks like she hates
you guys more, now that I'm here.

00:47:32.004 --> 00:47:33.318
When I butt heads with her.

00:47:33.939 --> 00:47:35.190
She's just so dramatic!

00:47:35.215 --> 00:47:36.633
It's like she's
always on her period.

00:47:36.658 --> 00:47:37.743
She's always mad.

00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:40.178
If she becomes your girlfriend,
teach her a lesson.

00:47:40.762 --> 00:47:41.765
Of course!

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:42.848
What are you talking about!

00:47:42.848 --> 00:47:43.932
- That's my crush!
- Jay.

00:47:44.619 --> 00:47:45.619
Edrix!

00:47:47.477 --> 00:47:48.562
Sorry, Jay.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.189
I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

00:47:54.926 --> 00:47:56.177
You're different from Ella.

00:47:56.653 --> 00:47:57.779
You are not the same.

00:47:59.823 --> 00:48:02.034
I'm sorry if I punched you.

00:48:02.284 --> 00:48:03.660
You won't listen!

00:48:04.912 --> 00:48:05.913
Sit down.

00:48:12.044 --> 00:48:13.503
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts.

00:48:13.563 --> 00:48:14.564
Sorry.

00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:23.820
Ah Edrix, why are you sad?

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.558
What were you talking
about a while ago?

00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:27.935
A girl.

00:48:29.311 --> 00:48:31.188
Oh? Edrix's girl?

00:48:31.188 --> 00:48:32.898
It really is your girl!

00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:34.232
You have a girlfriend?

00:48:34.257 --> 00:48:35.317
No!

00:48:35.342 --> 00:48:38.679
Not yet, he's still
dreaming about it.

00:48:40.702 --> 00:48:42.913
Did you tell her how you feel?

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.137
I don't even know
if she notices me,

00:48:47.162 --> 00:48:49.831
or if she even knows I exist.

00:48:50.207 --> 00:48:51.708
You have it good, actually.

00:48:52.167 --> 00:48:54.002
In my case,

00:48:55.153 --> 00:48:56.959
he knows I love him,

00:48:58.215 --> 00:48:59.800
but he's avoiding me.

00:49:02.452 --> 00:49:03.996
You know, you guys are right.

00:49:04.754 --> 00:49:06.589
Falling in love is so hard, right?

00:49:07.766 --> 00:49:09.184
What do you mean it's hard?

00:49:09.434 --> 00:49:11.395
There are two guys
chasing after you.

00:49:11.645 --> 00:49:13.981
That's right!
You have Yuri and Keifer.

00:49:14.014 --> 00:49:15.065
What?

00:49:15.065 --> 00:49:15.941
- Yeah.
- Wait!

00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:17.484
You guys sure know how to talk me up!

00:49:17.484 --> 00:49:19.236
Like I'm so gorgeous!

00:49:19.236 --> 00:49:20.821
Isn't it true, though?

00:49:20.821 --> 00:49:22.155
No, stop it.

00:49:22.155 --> 00:49:23.365
You talk too much!

00:49:23.365 --> 00:49:26.535
I just meddled in your drama
and suddenly it's all about me!

00:49:26.535 --> 00:49:27.744
But honestly,

00:49:27.744 --> 00:49:29.454
you don't like either of them?

00:49:34.001 --> 00:49:36.753
If I were you, I'd pick Yuri.

00:49:36.753 --> 00:49:38.005
Why Yuri?

00:49:38.296 --> 00:49:39.881
Keifer ain't shit.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.885
The problem with him is that
he's selfish when it comes to girls.

00:49:44.194 --> 00:49:47.280
So, despite Yuri being
his only remaining friend,

00:49:47.305 --> 00:49:48.765
he still stole his girl.

00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:50.555
What do you mean?

00:49:51.243 --> 00:49:53.537
Who would Keifer
steal from Yuri?

00:49:53.562 --> 00:49:54.896
Who else? Ella!

00:49:55.439 --> 00:49:57.649
She wanted to choose Yuri.

00:49:58.108 --> 00:50:01.820
But Keifer stole her away,
so she ended up with him.

00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:05.815
What do you mean
it was supposed to be Yuri?

00:50:06.074 --> 00:50:07.102
I don't know.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.940
Well, that was what Ella said,

00:50:09.871 --> 00:50:11.456
that she wanted to choose Yuri.

00:50:17.455 --> 00:50:18.490
Ah right...

00:50:18.587 --> 00:50:19.713
By the way,

00:50:20.374 --> 00:50:23.544
is Josh really that weird?

00:50:24.134 --> 00:50:25.708
Has he always been this quiet?

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:26.969
No.

00:50:27.382 --> 00:50:29.175
His girlfriend died.

00:50:29.598 --> 00:50:35.145
Since then, he became
quiet and a bit weird.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.563
Really?

00:50:36.757 --> 00:50:38.030
Poor him.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.200
Let's go back to what we
were talking about earlier!

00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:45.547
Answer it, Jay!

00:50:45.572 --> 00:50:47.115
You are so annoying,
I already changed the topic!

00:50:47.115 --> 00:50:47.824
It's your fault!

00:50:47.824 --> 00:50:49.409
- That's right!
- Who do you really want?

00:50:49.409 --> 00:50:50.786
- Who?
- Yuri.

00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:52.471
Let's look at Freya!

00:50:52.496 --> 00:50:53.914
She might have a new photo.

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:54.939
Not Freya!

00:50:57.491 --> 00:50:59.534
You cut class just
so you could talk here?

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:01.872
What are you talking about?

00:51:05.425 --> 00:51:06.426
Drix.

00:51:09.846 --> 00:51:10.847
'Sup, Keifer?

00:51:11.223 --> 00:51:12.224
How you doing?

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.643
I'm stressed, how's you?

00:51:15.828 --> 00:51:18.917
No matter what self defense I use,

00:51:19.746 --> 00:51:21.952
someone is still bound to get hurt.

00:51:26.053 --> 00:51:27.388
I just wanna show her.

00:51:29.442 --> 00:51:30.442
Man.

00:51:30.931 --> 00:51:32.641
Keifer ain't shit.

00:51:33.161 --> 00:51:36.957
The problem is, he's selfish
when it comes to girls.

00:51:37.224 --> 00:51:40.477
So, despite Yuri being
his only remaining friend,

00:51:40.502 --> 00:51:41.795
he still stole away his girl.

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:46.970
Yuri is a coward.

00:51:47.747 --> 00:51:49.624
That's why he is
always clinging to Keifer,

00:51:49.783 --> 00:51:51.903
because he's too scared of
making an enemy out of him.

00:51:52.835 --> 00:51:54.587
Jay, he doesn't fight fair.

00:51:55.422 --> 00:51:57.591
He makes moves without us knowing.

00:52:47.817 --> 00:52:49.988
Hey, Jay-jay!
Let's get Yogorino, please!

00:52:49.988 --> 00:52:53.366
I've been craving this
whole time, Jay please.

00:52:53.366 --> 00:52:55.785
Do you think the rabies
has reached your brain?

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.187
You're taking
too long to choose.

00:52:57.721 --> 00:52:58.722
David.

00:52:58.747 --> 00:53:01.082
Who asked you
to give me this necklace?

00:53:01.107 --> 00:53:02.776
Do you know
any child of Poseidon?

00:53:04.502 --> 00:53:06.254
Just get back here
as soon as you can.

00:53:06.671 --> 00:53:07.672
Okay.

00:53:08.715 --> 00:53:09.716
Is that mine?

00:53:10.508 --> 00:53:12.969
Thanks anyways but
it would be a waste.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.994
I crave a different kind
of sweet now.

00:53:15.263 --> 00:53:16.847
- What?
- Your lips.

00:53:18.975 --> 00:53:20.644
Are we going
to attend mass here?

00:53:22.604 --> 00:53:23.730
So ugly.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.375
I'll teach you
new Japanese words.

00:53:26.441 --> 00:53:27.609
What is it? I can do that.

00:53:28.151 --> 00:53:29.361
Say...

00:53:29.386 --> 00:53:31.972
[in Japanese] I love you.

00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:34.216
Why are you
doing this to me, Jay?

00:53:34.241 --> 00:53:35.492
Do you like Yuri?

00:53:35.492 --> 00:53:36.628
Fine!

00:53:36.927 --> 00:53:40.347
I don't know how I feel
but I'm doing what is right!

00:53:40.372 --> 00:53:41.945
It's supposed to be Yuri.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:44.181
Because of that engagement?

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.152
It's the right thing to do, Keifer.
