00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:11.537
(Months earlier. The day
of Shen Changning's grand wedding)

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:17.537
(Shen Changning and Xi Yan
meet for the first time)

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.039
Young Lady.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.290
Please, do not look anymore.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.920
Today is your big day of joy,

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.039
yet we encounter a funeral procession.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.320
It is far too inauspicious.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.880
The deceased hold high respect.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.359
Let us give way.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.359
Help me.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.840
Let me out.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.480
Stop.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.760
There are clearly sounds
coming from inside.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760
Let me out.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:24.359
Why do you turn a deaf ear?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.480
Could it be
there is a living person inside?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.840
You are mistaken, Young Lady.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.560
Do you think

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.040
the dead can rise again?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.879
Step aside quickly.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.490
Do not let this interfere
with your wedding's good fortune.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:38.519
You...

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.159
Thank you for saving me, Young Lady.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.560
I will surely repay
your kindness one day.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.990
The coffin bearers confessed
they were acting on someone's orders.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.599
Do you not want to pursue

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.520
the person who tried to bury you alive?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.360
I am just a weak woman,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.319
with a wretched life.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.400
I will accept my fate.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.560
Accept your fate?

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:20.517
He wounded one of your eyes,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.159
you should blind both of his.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.199
He trapped you in a coffin,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.280
you should bury him underground instead!

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Young Lady Shen,

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.120
you are capable of that,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.800
but I am not.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.980
Life and death, good fortune and ill
are all destined by Heaven.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.919
Xi Yan,

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.080
you must live well.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:52.639
If someone wishes you dead,

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.479
you must strive even harder to live.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.919
Who says life and death
are determined by providence?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.400
We shall defy heaven
and seize our own fate.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.120
(I rescued Xi Yan by chance that day.)

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.280
(From then on, the destinies of us)

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.500
(became closely intertwined.)

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.880
(Since Pei Yu has already
become suspicious of my identity,)

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.759
(I shall stage a performance for him.)

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:04.050

=Episode 6=
(the more suspicious she seems)

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.000
Shen Changning.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.240
I have fulfilled your request,

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.199
and found your maid, Lian.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.000
Do not trouble my dreams anymore.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.879
What is your connection
to the Shen family's eldest daughter?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.279
She...

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.639
She is my life-saver.

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:49.639
If it were not for her,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.439
I would have already become a corpse.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.120
So, since she died,

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.199
I must live on for her.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.720
As long as there is still someone
from the Shen family,

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:04.040
I must find them for her.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.790
When did the Shen family's
eldest daughter save you?

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.120
Drink.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:18.992
If you drink, I will tell you.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.160
Drink...

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.990
Could Xi Yan truly have
a past connection with Young Lady Shen?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.279
She could have said this at any time,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.220
yet she chose to say it precisely
when I suspected her.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.780
The more she explains,
the more suspicious she becomes.

00:05:43.862 --> 00:05:45.063
She protests too much.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.199
But the coroner has already confirmed

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:52.360
that Young Lady Shen is indeed deceased.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.120
It seems this Xi Yan

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.720
is deeply involved with the Shen family.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.399
Young Lady.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.519
Pei Yu has left.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.862
I checked carefully,

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:04.959
there are no spies around.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.680
I wonder if my words just now

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.879
managed to fool him.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.759
I saw him escort you back to your room,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.600
but there was no expression on his face.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.240
I cannot tell.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.959
Young Lady,

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.360
if I did not fool him,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.399
what shall we do?

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.639
I am Shen Changning.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:58.680
I am not dead.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.279
So, since she died,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.160
I must live on for her.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.600
As long as there is still someone
from the Shen family,

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.720
I must find them for her.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.360
I shall assist Your Lordship
with his bath.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.480
What is the meaning of this?

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.600
When Xiao Huaijin previously
entered the Residence,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.000
he threatened me,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.590
wanting me to assassinate the Governor.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.080
If that is the case,

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.279
why did you not comply?

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.360
I naturally knows

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:46.799
who the truly reliable person is.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.879
Other than this dagger you carry,

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.960
do you have any other weapons?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.279
Are you intending

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.840
to switch your allegiance,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.320

your only outcome

to infiltrate
another person's residence.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.679
Unexpectedly, she was persecuted
by villains midway,

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:36.620
and nearly lost her life.

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:37.960

the grace of a new beginning.

was Lian?

And what is more,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.799
that Lian

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.200
kept calling that
lowly servant "Young Lady".

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.080
Impossible!

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:06.360
How could this lowly servant
be kind enough to take in Lian?

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.519
could Xi Yan perhaps be...

Impossible!

Shen Changning is dead.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.879
I saw her body with my own eyes.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:23.440
What I mean

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.240
is could her resentment be too strong,

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:28.039
and her spirit possess another body?

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.080
No matter how,
