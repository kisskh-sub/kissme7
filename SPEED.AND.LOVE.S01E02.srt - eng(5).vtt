[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.850
[Episode 2]

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.280
This is for you.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.280
When I come back,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.870
I'll check how your handwriting's

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.500
coming along.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580
Keep practicing your handwriting.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.880
And don't be picky with your food.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.890
Zhao.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.520
Will you come back to see me?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.410
Will you always think of me?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.410
I will.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.180
As long as you don't change,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.350
I won't change either.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.510
Zhao, it's been so long since you called.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
I don't know how to reach you,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.500
so I can only try to write to you.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.900
I hope you'll receive this.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.980
Mom and I are moving.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.790
Once I know where we're going,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.340
I'll write to you again.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.620
Miss you. Mu.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.810
Zhao,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.160
Mom and I
have finally moved into our new house.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.230
I really wish you could come back.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.170
I'll be starting middle school next year.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.900
I'll have lots of homework
and tutoring classes.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.530
If I do well on my exams,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.390
will you come back to see me

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.720
during the summer break after graduation?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.230
Miss you. Mu.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.190
Zhao,

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.130
this is the last time I'm writing to you,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.070
because you never wrote me back,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.340
and I feel like
I've been writing to the air.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.990
I'm starting middle school soon.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.910
I'll have many new classmates,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.570
and I'll make more friends.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.300
So,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.940
that's it.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.460
I won't miss you anymore. Mu.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.020
I won't be at the shop tomorrow.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.460
If it's urgent, ask Yang.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.530
Yes.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740
I must go there tomorrow afternoon.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.380
I know what I'm doing.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.820
Alright, don't worry.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.420
I'm hanging up.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.640
Where are you sleeping tonight?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.500
You go to sleep. I'll leave later.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.600
Do you have somewhere to stay?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.100
Mind your own business.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.130
Goodbye.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.950
Wait, Yang, are you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.190
grilling skewers just to avoid drinking?

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.950
No. The fire's a bit too strong.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.210
-I have to watch it.
-Don't burn it.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.180
[Wan Qing]

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.810
I'll make it up to you later.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.730
Something's going on tonight, huh?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.810
Your phone's been busy.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.330
A new girlfriend?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.660
Just drink.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.570
Drink while you can!

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.770
See? That's why I said

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.370
Jin, you're still the worst.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.710
Eat up. I've got more here.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.030
Come on.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.430
Come on.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.940
Cheers.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.420
Come on, let's drink.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.330
You beat him up.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.440
That's not fair, Brother.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.860
We didn't lay a finger on him.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.540
He accidentally tripped

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.690
He bumped and fell.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.490
Is that so?

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.940
I've brought the money.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.660
I'm taking him with me.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.190
Why didn't you answer my calls?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.760
I'll bring the rest another day.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.370
I called you over a dozen times,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.659
and you didn't pick up once.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.100
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.230
Don't play such childish games again.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.940
I hired the best chef from Diya City

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.130
and spent 5 hours on makeup and hair.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.300
Even for my father's second wedding,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.159
I didn't put this much effort
into dressing.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.480
You're leaving without even taking a look?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.880
You're not allowed to go.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.159
I took a look.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.330
Can I go now?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.320
Jin Zhao,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.140
how about this?

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.440
Stay and have dinner with me,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.060
and I'll write off all of Jin Qiang's

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.940
gambling debt.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.830
What do you say?

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.150
Just one meal?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.680
Stay with me

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.080
after dinner.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.160
And what exactly would I be staying for?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.170
For...

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.860
Are you asleep?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.350
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.530
You're abandoning your father?

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.390
He's yours now.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.130
It's late.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.200
Go to sleep now.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.080
Will you come back tomorrow?

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.350
You took the gift?

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:41.940
Did you open it?

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.450
You're up?

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.110
Why are you spacing out? Come here.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.400
I made you something to eat.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.200
Have some food before you go out.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.170
Mrs. Zhao,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.290
do you know where Jin Zhao went?

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.150
Do you need him for something?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.660
I'm just asking.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.850
He's busy outside.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.970
He usually doesn't come home?

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.070
There's nothing going on at home.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.210
Why would he come back?

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:06.810
Hurry.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.070
I'll go take a shower first.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.850
There's nothing going on at home.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.110
Why would he come back?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.880
Mrs. Zhao,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.800
the water heater is broken.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:25.510
What's wrong?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.090
This...

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.210
What's happening? The water...

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.760
How did the water heater

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.010
suddenly break?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.370
I can't fix this.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.950
How did this happen?

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.550
Don't panic.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120
Where are you?

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.490
The pipe on the water heater at home
fell off.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.950
Hurry back and take a look.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.140
If the water floods downstairs,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.040
they'll come up and give us trouble.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.490
I don't know how to fix it.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.180
Mrs. Zhao.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.540
Why don't we

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.020
ask Jin Zhao to fix it?

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.780
What are you looking at?

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.420
The sun.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.450
Looking at the sun in the bathroom?

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Did you fix it?

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.170
Xin,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.720
what are you doing?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.840
Looking at the sun too?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.560
Go back to your room.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.770
How is it?

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.360
The water has stopped,

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.620
but the pipe is broken.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.940
What should we do?

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.600
The water heater is too old.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.240
It's hard to find a replacement pipe.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.570
Let's just get a new one.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.180
Why spend money on that?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.920
Find a way to reconnect it.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.030
As long as it works.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.380
I'll order a new one.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.330
Sanlai will come to install it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.530
Don't worry about it.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.570
Xin, why are you standing here?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.300
Come on.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.050
Go mind your own business.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.850
Come quickly.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.270
Well, when can I take a shower?

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.380
Once it's installed.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.870
When will it be installed?

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.090
Sanlai will come to install it soon.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.660
Someone else is going to install it?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.520
What about you?

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.370
I have something to do.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.160
What is it?

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.090
Why do you have so many questions?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.440
Hello. Hello.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.000
Go, follow him.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:48.790
Get in!

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.450
Thank you.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.020
Hello. How can I help you?

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.650
This one. This one. I want this.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.530
Please wait at platform 1.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.610
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.760
Why are you following me?

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.910
What a coincidence. You're here too.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.380
I'm shopping around here.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.620
Weren't you going shopping?

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.720
The internet says there's an event
on Thursday

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.900
with lots of handsome guys.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.430
It's only Wednesday today.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.890
What do you think of this banana?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.040
It looks sweet.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.920
Do you need a fruit knife to eat a banana?

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.090
Didn't you just buy it from the store?

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.210
I'm planning to

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.630
buy a watermelon later.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.290
Bananas and watermelons are both good.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.520
Buy yourself something to eat and drink.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.580
Stop following me.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.780
I'll tell you one more time—

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.840
stop following me.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.580
Hello.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.080
Here, please.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.160
300.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.130
100.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.610
200.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.400
-100, please.
-No, no, no.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.850
-200, 200.
-100.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.360
Stop here.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.400
Scamming people for money again, huh?

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.520
Aren't you Brandy's sister?

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.720
What are you doing here?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.850
Where are you going?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.370
Jin Zhao and I made an appointment.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.830
I'm just going to find him.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.470
Now?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.450
He really allowed you to go?

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.140
Yes.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.700
Jin,
did you make an appointment with him too?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.160
I was just about to go.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.560
Perfect. Let's go together.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.349
I was going to take a cab,

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.099
but I didn't bring enough cash.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.880
He really said you could come?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.490
Look, we're running out of time.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.369
You brought enough cash, right?

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.369
I'll get on first.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.480
To Peita.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.760
Quick! Don't stop!

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.970
Beat him!

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.380
Good!
Don't give him a chance to fight back!

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.440
Don't give him a chance to fight back!

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.050
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Count! Count! Count!

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.320
Five!

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:13.510
Four!

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.970
Three!

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.220
Two!

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.380
One!

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.490
Uncle,

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.980
you were right. We won!

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.040
That was just the appetizer.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.930
The real show hasn't started yet.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.450
In the next match,

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.340
He Zhang

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.610
will give Brandy a beating!

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.630
Who's his opponent?

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.580
Someone works for Wan Shengbang.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.530
His name is He Zhang,

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.990
and he seems pretty tough.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.620
Yes, tough.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.250
I've seen him fight.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.050
He won't lose.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.310
Don't miss the mountain roads
in Qingshi.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.850
You'll still have to

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.920
keep playing along with Wan's.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.410
Sorry to put you through this match.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.070
Be careful.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.010
Try not to hurt

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.300
your hands or legs.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.690
I know what I'm doing.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.900
Ready to take a beating?

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.920
Lin Sui raised the bet.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.510
Wan's raised the bet.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.860
Dad, how could you raise the bet?

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.800
What if something goes wrong?

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.860
Qing,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.210
are you worried about He Zhang

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.640
or about Brandy?

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.170
You just love stirring up trouble,
don't you?

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.170
If you don't want to watch, get lost.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.050
He Zhang.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.310
If you dare hurt him,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.510
you're dead.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.320
You care about him that much?

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.500
He's my man.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.440
Go home!

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.020
Don't disappoint me.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.490
Bite down on your mouthguard.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.660
Okay, hands.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.280
No jewelry or hard objects allowed.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.880
Good. Now show me your hands.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.000
Listen to me.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.630
No strikes to the back of the head
or the spine.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.460
Fight!

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.330
Not bad, Zhang!

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.820
Beat him! Remember!

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:55.730
Get up, He Zhang!

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.610
Sorry to put you through this match.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.120
You'll still have to keep playing along

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.390
with Wan's.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.100
Come on!

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.610
Stop, stop.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.860
Who is she?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.550
She's with Brandy.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.270
Come on, who is she?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.200
She has wine.
Please.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.670
Do me a favor.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.450
Okay.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.240
Let's go.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.690
Brandy is Jin Zhao?

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.030
Why do you all call him Brandy?

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.500
Isn't there a Chinese saying?

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.810
"Drink while you can?"

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:35.720
Smart.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.340
They only let familiar faces in;

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.940
strangers can't get inside.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.530
Stop, stop, stop.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.530
Okay, okay, okay.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.810
Where is Jin Zhao?

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.060
In the ring.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.200
Let's go, sis.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.660
Don't let him see you.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.920
He'll get distracted.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.860
Make way, please.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:31.560
Okay.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.340
Brandy.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.900
Take him down!

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.970
What?

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.970
Lin bet on Brandy,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.730
and Wan bet on He Zhang?

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.600
Who are they?

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.820
That guy in red over there

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:54.860
is Lin.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.550
He's the owner of this place

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.950
and the banker for today.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.360
That old man sitting across

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.340
is the owner of Wan's Auto Shop—

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.640
half the garages here belong to him.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.590
The blond guy

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.580
is the local boxing champion.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.860
Ten times the stakes.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.340
That's insane!

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.100
Is he trying to kill Brandy?

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.970
Well...

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.270
can't we just call it off?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.000
Let's get Jin Zhao out of here.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.810
Of course not, sis.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.820
Everyone here has already placed bets.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.610
Once you're in the ring,
your fate is in the hands of heaven.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.260
What about the money?
Are you going to pay it back?

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.100
I'll pay.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.670
I have money.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.530
There's money in my bank account.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.530
If I pay, can the fight be called off?

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.720
Jin.
Hit him!

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.940
Jin Zhao!

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.300
Beat him!

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:24.700
Stop! Stop!

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.430
Get up, Brandy! Bro!

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.470
Jin Zhao!

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.770
Count the seconds, ref! Count the seconds!

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:49.690
Jin Zhao!

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.620
Get up! Get up!

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.010
Jin Zhao!

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.020
Eight!

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.490
Seven!

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.860
Six!

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.180
Five!

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.690
Four!

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.010
Three!

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.210
Two!

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.630
One!

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.220
Sis!

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.050
Are you okay?

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.170
Okay?

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.260
Fight!

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.900
Zhao!

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:07.680

No, she didn't.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.310
You misheard, Miss.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:28.570
Be honest with me.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.950
Is she Jin Zhao's new girl?

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.000
How could that be possible?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.330
You know him.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.100
He's not interested in this.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.660
You idiot!

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.660
Moron!

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.630
I'm telling you.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.120
Tonight we must teach him a lesson!

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.070
How did you know about this place?

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.030
Who brought you in?

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.590
You're injured.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.730
Answer me first.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.120
How did you know about this place?

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.690
I got beaten.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.730
Why are you crying?

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.410
You weren't like this before.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.420
It's getting late.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.640
I'll take you back.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.030
Go home.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.690
It'll be fine once you're home.
I'll book your ticket.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.860
I'm not going back.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.890
Why not?

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.300
Now that you're here

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.760
and have seen everything,

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.990
what else is there to stay for?

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.140
Why did you become like this?

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.980
I heard everything Sanlai said to you

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.130
in the stairwell that day.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.170
He said you were going to do something
life-threatening.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.910
Do you think it's ridiculous?

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.080
Do you find it hard to understand

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.320
why I care so much about your affairs?

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.340
Maybe in your eyes,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.510
I'm just your childhood playmate,

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:09.850
Coming here this time

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.530
was just for fun.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.889
After the trip, I would leave

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.620
and have nothing to do with you.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.000
That's right.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.590
How could you understand?

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.900
If you could, you wouldn't have

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.520
