(Feng Haifeng, Deputy Director)

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.220
- Come in.
- Director, you need me?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.790
She knows now.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.480
He needs you.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.320
Why are you here?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.680
Why can't I be here?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.870
Oh, you came

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.590
for case files for lectures,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.710
right?

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.280
I'm here to report.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.430
Report?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.920
My file has been transferred back.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.350
You're my boss now.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.760
Xu Jingzhi, I'm the last one

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.350
to know your return?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.250
You should be the first to know.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.390
It's Director Feng's fault.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.340
It's surely his fault.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.510
He should've told you.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.640
It's okay; let me explain.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.650
There's a new place
for Hainanese chicken rice

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.800
at the mall near our home.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.310
Shouldn't you have told me

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.000
about your transfer
to my team in advance?

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.030
Such a big matter.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.000
How could I possibly notify you?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.840
Right?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.780
I have a new idea
about the wax figure case.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.430

Mr. Xu,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.030
what brings you here?

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.080
I am from the Police Academy
Class of 2005.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.920
My name is Liu Ming.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.570
I'm looking for Captain He.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.550
Captain He.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.750
Captain He, Mr. Xu is here.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.960
Let him sit

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.800
next to Li Long.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.990
Mr. Xu,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.230
this is your police seat.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.670
Let me know if you need anything.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.270
Thank you.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.270
Yin,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.640
did you use to work

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.520
with Mr. Xu?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.960
We were in the same special task force.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.280
Mr. Xu is so impressive.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.430
Why is Captain He so unhappy

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.750
about his arrival?

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.030
Of course.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.740
Who could possibly be happy

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.040
about working with an ex-husband?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.920
Don't pry into things
you shouldn't ask about.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.430
I was just asking.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.240
Tell me about their marriage.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.780
(Tea area)

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.190
I will behave.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.750
Is the ledger

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.750
with you?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I didn't expect you to look for me

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.470
just because of a few photos.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.950
So, the ledger is real.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.430
What do you mean?

I'm asking you where the ledger is.

(By Xu Jingzhi,
Examples of Criminal Psychology)

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.630
I can hand over the ledger.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.490
But I want to give it to your boss.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.040
Before that,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.920
you have to do me a favor first.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.320
How about it?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.950
You are not qualified to meet her.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.470
But the boss said we can help you

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.560
with the thing you want to do.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.110
Captain He,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080
new information.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.790
Let's go.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.800
Unit 1, a meeting.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.830
Let's summarize and discuss

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.780
what we've found so far.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.440
The trace inspection team
cut open the wax figure.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.870
Inside is a complete corpse.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.080
Male.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.240
The victim was aged

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.480
between 25 and 28 years old.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.970
There is another strange point.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.390
Burn marks were found

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.240
on the body.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.920
It is still unknown
how they were caused.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.180
In addition,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.580
we've found the tire purchase place

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.080
for the vehicle used to dump the body.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.180
We're tracking the vehicle.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.500
There are 13 studios that make

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.510
wax figures in the city.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.000
We've asked around with the photo.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.510
No discoveries so far.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.040
According to professionals,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.830
the materials used
by each wax figure maker

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.020
and their habitual proportions

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.860
are different.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.010
We asked all the studios

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.350
to provide their sample materials

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.370
for making wax figures.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.200
The Technical Department
is conducting tests.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.310
No matches have been found

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.510
for missing persons.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.640
The search has been expanded
to surrounding cities.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.770
At present, the biggest breakthrough

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.120
is the person who dumped the body.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.030
Keep searching.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.480
We must find this person.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.820
The others continue
with the investigation.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.750
Yes.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.690
There is one more thing.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.760

is all about telling everyone

that we should treat love with sincerity

(Zhou Hui,
Motor Vehicle Driver's License)

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.590
Captain He!

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.280
You want to run, huh?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.080
Ouch, ouch.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.920
Still running?

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.080
No, not running anymore.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.440
Who are you people?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.550
How dare you hit the police?

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.390
No, no.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.360
The knives she carefully designed

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600
are hanging on the wall.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.270
Illuminated by the light,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.640
the originally still grain
of the blade's surface

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.440
seemed to come alive.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.870
Entering the basement again,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.390
she regained control of that space.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.030
(The Eternal Lover)
Like the hug

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.910
she had never seen

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.960
and the kiss

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.630
she had never tried.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.320
She remembered those eyes.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.000
Stop!

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.850
Don't run!

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.800
Take a few more shots.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.550
Hurry up.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.390
Are you okay?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.630
Sorry.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.910
Due to this unexpected situation,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.960
the book club will end here.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.550
Please leave in an orderly manner.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.750
Sorry.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.200
- Thanks.
- Come on.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.840
Everyone, follow me and leave.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.920
Come on, this way.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.240
Sorry, sorry.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.120
Please follow me.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.320
Hello, Ms. Chen.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.610
Could you sign your name?

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.030
Sorry.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.390
She can't do that right now.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.040
Thank you.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.510
What do you think
about the fan's behavior just now?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.550
Everyone has their own way
of expressing themselves.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.790
Who are you?

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.160
We're police.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.480
We need to ask you something.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.720
Look at me right now.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.150
Can I change my clothes?

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.990
Of course.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.500
We'll wait for you at the café
on the first floor.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.920
Let's go.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.790
Do you think

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.220
you rinsed it quite clean with water?

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.600
Is washing a car illegal?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.650
Adjust your attitude.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.720
We're giving you a chance.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.560
Do you know?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.390
What else did you transport?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.120
Books, paper.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.600
What else could there be

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.010
in the publishing house's warehouse?

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.720
You could carry

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
160 jin

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.400
and transport it three times?

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.590
The animals at my farm
caught swine fever.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.340
I threw away a few.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.340
Fine me if you want.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.790
Do you know what's inside?

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.080
How is it?

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.320
Does it ring a bell?

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.110
Xu,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.440
you're so suited for the front line.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.750
Teaching is such a waste.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.200
A criminal police officer

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.390
should do more
than just arrest criminals.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.440
(Zhang Yutong: Don't worry. I'm fine.)

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.680
Chen,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.320
are you talking to someone?

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.320
Did she even take a shower?

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.510
Let's go.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.280
Mr. Xu,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.600
Lu Youliang's phone signal

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.440
has been moving,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.960
and it's near the book club.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.200
I understand, okay.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.040
Okay.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.060
(Lu Youliang)

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.590
Hello?

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.760
Alright, I got it.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.300
That's it then, bye-bye.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.190
We meet again.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.680
Yeah.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.780
Too coincidental to explain.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.950
You're interested in this too?

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.150
The book is good.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.110
Same hobbies

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.310
lead to the same circles.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.990
Thanks for the recommendation.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.910
You misunderstood.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.480
I am a fan of your books

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.830
and Ms. Chen's books.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.280
I appear here...

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.230
I love too many things, right?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.180
Observe widely but choose carefully.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.190
Pretty good.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.760
What does this mean?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.000
I grew up abroad.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.590
Just an idiom.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.830
If you have time, come to my restaurant.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.240
An acquaintance?

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.680
A book fan.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.000
Aren't you happy to meet a book fan?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.840
You look gloomy.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.110
When you have time,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.590
check him up.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.630
How's it going?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.270
How could I be so foolish?

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.200
He confessed something,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.510
but he wouldn't admit

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.550
that he met the murderer.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.550
For a bit of money, I...

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.800
How is that possible?

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.570
If he didn't meet the murderer,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.920
how did he get the body?

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.910
Officer,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.110
I admit

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.740
I dumped that wax figure.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.760
It's my fault.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.580
I'm willing to bear
all the consequences.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.720
I owed money to loan sharks.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.830
They threatened me with my daughter.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:56.670
I had no choice

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.310
but to do this.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.750
They came to me

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.950
because I often deliver goods

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.440
to a resort by the lake.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.650
The person looking for me

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.650
said he wanted me to dump a mannequin.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.200
There was money,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.030
so I agreed.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.020
(Wednesday, May 4, 2011)

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.720
I collected the money

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.560
through a locker.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.640
You can go check.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.680
It really wasn't me.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.110
They told me to go
to the nearest locker,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.920
saying it contained something I wanted.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.400
I...

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.280
I...

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.240
I was in desperate need of money.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.310
The payment from the publishing house

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.200
was not enough to repay the loan sharks.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.710
I just took the money
and dumped a wax figure.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.560
When I got to the riverside,
I pried it open

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.810
out of curiosity and discovered
there was a corpse.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.550
I didn't kill the person.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.510
I really didn't know it was a corpse.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.680
If I had known,

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.020
no matter how much money,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.180
even if you beat me to death,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.650
I still wouldn't have gone.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.310
For a bit of money,

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.830
how could I have been so foolish?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.590
I was foolish.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.720
How could I be so foolish?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.400
This photo is somewhat useful.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.240
He's not the murderer.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.540
What if he's pretending?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.680
He's just dumped the body.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.720
The real culprit is someone else.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.680
How arrogant.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.650
How's the investigation going?

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.200
The description in that novel

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.680
matches the disposed wax figure

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.520
almost exactly.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.400
Chen Danling

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.790
also staged

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.680
the blood scene

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.920
for publicity

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.830
at the book club.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.250
We've issued a warning

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.290
according to regulations.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.350
What about Chen Danling?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.240
We called her;

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.400
her nanny answered,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.790
saying she was frightened
and had a fever,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.760
so she needed rest.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.510
She can only speak to us tomorrow.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.030
If it's not Zhou Hui,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.480
then this novelist

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.440
is the most suspicious.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.650
When Chen Danling arrives tomorrow,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.120
you and Xu Jingzhi interrogate her.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.920
Shiqi, help me test

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.350
whether film burning can cause

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.350
burn marks on the body.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.270
She finally realized

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.640
that if her love was eternal,

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.750
then her lover must be immortal.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.070
Only by turning her lover

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.310
into a wax figure

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.310
could her love be eternal.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.240
He slept peacefully before her,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.790
with his chest
rising and falling calmly,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.550
moving the bright red

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.310
honeysuckle pattern on the collar.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.030
Those flowers

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.590
seemed to have come to life.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.240
She embroidered them for him.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.000
Captain He, Chen Danling's novel

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.070
has a strong pathological sense
of revenge.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.400
It is suggested to start with her

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.070
and her emotional relationships.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.480
Mr. Xu,

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.350
I finally waited for you to come.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.960
I made my best steak.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.070
I hope you like it.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.750
This kind of aged steak

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.720
should go

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.790
with a glass

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.350
of smoky Amarone.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.070
I'll just have plain water.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.190
Alright.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.810
You came today...

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.160
Thanks for recommending that book.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.220
(The Eternal Lover by Chen Danling)

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.880
You've followed me several times.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.400
It's not just to seek knowledge, is it?

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.070
How did you know

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.130
that the plot of the novel
was related to the case?

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.550
You've misunderstood.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.160
I saw the photos

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.110
online

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.110
and then realized the plot of the novel

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.200
was so similar to the case.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.650
At the time, I just wanted

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.640
to recommend the writer

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.510
I like to you.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.920
Another coincidence?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.640
I was startled when I saw it.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.070
But you had an alibi

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.720
that day.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.310
So, you've checked me.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.550
I was so scared

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.350
that you'd mistakenly think

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.510
I was connected to the case.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.140
(1 search result)

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.270
(Tang Shiqi)
Mr. Xu,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.780
I'll send you Zhuang Mingcheng's info.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.340
His parents are both overseas Chinese.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.680
He's not the man

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.720
in the photo you sent me.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.110
How does it taste?

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.310
You must have studied cooking

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.240
for quite some time, right?

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.590
Since I was a child,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.030
I've loved cooking.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.480
I'd always pester the family chef

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.320
to teach me.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.550
It's been over 20 years now.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.400
I want to learn, too.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.840
Can you teach me?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.830
Your expression

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.930
makes me feel like I have no hope.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.400
I'm just curious

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.650
about who you want to cook for

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.240
after you learn it.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.480
I'll use you to practice.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.070
I will come again.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.510
I'll surely come again.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.400
(Chen Danling's Fan Meeting)

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.700
(Maybe it's self-promotion.)

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.340
(A book club for this kind of book?)

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.340
(Zhi Fei)
Ms. Chen,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.880
your popularity online

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.910
is quite high now.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.920
You said you'd help me.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.100
The internet is full of voices
criticizing me.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.650
What use is this popularity to me?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.660
Don't mind those things.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.790
(Zhi Fei)
The reversal is about to come.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.270
Let me first wish
your new book great sales.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.500
(Zhi Fei)

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.240
You've done very well before.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.680
Your talent is about

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.310
to be seen by people all over the world.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.740
You are the most insightful author

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.160
about human nature I have ever met.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.940
(Wuyang Police)

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.790
Liu,

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.870
coffee.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.590
Thank you, Yin.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.630
Captain He.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.760
Enter.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.300
The phone number provided by Zhou Hui,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.550
the paid parcel locker order,

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.950
and the warehouse
receiving the wax figure

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.530
lead to the same person.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.180
(Phone number owner: Zheng Xintao)

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.480
It's the victim Zheng Xintao.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.000
Correct.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.310
Zheng Xintao hired someone

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.590
to dispose of his corpse.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.240
Well...

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.740
It must be someone close
to him to get hold

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.720
(Zheng Xintao)
of his phone and ID card.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.560
That's right.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.550
Captain He, we found out

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.070
that Zheng Xintao's parents

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.230
divorced in the early years,

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.360
and each formed a new family.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.030
They've been living abroad for years,

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.260
saying they can only come back

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.780
to cooperate with us a week later.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.750
His parents are so aloof.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.310
No wonder no one reported

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.600
after he was missing for a month.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.550
The victim is Zheng Xintao.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.130
From the subcutaneous bleeding points

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.790
and the burns in the respiratory tract,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.310
the most likely cause of death

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.380
is mechanical asphyxiation.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.300
(Qin Haichao, senior medical examiner)
His hyoid bone was not fractured,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.990
so he couldn't have been strangled.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.590
From the skin of the victim,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.880
we also found formalin.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.210
There were also residues

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.750
of preservatives in the blood vessels.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.270
The killer may have performed

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.240
preservation treatment

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.280
before putting the body
into the wax figure.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.240
Mechanical asphyxia

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.960
but not strangulation?

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.240
He could've drowned

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.200
in other liquids.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.940
(Test Record)

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.100
(5. A circular opening
at the crack of the wax figure)

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.160
Removing organs
and injecting preservatives

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.550
are steps in specimen preparation.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.350
Why leave the intestines?

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480
In the large intestine,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.890
a knife wound was also found.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.190
But...

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:35.880
The level of disgust

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.000
is beyond imagination.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.750
After failing to make a specimen,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.590
she tried again

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.020
to seal the victim in a wax figure.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.190
Black unidentified fragments
at the back of the neck

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.750
were tested.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.990
(Film component)
It was caused by the burning of film,

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.160
indicating that when the killer
committed the murder,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.740
efficiency was not the top priority.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.240
The victim's state at death

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.880
appeared doll-like.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.790
This represents a collection.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.380
So, in that case,

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.550
the killer has the potential
to commit serial crimes.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.510
We still need to see

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.700
whether the conditions
that trigger the killer's desire

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.680
will appear again.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.040
Let's keep it going.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.200
Focus on close relationships

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.140
around Zheng Xintao,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.400
especially with Chen Danling.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.410
Let's stop here for today.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.830
When will the news

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.670
be ready?

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.080
I'm looking forward to it.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.810
This is the contract
for additional copies of the new book.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.640
With so many copies,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.600
can we sell them all?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.030
Don't worry about that.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.750
I just paid

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.000
that man.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.750
Such promotions

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.920
should stop.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.110
The risk is too high.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.450
It's just to pay a fine

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.850
at the public security bureau.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.400
Compared

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.480
to certain criminal acts,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.640
this is just child's play.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.310
Have Zheng Xintao's belongings

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.440
all been dealt with?

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.480
They've been dumped.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.400
(Zhi Fei)
It'll be released soon.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.720
Don't worry.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.110
So, can I go

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.830
visit Mr. Xu?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.830
Which outfit do you think

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.460
would be better to meet with the police?

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.920
I've prepared the press release.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.740
Red should look better on camera.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.350
Black might be more imposing.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.080
Sure.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.840
Captain He.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.400
This is the guest list

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400
for the book club.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.550
This is a list of women

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.740
likely related to Zheng Xintao

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.200
in his call records.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.110
Next, we need to conduct cross-checking.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.430
(On-site List)
Chen Danling is among them.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.270
(Freight driver)
Based on the current info,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.950
Zheng Xintao's romantic relationships

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.850
are very complicated.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.720
If emotional disputes

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.590
are a motive,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.880
the scope will be very broad.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:02.610
A woman who loves but cannot have.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.210
A man whose love was stolen away.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.550
I think both are possible.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.260
This wax figure maker, Wang Zhe,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.030
often travels between China and abroad.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.200
I just found out he bought a ticket back

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.040
four days ago.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.300
He's already in the country,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.000
right at the studio where Chen Danling

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.040
customized the wax figure.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.310
Bye.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.150
Well done.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.340
(Wuyang Public Security Bureau)
We've confirmed

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.950
Chen Danling and the victim Zheng Xintao

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.090
had an intimate relationship.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.790
Based on the specimen

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.880
and the wax figure,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.480
I think it's Chen Danling.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.280
What do you think?

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.170
(Loyalty to the Party)
The murderer must harbor

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.440
(Strict Discipline)
resentment

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.810
to burn the victim with the film.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.000
And the target is very clear.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.750
It's like someone

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.720
who turns love into hate.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.740
What's your conclusion?

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.750
In psychology, it's called antisocial.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.600
The classification
of clinical personality types

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.240
is complex.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.000
If you're interested,
I'll give you a book.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.610
I only mentioned a technical term

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.920
to communicate better with you.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.960
I couldn't just say

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.200
I suspect Chen Danling
based on intuition, right?

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.720
(Wuyang Public Security Bureau)

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.240
Why don't you trust your intuition?

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.140
(Examples of Criminal Psychology)

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.480
Ms. Chen,

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.200
we just wanted to ask a few

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.500
things about your novel earlier.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.070
But why did you leave

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.300
without saying a word that day?

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.480
Officer,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.240
you agreed to let me

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.340
go home to change clothes.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.590
You didn't say I couldn't come today.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.200
Have you seen this before?

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.550
It was custom-made

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.590
at Jian Wax Figure Studio
half a year ago

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.550
in the name of the publishing house

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.050
to coordinate with the promotion
of the new book.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.640
But a month ago,

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.240
the studio informed us

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.920
that the wax figure was lost

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.210
due to special circumstances.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.480
They returned the principal,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.920
so it was then dropped.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.480
I did indeed use

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.110
Zheng Xintao as a model

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.440
to make such a wax figure,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.000
but that is just a wax figure.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.670
Take a look at this.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.920
This is the one I made.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.070
I didn't finish making this wax figure

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.500
before Zheng Xintao and Chen Danling

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.340
broke up.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.070
Then Wang Chen told me

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.120
there was no need to do it

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.990
or refund the money.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.790
I just left it there.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.750
I didn't know it was lost.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.600
Can a human body be directly made
into a wax figure?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.880
Impossible.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:35.510
You've just watched too many movies.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960
When I make wax figures,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.980
to ensure the sturdiness
of the sculpture,

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.830
I'll make the body part

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.680
with a fiberglass model inside

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.520
as support.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.480
It surely can't fit a person inside.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.350
How did the killer

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.240
manage to do it?

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.030
Since the wax figure was lost,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.800
didn't you think about making a new one?

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.750
A wax figure like that

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.160
requires 800 hours

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160
to complete production.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.920
Half a year is the shortest time.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.910
Mr. Xu, actually,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.670
I recognized you at first glance,

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.030
but at that time,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.950
the situation was too unusual.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.920
I even brought your

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.190
Examples of Criminal Psychology.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.070
It's been especially inspiring to me.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.800
After it ends,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.420
can you sign your name on it?

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.920
Ms. Chen,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.590
I read your novel.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.440
I remember a plot

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.480
very clearly.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.760
After the film is heated,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.360
it's used to suffocate someone.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.070
Where did you get

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.880
the inspiration from?

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.280
It comes from Zheng Xintao.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.670
He is my ex-boyfriend.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.920
He likes to use a film camera.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.920
Are you suspecting them now?

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.590
I watched an interview.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.970
In order to write a novel,

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.010
Chen Danling and Wang Chen

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.120
studied wax figure making.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.630
Do they have the ability

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.190
to put the corpse inside the wax figure?

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.350
Wang Chen

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.710
surely would not do such a thing.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.550
Why do you say that?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.920
If you have to think that way,

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.720
I think

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.980
Chen Danling is more likely.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.070
I don't know anything.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.710
Zheng Xintao is dead.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.840
Dead?

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.630
But Chen Danling...

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.480
I often go to the publishing house,

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.880
so I've heard a lot

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.030
of rumors about her.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.030
The first five books she wrote

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.150
sold extremely well.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.440
She also sold many IP rights

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.710
and made quite a lot of money.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.870
But the stories of the last two books

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.030
are a bit repetitive,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.440
so the sales

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
went down.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.800
She made a lot of exaggerated,

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.590
attention-grabbing promotions.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.030
You don't seem surprised.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.660
You are criminal police officers.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.400
When you came to me,

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.520
it means either he committed a crime,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.320
or he was the victim.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.270
That's not hard to guess.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.400
I don't know

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.510
whether her promotion ideas

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.800
were from Zheng Xintao.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.150
Chen Danling once said

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:04.280
Zheng Xintao was her muse idol.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.550
Wasn't he your boyfriend?

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.480
We'd actually been together

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.630
for less than a month.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.440
Our feelings weren't that deep.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.760
Moreover,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.280
if I pretend to be sad

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.780
in front of the criminal psychologist,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.360
wouldn't that make me more suspicious?

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.670
Since Chen Danling

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.130
has completely lost commercial value,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.800
why did Wang Chen

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.270
still insist on publishing her book?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.630
Listen, I asked the same question.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.840
Wang Chen told me

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.510
she cannot abandon her friend.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.380
You think Chen Danling is suspicious.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.150
Apart from the breakup,

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.310
is there any other evidence?

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.160
Do photos count?

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.360
Before,

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.480
Chen Danling brought a lot

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.920
of their photos to the studio

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.150
to show off to us.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.800
Later,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.210
after the two of them broke up,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.740
we found out

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.880
Zheng Xintao had taken many

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.820
indecent photos of her.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.890
Chen Danling repeatedly
asked Zheng Xintao

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.780
to return the photos,

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.470
but failed.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.630
Only then did she threaten

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.320
to kill

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.600
Zheng Xintao.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.550
Are you trying to ask

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.840
whether I killed him?

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.150
According to your logic,

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.070
since current existing murder methods

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:19.670
in this world

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.920
have all been written in novels,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.300
does that mean you'll arrest

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.190
all the authors
