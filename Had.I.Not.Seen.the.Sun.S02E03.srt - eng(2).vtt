Hello, Tien-ching. It's me again.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:15.787
What's your reason this time?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.247
Did you forget your keys,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.499
or is your mom out
with her boyfriend again?

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.589
If I told you my mom ran away with a man
and didn't want me anymore,

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:28.466
would you take me in?

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:33.555
Are you okay?

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:37.934
You're so gullible!

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:39.477
That's what I like about you.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.688
I want hot chocolate.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:43.565
Not too hot. Extra sugar.

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:55.243
The view from your place is so beautiful.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.371
Looking at it cheers me up.

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:34.550
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.631
Whatever happens in the future,

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:15.675
I'll always be with you.

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.344
I won't let go of your hand
so easily again.

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.056
Really? You said it.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:04.932
Hsiao-tung.

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.769
Are you still sleeping?

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:10.563
Hsiao-tung?

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.858
Do you hear me?

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:20.323
I just went to your new school
and completed all the paperwork.

00:04:20.823 --> 00:04:23.076
Well, school is starting soon.

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.411
Do you want to check out your new school?

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.125
Hsiao-tung?

00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:25.221
MISSED CALL FROM YUN-CHEN

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:29.684
Are you okay?

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:31.853
Why didn't you pick up?

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:33.187
It's been several days.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.647
I'm so worried.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.232
Call me when you can.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.484
Or reply in the messaging app.

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:39.569
Okay?

00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:03.426
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ONLINE IN A WHILE

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.068
WICKEDYA: HI, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.698
WHEN ARE WE HANGING OUT AGAIN? MISS YOU

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:31.537
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS VIDEO?
THE PERSON IN IT LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:47.678

00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.482
THEY ALL CAME IN HER?
SHE'S DESTROYED

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:00.858
FUCK! I WENT TO YI-X SCHOOL

00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:04.028
JERKED
HER FAMILY HAS A BBQ STALL

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:05.196
I EVEN KNOW HER MOM

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.074
I GOT HARD AND CAME

00:07:08.157 --> 00:07:10.159
SHE WAS CLEARLY RAPED
JERK OFF TO THIS

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:13.496
YI-X SCHOOL YEAR 2, X HSIAO-TUNG

00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:33.683
SLUT

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.935
YI-X HIGH SCHOOL,
LITTLE BITCH, X HSIAO-TUNG

00:08:20.813 --> 00:08:22.356
DAMN WHORE, NEEDS A GOOD FUCKING

00:08:27.695 --> 00:08:28.654
What happened?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.325
Hsiao-tung!

00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:33.909
Hsiao-tung, what's going on?

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:35.328
Open the door!

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.414
What should we do?
You're scaring us! What are you doing?

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:40.583
What are you doing inside? Open the door!

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.627
Pry open the door. Hurry.

00:08:43.628 --> 00:08:44.587
Hsiao-tung!

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:12.948
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang, do you mind
stepping out with me for a bit?

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:19.955
Come on.

00:09:36.847 --> 00:09:39.141
Let's meet our first lucky listener.

00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:41.811
Could you introduce yourself?

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:45.147
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:09:45.898 --> 00:09:49.360
My dream is to become a radio DJ.

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:52.029
Why?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.324
Truth is, due to a congenital condition,

00:09:55.408 --> 00:09:57.201
I have optic atrophy.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.499
Since my illness started in high school,
my vision has dropped to 0.01.

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:07.795
Now all I can see are blurry silhouettes.

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.756
I can barely see colors.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.925
So instead of watching TV,

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:14.635
I prefer listening to the radio.

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:16.387
I also like classical music.

00:10:18.347 --> 00:10:20.808
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:24.895
My dream is to become a radio DJ.

00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:28.065
Why?

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:31.110
Truth is, due to a congenital condition,

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:32.903
I have optic atrophy.

00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:35.072
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:37.908
My dream is to become a radio DJ.

00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:39.702
I also like classical music.

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:41.871
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:44.582
My dream is to become a radio DJ.

00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:48.335
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:06.228
Wanna play with me?

00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.148
I spat boba all over his head.

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:11.650
You can't blame me.

00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:15.237
It's his own fault
for passing by at that very second.

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:16.697
The street is only so wide.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.327
Hey. I'm Chi-chi.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:23.996
What about you?

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.414
What is your name?

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:33.422
Hey.

00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:35.674
Let me tell you a little secret.

00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:39.011
I really hate this world.

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:40.805
But

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:43.724
I don't seem to hate you.

00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:46.769
Hey.

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:48.229
Hey!

00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:50.397
Don't give me the cold shoulder.

00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:52.566
Hey.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:55.444
Hurry up and tell me your name.

00:11:56.153 --> 00:11:57.154
Hey!

00:11:57.738 --> 00:11:59.156
Hurry!

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.159
Hurry up and tell me.
How else can we become good friends?

00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:03.118
Hey.

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:07.623
Hsiao-tung.

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.293
Do you feel okay today?

00:12:11.377 --> 00:12:13.254
Are your wounds hurting?

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.716
Mr. and Mrs. Chiang,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.927
there is something I must tell you.

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:23.347
Hsiao-tung has
a few deep wounds on her face.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.976
We took extra care while stitching them,

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:30.688
but I'm afraid they will still leave
big scars on her face.

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:32.982
You can consider
getting laser therapy later.

00:12:33.482 --> 00:12:35.442
But you should still be mentally prepared.

00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.069
No matter how hard you try,

00:12:37.152 --> 00:12:40.114
she might never look the same again.

00:12:42.908 --> 00:12:44.368
Then let her become different.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.704
The bigger the change, the better.

00:12:47.997 --> 00:12:50.833
Right, the more she changes, the better.

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:53.043
It would be best
if nobody could recognize her.

00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:21.697
Look.

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:23.699
I'm a caterpillar.

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:26.911
You are a butterfly.

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:28.162
I am you.

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:29.788
You are me.

00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:31.290
Hey.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:35.878
Did you know that butterflies
are the world's most morbid creatures?

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:38.339
Why did you tattoo a thing like that
on your finger?

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:40.382
It's true.

00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:43.510
Do you know
how caterpillars turn into butterflies?

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:46.263
First, they dissolve into a soup.

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:48.599
Then their organs develop gradually.

00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:50.684
Finally, they become butterflies.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.271
They kill themselves first.

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:57.149
Hey, isn't that twisted?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.410
Hey.

00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:09.870
Hey.

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:11.372
Can you

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.875
do me a favor?

00:14:17.169 --> 00:14:19.254
Tell me!

00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:25.803
Can you

00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:28.597
help me

00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:29.932
kill myself?

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.687
You're really twisted!

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.188
Okay!

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.564
I promise you!

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:39.233
I love it!

00:14:40.693 --> 00:14:41.860
I promise you.

00:14:42.695 --> 00:14:44.196
I will make sure

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:46.115
to kill you properly.

00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:05.467
Hsia Tien-ching!

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.188
It's been a while.

00:15:25.654 --> 00:15:26.739
Hsia Tien-ching.

00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:32.786
I'm sorry I didn't answer
your call last time.

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:37.041
You don't have to explain.

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:39.460
I understand.

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:41.795
After all, I'm different from most people.

00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:44.214
I misunderstood you earlier.

00:15:44.798 --> 00:15:45.674
Don't worry.

00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:49.678
I don't want to, and I won't, bother you.

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.557
No.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.771
I didn't run away because of you.

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:00.939
It was because of me.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.193
What do you mean?

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:08.030
I've been hiding a lot from you

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.824
because I'm afraid

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:13.911
you won't accept me once you know.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.830
You haven't told me.

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:18.707
How do you know I won't accept you?

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:29.676
I once stabbed someone with a knife
and was imprisoned for six years.

00:16:31.136 --> 00:16:32.471
I was just released this year.

00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:38.102
Now I'm doing odd jobs to make a living.

00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:43.774
Sometimes at a construction site,

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:45.984
other times at a cleaning company.

00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:49.738
The pay at the cleaning company
is more stable.

00:16:50.739 --> 00:16:52.199
But some of the places I go to

00:16:52.741 --> 00:16:54.368
are crime scenes

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:56.161
and hoarder houses.

00:16:57.412 --> 00:16:58.914
Even with protective gear,

00:16:58.997 --> 00:17:01.542
I feel like that smell is still on me
when I go home.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.711
So every time I meet with you,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.339
I take a shower before heading out.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.593
Because I'm scared…

00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:15.722
I'm scared you'd smell that stench.

00:17:21.228 --> 00:17:22.563
I'm not a catch.

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:26.233
Anyone would think
I'm not good enough for you

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:28.318
if they saw us together.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.196
I also know

00:17:31.947 --> 00:17:33.532
that I should stop seeing you,

00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:35.784
that I should forget you.

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:37.327
But…

00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:44.877
we haven't seen each other
these past few days…

00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:48.338
and I…

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.888
I've missed you so much.

00:18:03.812 --> 00:18:06.648
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:10.569
Just because you've told me now
doesn't mean I'm not angry.

00:18:15.782 --> 00:18:16.825
I'm sorry.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.037
As long as you stop being angry,

00:18:20.913 --> 00:18:22.497
I'll do anything you want.

00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:28.295
Really?

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.256
You said it.

00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:43.769
Are you sure this is where you want to go?

00:18:46.396 --> 00:18:47.356
Yes.

00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:50.484
When I was in high school,

00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:52.861
my friends who were a couple
brought me here.

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:55.072
They had so much fun at the time.

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:58.242
Perhaps my vision started getting worse

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.410
because I saw how affectionate they were.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:06.333
I've always wanted to come back to
a place like this and have some real fun.

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:10.420
But later on, I couldn't see anymore
and didn't want to trouble anyone.

00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:13.340
But I will keep troubling you today

00:19:14.883 --> 00:19:16.343
because you said

00:19:16.843 --> 00:19:18.512
I can ask you to do anything.

00:19:19.596 --> 00:19:21.598
Sure, I'll play with you.

00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:25.310
You have to introduce
every single game to me.

00:19:25.394 --> 00:19:27.729
I will be really annoying today.

00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.189
I'm not scared of that.

00:19:30.274 --> 00:19:31.149
Let's go.

00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:14.920
Thank you.

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.215
Let's go.

00:21:19.132 --> 00:21:21.301
Hey, this is for you.

00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:25.222
No need. You won this.

00:21:25.305 --> 00:21:27.391
It's okay. I have this one.

00:21:33.563 --> 00:21:34.773
Did you have fun today?

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:01.425
Let's go.

00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.281
Hey.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.867
I haven't forgiven you yet.

00:22:29.453 --> 00:22:32.122
Then… what else do I have to do?

00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:35.709
You said you were going to send me
a photo of yourself.

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:39.337
So I've decided
that if you're good-looking,

00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:41.089
I'll forgive you.

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:45.552
Okay.

00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:48.638
No editing the photo.
We'll take it together.

00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:51.808
5:05. Camera.

00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:56.104
Camera mode.

00:22:56.188 --> 00:22:57.230
Capture.

00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:04.529
Is it aligned?

00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:09.451
Capture. Press.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.831
TIEN-CHING: I FORGIVE YOU

00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:12.222
5:30 p.m.

00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:13.515
One notification.

00:24:14.015 --> 00:24:15.642
Messages. Now.

00:24:15.725 --> 00:24:17.936
Li Jen-yao. What's for dinner?

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:54.681
Tien-ching.

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:48.128
That's okay. Do your thing.

00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:52.716
Well, let's wait
until you pick me up later

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:55.719
to figure out where to buy it.

00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:05.395
End. Press.

00:27:18.408 --> 00:27:19.617
Ms. Hsia.

00:27:21.035 --> 00:27:22.454
Was that your boyfriend?

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:26.583
What does he do for a living?

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.668
Is he nice to you? What's he like?

00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:33.965
Ms. Chou,
you're acting like I'm your daughter.

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:37.010
Do you question your daughter
that way at home too?

00:27:38.678 --> 00:27:40.305
No, I don't.

00:27:42.766 --> 00:27:44.809
She wouldn't give me the chance

00:27:44.893 --> 00:27:46.561
to ask her these questions.

00:27:48.229 --> 00:27:49.647
How can that be?

00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:53.693
I remember you said
your daughter is studying dance abroad.

00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:56.654
She must have a lot of suitors.

00:27:56.738 --> 00:27:59.115
You should worry about her, not me.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.876
What's wrong, Ms. Chou?

00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:13.505
It's nothing.

00:28:14.756 --> 00:28:15.924
It's just…

00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:20.637
I haven't seen her in a long time.

00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:23.264
Now that you suddenly ask about her,

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:26.184
I kind of miss her.

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:34.484
Okay, no problem.

00:28:35.109 --> 00:28:38.071
I will ask our legal team
to send you the contract soon, Mr. Chang.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.615
We'll count on you, Mr. Chang.

00:28:41.115 --> 00:28:42.283
Okay.

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:44.410
Thank you. Okay, bye.

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:47.705
Hey, Wen-ling.

00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:49.916
The boss asked about tomorrow's proposal.

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:51.668
Reply as soon as you can.

00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:52.877
I'll reply now.

00:28:58.341 --> 00:28:59.884
PAY YOUR DEBT, OR I'LL RUIN YOU!

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:01.970
LAST WARNING,
REPLY IN TEN MINUTES, OR ELSE!

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:09.143
I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYONE
IN YOUR COMPANY RECEIVES THIS VIDEO

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.652
Motherfucker, I had to do that
before you would call me back, didn't I?

00:29:18.444 --> 00:29:19.904
Please don't be angry.

00:29:20.405 --> 00:29:21.489
I'm sorry.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.742
I didn't ignore your messages. I was just…

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:26.244
Cut the chatter.

00:29:26.327 --> 00:29:29.873
I'll send someone to your place tonight
to collect payment for this period.

00:29:29.956 --> 00:29:31.791
I'm not refusing to pay.

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:35.295
I really don't have the money
to pay you back right now.

00:29:35.378 --> 00:29:37.422
If you don't have money, we can negotiate.

00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:39.257
But you ignored my calls and texts.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.552
You're fucking asking me
to send someone after you, aren't you?

00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:46.055
I just didn't know what to do.

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:48.766
How about this? Here's one last option.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.894
I'll still send someone
to your place today.

00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:52.812
I'll try to get a job for you,

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:55.607
so that you can at least pay
the interest for this period.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.400
All right?

00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:28.014
Okay, it's assembled.

00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:29.766
Do you want to check it out?

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.159
You picked a good shelf.

00:30:49.035 --> 00:30:51.287
It's exactly at hand level
when I reach out.

00:30:54.082 --> 00:30:54.958
Glad you like it.

00:31:01.297 --> 00:31:02.924
How come it's suddenly raining?

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:05.802
I just watered my plants.

00:31:07.261 --> 00:31:08.763
I should head home

00:31:09.347 --> 00:31:10.640
before the rain picks up.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.832
Do you want to…

00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:41.838
do you want to wait
until the rain stops before you leave?

00:32:25.923 --> 00:32:27.884
Can I ask you a question?

00:32:32.138 --> 00:32:33.347
What is it?

00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:38.811
You can answer me honestly. It's okay.

00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:44.400
Do you feel bored when you are with me?

00:32:50.323 --> 00:32:51.699
Why do you ask?

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.162
Because I realized

00:32:57.288 --> 00:32:59.457
that you're very quiet
when you are next to me.

00:33:00.374 --> 00:33:02.710
I'm always the one who speaks up.

00:33:03.961 --> 00:33:05.129
Like right now.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.424
I don't think I've asked
if you like classical music.

00:33:08.508 --> 00:33:11.010
But I keep playing it for you anyway.

00:33:14.764 --> 00:33:16.099
To be honest,

00:33:17.475 --> 00:33:19.560
I don't know if I like classical music.

00:33:21.395 --> 00:33:22.605
But I do know…

00:33:25.775 --> 00:33:27.819
I like every piece you've played for me.

00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:32.115
Really?

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:38.579
If anything,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.457
I'm the one who should be afraid.

00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:45.044
Because I don't talk much.

00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:49.090
I'm afraid you'll find me boring.

00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:51.217
I'm afraid

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:54.512
you'll get bored with me.

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:01.894
If that's the case,

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.981
when you are with me,

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.067
it's okay if you don't want to talk

00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:10.611
or don't know what to say.

00:34:12.071 --> 00:34:14.657
Just let me know that you're not sad.

00:34:20.538 --> 00:34:22.039
How could I possibly be sad…

00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:25.543
when I'm with you?

00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:21.724
Let me tell you a secret.

00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:26.020
I can't see well with my eyes,

00:35:27.813 --> 00:35:29.315
but amazingly…

00:35:32.235 --> 00:35:34.195
I always feel like I can see you.

00:35:58.636 --> 00:36:00.388
I know you won't believe it.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.058
But every time I'm with you,

00:36:04.934 --> 00:36:07.395
I secretly picture your face.

00:36:08.437 --> 00:36:10.064
As I continue to picture you,

00:36:11.774 --> 00:36:13.317
your face

00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:17.697
appears effortlessly in my mind.

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:22.952
Just like right now.

00:37:51.082 --> 00:37:51.916
Take the key card.

00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.418
The elevator leads to guest rooms.

00:37:57.088 --> 00:37:58.172
Hey.

00:37:58.964 --> 00:38:01.384
Hey! I said to take the key card.

00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:03.886
The elevator at the back
leads to guest rooms.

00:38:03.969 --> 00:38:05.679
Must I repeat it? You want a beating?

00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:11.852
Now get out. What are you waiting for?

00:38:11.936 --> 00:38:14.313
I have to pick up other ladies, okay?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.942
Hurry up and get out!

00:38:56.939 --> 00:38:58.149
I'm sorry.

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:02.486
Did I tell you to run?

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.488
You're good at running, aren't you? Run!

00:39:04.572 --> 00:39:05.781
Where were you running to?

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.910
Easy. If you beat her to a pulp,
how will I fuck her?

00:39:12.121 --> 00:39:14.123
Hey, fatty, I told you.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.791
This is her first.

00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:17.960
She would definitely run.

00:39:18.043 --> 00:39:19.170
-Fuck.
-Come on.

00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:22.131
It's just selling your body.
Why'd you run? You cost me my bet.

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:23.716
Hurry up.

00:39:35.644 --> 00:39:37.438
I heard we went to the same school.

00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:41.150
Is that true? I don't remember.

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:43.444
We've never hooked up, have we?

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:45.404
Come here.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.907
You're quite pretty.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.618
If no one looks too closely,
you come off as above average.

00:39:52.036 --> 00:39:53.537
I don't see any signs of surgery.

00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:55.831
Girlfriend vibes could be
your selling point.

00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:57.291
I've seen your video.

00:39:57.374 --> 00:40:00.252
Nice color down there.
That could add a few thousand.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.713
What do you want?

00:40:02.796 --> 00:40:05.466
What? A test-drive of course.
How else can we price you?

00:40:05.549 --> 00:40:06.800
What do you mean?

00:40:10.387 --> 00:40:11.222
Sorry.

00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:13.933
Hey, miss.

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:16.352
The debt that you owe Nan

00:40:16.435 --> 00:40:20.523
has now been sold to us.

00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:22.691
That means, miss,

00:40:23.442 --> 00:40:24.860
we've bought you.

00:40:27.738 --> 00:40:28.948
From now on,

00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:32.576
you are our merchandise.

00:40:37.414 --> 00:40:38.249
No.

00:40:40.584 --> 00:40:42.002
No.

00:40:42.086 --> 00:40:44.213
No!

00:42:03.417 --> 00:42:04.501
Did you say

00:42:05.169 --> 00:42:07.254
they recorded everything

00:42:07.338 --> 00:42:08.672
from that day?

00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:12.801
They also posted the video online.

00:42:13.302 --> 00:42:14.553
That night,

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.098
Hsiao-tung found that video online

00:42:19.183 --> 00:42:21.518
in this very room.

00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:25.689
By the time we realized this,
it was already too late.

00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:29.568
Millions of people
had already seen the video online.

00:42:31.487 --> 00:42:34.198
We lost count of
how many people we hired to help.

00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:35.949
We spent a lot of money

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.118
hiring lawyers to find ways

00:42:39.411 --> 00:42:42.498
to remove that video from the Internet.

00:42:43.123 --> 00:42:44.541
But it was no use.

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:52.007
Then how did Hsiao-tung become this way?

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.635
Her face

00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:57.429
and her eyes…

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.309
Why did she turn into a different person?

00:43:03.602 --> 00:43:05.187
It's like she doesn't know me.

00:43:07.481 --> 00:43:09.817
Hsiao-tung didn't just forget you.

00:43:12.986 --> 00:43:14.655
She doesn't remember

00:43:14.738 --> 00:43:15.906
who we are either.

00:43:17.574 --> 00:43:20.744
Since the day
we took Hsiao-tung to the hospital,

00:43:20.828 --> 00:43:23.831
she has been confused and delirious.

00:43:24.915 --> 00:43:26.667
Later, I asked the doctor

00:43:27.376 --> 00:43:30.003
to not only fix the scars on her face

00:43:31.338 --> 00:43:33.340
but also make sure
nobody would recognize her.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.802
We even changed her name.

00:43:36.885 --> 00:43:38.846
But then Hsiao-tung started saying

00:43:38.929 --> 00:43:40.848
she couldn't see.

00:43:40.931 --> 00:43:43.016
She didn't know why she was there either.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.811
She even said
she wasn't the Chiang Hsiao-tung we knew.

00:43:48.439 --> 00:43:49.982
She said her name

00:43:51.358 --> 00:43:52.651
was Hsia Tien-ching.

00:43:55.863 --> 00:43:57.030
At first,

00:43:57.531 --> 00:44:00.826
we couldn't accept
how Hsiao-tung had turned out at all.

00:44:01.785 --> 00:44:03.245
We thought

00:44:03.328 --> 00:44:05.539
she had driven herself crazy

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:07.875
because she couldn't handle the trauma.

00:44:10.127 --> 00:44:13.338
So we went to many doctors and counselors,

00:44:13.422 --> 00:44:15.507
trying to bring her back to her old self.

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:18.761
But none of that worked.

00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:24.016
She still can't remember
anything that happened in the past.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:27.603
But later on, we realized

00:44:28.645 --> 00:44:31.982
things weren't quite what we thought.

00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:38.238
Although Hsiao-tung is nothing like
her old self,

00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:40.866
and she has forgotten us,

00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:46.205
she has also forgotten

00:44:46.705 --> 00:44:48.832
her worst nightmares.

00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:50.417
At that moment,

00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:52.294
we finally understood.

00:44:52.377 --> 00:44:54.379
Hsiao-tung didn't lose her mind.

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:57.674
She just chose a different way

00:44:58.675 --> 00:45:01.428
to give herself a chance to start over.

00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:04.139
If possible,

00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:05.724
once I'm in Taipei this time,

00:45:07.142 --> 00:45:08.894
I want to start over.

00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:11.396
Trust me.

00:45:13.023 --> 00:45:15.234
The next time we meet,

00:45:16.151 --> 00:45:17.528
I'll definitely be better

00:45:18.195 --> 00:45:19.655
than I am now.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.624
If we want to feel that happiness again,

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:33.460
the only thing we can do

00:45:34.586 --> 00:45:36.547
is perhaps let go.

00:45:37.673 --> 00:45:40.175
Let the happiness we couldn't keep

00:45:40.676 --> 00:45:42.094
remain in the past.

00:45:42.177 --> 00:45:43.262
Hsia Tien-ching!

00:45:54.815 --> 00:45:55.732
It's been a while.

00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:54.267
Go to hell.

00:47:54.851 --> 00:48:00.482
Go to hell…

00:48:00.565 --> 00:48:02.734
Go to hell!

00:48:21.503 --> 00:48:23.714
Could you tell us about

00:48:23.797 --> 00:48:26.174
how your eyes have affected your life?

00:48:26.258 --> 00:48:29.469
Any inconveniences or things like that?

00:48:30.887 --> 00:48:33.640
Rather than inconveniences in life,

00:48:33.724 --> 00:48:36.685
I think the greatest trouble

00:48:36.768 --> 00:48:42.607
is that many people pity me
because of my eyes.

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:45.652
When that happens,
I'm glad that I can't see well.

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:48.739
At least I don't have to see
what I don't want to.

00:48:48.822 --> 00:48:51.742
So sometimes I even feel

00:48:51.825 --> 00:48:53.827
that perhaps not being able to see

00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:57.080
is the best gift God has given me.

00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:38.124
