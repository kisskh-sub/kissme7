Mumu.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.880
Look.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.150
You look so elegant in this outfit.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.150
So beautiful.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.760
We've already prepared your room.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760
It's on the fourth floor.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.960
I'm not staying here.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.610
I want to live in my own home.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.220
He's not my father either.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.870
He's just your new husband.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.800
Mumu.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.450
Don't be so stubborn, okay?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.990
Don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.200
You refuse to move out

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.040
because you think Jin Zhao and your father

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.370
would come back for you.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.880
You're not a kid anymore.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
How can you still be so naive?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.990
He promised me

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.550
he would definitely come back to see me.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.240
He?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.550
Who?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200
Jin Zhao?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.240
Mumu.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.520
I forgot to tell you something

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.710
about Jin Zhao.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.520
The reason
he hasn't been in touch for years

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.640
is because he doesn't have

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.080
any decent job there.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.360
He's not your brother,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.820
and you're not his sister.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.670
Your father
also has his own new family now.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.800
You're not family anymore.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.590
So don't have too much contact with them

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.040
It's no good for you.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.320
Thank you.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.270
I'm Nana.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.040
I'm Jiang Mu.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.520
Hello, hello.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.350
Are you going there for tourism?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.790
I'm looking for someone.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.200
He's been in Manshi for many years.

A reunion after a long separation?

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.550
What kind of person is he?

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:58.960
Well, he...

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.500
had excellent grades.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.200
The walls at home

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.980
were covered with his awards.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.240
His knowledge emits elegance.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.220
He has a great personality

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.540
and is very gentle.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.800
He never loses his temper with me.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.680
His fingers are beautiful;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.829
slender and fair,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.930
with well-defined knuckles.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.880
You know what?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.880
He has beautiful handwriting.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.390
What does he look like?

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.720
Is he the handsome type?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.080
This is for you.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.960
When I come back,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.250
I'll check how your handwriting's

Don't let Jin Zhao

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.560
Bring her back quickly.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.620
Are you listening?

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.280
Go pick her up yourself.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.790
Go pick someone up for me.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.120

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.480
Sister?

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.630
I'll send you the details later.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.050

Let's ask that person.

Don't mind him.

All he does is drink all day long.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.230
He'll drink himself sick sooner or later.

Good thing

My dad was handsome when he was young.

Is that so?

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.410
Well, I never saw him when he was young.

I don't think I did.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:07.990
You added soy sauce, right?

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.599
Yes.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.310
I put in half a bottle of soy sauce.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.710
Then why would you add salt?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.640

She doesn't have to.

It's our first meeting after all.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.640
She should still greet you
even if it's the first meeting.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.440
You two

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.400

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.410
Say hello.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.710
Sister.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.050
Come.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.210
I brought gifts for you all.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.840
We're all family.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.990
Why spend this money?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.160
Look how well-raised this child is,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.680
polite and beautiful.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.640
I didn't add any fillers today.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.790
It's all pure meat.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.210
Why does she get more than me?

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.120
She's a guest.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.400
Isn't this filling

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.990
a bit too salty?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.470
It tastes fine to me.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.270
What would you know?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.750
You drink alcohol

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.990
like water every day.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.030
Your taste buds are pickled in alcohol.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.360
How can you taste anything?

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.890
No wonder

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.180
our restaurant is doing worse and worse.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.470
Brandy!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.030
What brings you here?

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.290
Hey, Brandy, I need to ask you something.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.160
Sanlai!

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.270
Have you eaten yet?

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.750
Go get a bowl.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.710
Come, sit here and have a drink with me.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.710
Everyone's home?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920
I'll pass today.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.470
Uncle, I'll drink with you next time.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.730
I need to talk to Brandy about something.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.890
You all eat first.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.350
I'll step out for a moment.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.840
Have you really thought this through?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.360
What if you die?

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.500
Your relative?

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.710
I'm leaving first.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.170
Think about it carefully.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.120
Young girl,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.310
my name is Sanlai.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
What's your name?

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.470
Jiang Mu.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.370
Meaning "yearning day and night"?

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.840
Jiang Mu.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.220
Come visit my shop sometime.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.480
I'll tell you a secret.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.920
Looking for me?

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.190
This is a gift for you.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.270
Don't spend money
buying things for me in the future.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.530
It's still necessary.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.920
After all, I'm...

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.490
a guest.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.650
What is he doing now

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.880
if he's not in school?

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.970
Why are there

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.990
blood stains on his face?

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.800
Are you sure about this?

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.840
What if you die?

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:37.650
[Zhao]

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.470
Brother.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.360
You dropped something.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.990
"Yearning day and night."

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.070
[Yearning day and night]

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:53.640
[I've approved your friend request.
We can now chat.]

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.600
Where are you?

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.270
I'm hungry.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.880
Come down.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.610
Where are we going?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.970
Weren't you hungry?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.460
Let's get some supper.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.280
Why are you skipping about?

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.990
We're going for supper.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.470
I'm just moving around a bit

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.510
so I can eat more.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.410
Do you normally like drinking—

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.680
You're not a kid anymore.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.810
Don't you know how to cross the street?

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.180
Do you know the way?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.750
No, I don't.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.200
Watch out!

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.670
Watch out for the puddle.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.560
Steamed buns?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.790
Barbecue?

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.290
Pick what you want.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.710
I can choose anything?

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.460
Let's go with the busiest stall then.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.190
Let's go.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.670
Seafood fried rice.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.900
Do you need anything else?

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.360
This and this.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.310
Is that all?

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.600
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.200
Like what?

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.790
It's been a long time.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.420
Aren't you curious

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.640
about my life

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.120
and how I've been doing?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.250
How's your stepfather?

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.200
Just so-so.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.750
So you ran away from home?

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.880
Who said I ran away?

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.400
Then why are you here?

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.470
I'm here as a tourist.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.030
Your mom bought you a return ticket.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.290
Get some rest tonight.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.200
I'll take you to the airport tomorrow.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.260
I'm not going back.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.750
Then call your mother.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.840
Fine.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.510
I'm not going back tomorrow.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.570
Cancel the ticket.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.440
I already asked her
to cancel tomorrow's flight.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:15.840
Did she agree?

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.030
It doesn't matter.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.290
I've already turned off my phone anyway.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.120
I heard there's a place here
with lots of young people.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.320
I want to check it out.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.950
Check it out for what?

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.360
For romance.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.600
Since you're not curious about my life,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.270
why don't we

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.930
talk about yours instead?

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.510
How have you been

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.400
all these years?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.510
Not great.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.400
Tell me more.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.630
I'll ask, and you answer.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.250
What do you want to know?

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.710
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.230
Work.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.310
What kind of work?

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.640
What about the day after?

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.900
Do you need something?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.750
Do you do anything else?

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.920
Make money.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.570
Besides making money?

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.400
Of course.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.860
Eat, drink, sleep,
take a dump, and have fun.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.720
Which one are you asking about?

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.470
Let's talk about

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.970
the "having fun" part.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.160
Are you sure you want to talk about that?

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:49.990
Why?

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.570
Not comfortable discussing it with me,
your sister?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.120
I've had too much fun,

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.340
can't remember it all right now.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.240
Then let's change the subject.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.190
Tell me about your new sister.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.400
You mean Jin Xin?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.970
Why are you smiling?

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.220
Bro, eating here again?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.550
New boyfriend?

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400
You're not replying to my messages.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.720
So you're here picking up girls?

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.790
Brandy.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.550
You like younger ones now?

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.340
Not even introducing her to your brothers?

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.550
Keeping her all to yourself.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.880
Stop talking nonsense.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.090
That's not what I do.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:12.410
Young girl,

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.000
let me introduce myself.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.270
I'm Crazy Jin.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.790
Wasn't she the girlfriend on your car?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.230
She's my...

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.680
Sister.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.460
She's here traveling.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.840
Leaving in a few days.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.310
Sister?

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.070
Isn't your sister in elementary school?

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.870
Where did this sister come from?

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.120
Are you

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640
related by blood?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.120
I heard

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.040
you're going to that match.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.920
That Lin is trouble.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.050
Be careful, he might kill you.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.830
Don't just eat.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.719
Can't we just chat?

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.760
Waiter!

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.440
Yes?

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.670
A dozen beers!

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.380
Another glass too!

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.280
Okay!

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:19.550
Can you drink?

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.800
I ditched that girl

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.070
just to come find you
and keep you company.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.670
Your drinks.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.239
Thanks.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.719
Hello? Check, please.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.840
Okay. Just wait a moment please.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:35.449
Your sister is easily satisfied.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.190
You want to take care of her?

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.989
Sure.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.239
Sister, hang out with me from now on.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.770
I'll make sure you eat and drink well.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.280
I'll feed you until you're plump,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.510
even prettier than now.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.280
How about it?

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:47.889
Is she really your sister?

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.070
She doesn't look like you.
