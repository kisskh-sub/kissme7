00:00:07.821 --> 00:00:09.239
What do you see now?

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:11.074
Nothing.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.120
How about this?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.871
Can you see this way?

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.834
It's still the same as before.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:22.460
I can't see anything.

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:09.132
Ms. Chou.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:11.050
It's me, Tien-ching.

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.137
Yes, I just left the hospital.

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:16.764
Don't worry.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.392
I've already called a cab.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:21.644
I can go to work on my own later.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.981
I have to go. Someone's calling me.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.482
I'll call you back later.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.737
Accept and answer. Press.

00:01:33.406 --> 00:01:35.366
-Hello?
-Miss, may I ask where you are?

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.910
I'm at the pickup location.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:38.036
I'm sorry.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.872
Well, I'm already at the intersection.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:42.957
But I can't see well.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.792
Could you come get me?

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:46.461
Okay, sure.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:47.921
Thank you.

00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:52.300
End. Press.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:55.553
Miss, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you couldn't see. Sorry.

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.263
-It's okay.
-Let me guide you.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.904
Where did the driver take me?

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.990
I was very clear with him.

00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:52.902
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:17.260
I'm sorry.

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:19.762
I thought you were someone else.

00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:06.077
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:28.307
Are you

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.892
Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.574
May I ask if you're Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:05:49.412 --> 00:05:50.663
I mistook you for someone else.

00:06:09.724 --> 00:06:11.559
I'm sorry.

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:13.436
I know I shouldn't have shown up.

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.985
I'm sorry.

00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.738
I didn't mean to disturb you guys.

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:26.157
Wait!

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.367
Stop hitting me.

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:32.079
Earlier, I mistook her for someone else.

00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:34.123
I thought she was Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:35.333
Stop hitting me.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.213
Why are you looking for her?

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:44.425
I want to apologize.

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:49.472
I want to know if she's doing well now.

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:53.392
If she's not,
I'm willing to make it up to her.

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:55.478
I hope she can forgive me.

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:07.323
Let me tell you two things.

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:11.244
First, don't show your face
around me again.

00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.203
Second,

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:15.581
stop looking for Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.000
Otherwise,

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.378
I'll definitely kill you.

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:45.945
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:48.739
No worries.

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:51.951
Did you find your phone?

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:56.205
Yes, I found it.

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.393
Be careful, there's a step ahead.

00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:29.322
Wait.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.493
This is Debussy's "Clair de lune."

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:38.331
I love this piece.
Have you heard it before?

00:08:54.096 --> 00:08:55.056
Perfect timing.

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:15.826
What's wrong?

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.081
Why are you

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.041
so quiet?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.969
Do you like to dance?

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.434
I don't know.

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:42.853
But I have poor balance.

00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:44.647
I'm no good at sports.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.149
Forget about dancing.

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.610
I can't even ride a bike.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.821
Even if

00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:54.740
I could see well now,

00:09:55.241 --> 00:09:57.201
I don't think I'd like dancing.

00:09:59.078 --> 00:10:00.413
Did you ask me that

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:03.040
because you like dancing?

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.757
No.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.014
Let's go.

00:10:19.098 --> 00:10:20.391
It's about to rain.

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:22.768
Okay.

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:42.955
Be careful.

00:10:56.927 --> 00:10:57.970
I'm sorry.

00:10:58.053 --> 00:11:00.181
You're soaked because of me.

00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:03.934
It's okay.

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:05.603
Don't worry about it.

00:12:30.396 --> 00:12:31.313
Well,

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:33.315
you can wipe yourself down.

00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:55.296
Do you like rainy days?

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:28.871
No.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.543
Me neither.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.465
Rain changes the smell of the air.

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:43.177
People and the environment
smell different.

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:47.514
I rely on my sense of smell a lot.
That's why I don't like rain.

00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:50.434
But…

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:55.189
I don't seem to dislike…

00:13:58.359 --> 00:13:59.860
the smell of rain today.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:35.980
We're here.

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:46.198
I had fun today.

00:14:46.699 --> 00:14:47.533
Thank you.

00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:54.873
I'll go home, then.

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:15.519
Wait, Li Jen-yao.

00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:23.152
Are you still there?

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:14.036
I'm all sweaty from earlier.

00:16:14.787 --> 00:16:15.913
Don't get too close.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:17.289
It's uncomfortable.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.759
I've wired this month's rent
to the landlord.

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:30.135
When are you gonna pay me?

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:32.221
And 1,200 NTD for water and electricity.

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:35.349
With the next rent.

00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:39.895
That's what you said last month.
When are you gonna look for a job?

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:43.774
Enough. You're such a nag.

00:16:48.237 --> 00:16:49.363
What are you watching?

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.532
Lisa Mimi.

00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:53.325
She's been a popular YouTuber lately.

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:54.493
Gosh.

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:56.203
She's so busty.

00:16:57.746 --> 00:16:58.956
That's all padding.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:01.875
She'd be lucky
to have had a B cup in high school.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.585
How do you know they're padded?

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:07.756
Don't be fooled by her pure looks
in front of the camera now.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.341
It's all an act.

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:12.094
In high school,
she was basically a delinquent.

00:17:12.177 --> 00:17:14.221
She was always around hooligans

00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:16.223
and picked on whoever she disliked.

00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:20.310
-Hey!
-What?

00:17:20.394 --> 00:17:21.562
I'm serious.

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:25.858
She thought a girl in our class
stole her solo part and got jealous,

00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:27.484
so she got a bunch of guys to rape her.

00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:28.902
Did you see it?

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:34.241
Save me!

00:17:34.783 --> 00:17:35.659
Shut up!

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:38.370
-Bitch. You'd better behave.
-Save me!

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:40.038
Save me!

00:17:41.373 --> 00:17:42.749
Wen-ling!

00:17:51.258 --> 00:17:52.968
Of course I didn't see it myself.

00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:55.888
I wasn't close to those people back then.

00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:57.639
I just heard about it.

00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:05.689
Anyway, she's not who you think she is.

00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:07.900
She's disgusting.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.669
Thanks for listening.

00:18:27.753 --> 00:18:29.630
Have a good night.

00:18:29.713 --> 00:18:32.007
I'm Hsia Tien-ching. Good night.

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:40.015
RISING RADIO

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:44.061
-Tien-ching.
-Yes?

00:18:44.144 --> 00:18:45.562
You're in great shape today.

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:47.397
You recorded three episodes in one go.

00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:49.608
Really? I feel the same as always.

00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:51.860
No, you're great today.

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:53.028
Also,

00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:54.655
you've been glowing lately.

00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:57.241
Are you dating?

00:18:57.324 --> 00:18:58.951
You had me help you put on makeup.

00:18:59.034 --> 00:19:00.744
No, don't talk nonsense.

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:02.496
Yes, you are.

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:05.082
What does he look like?
Show me a picture of him.

00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:08.585
I don't believe
someone can be nice and handsome.

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:09.878
He must be ugly, right?

00:19:09.962 --> 00:19:12.172
Or he's a con artist.

00:19:12.256 --> 00:19:15.425
The next time he sees you, he'll say,
"Tien-ching, have you heard of--"

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:16.635
Gosh, I'm leaving.

00:19:16.718 --> 00:19:18.637
Hey, all right.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.431
I'm just worried about you.
You've never acted this way.

00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:26.144
You're so proud and guarded,
and you don't like bothering others.

00:19:26.228 --> 00:19:29.564
What's so special about him
that you're acting like this?

00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:36.196
Even though it only lasted a moment,

00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:39.032
I saw him.

00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:50.877
What?

00:19:52.379 --> 00:19:53.380
What did you see?

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.842
What do you mean? Hey!

00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:23.577
Damn, how long has it been ringing?
Why don't you answer?

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:31.918
I found what you wanted.

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:42.888
I learned about the girl, Hsia Tien-ching,
from Chi-ming School.

00:20:47.392 --> 00:20:49.561
Because of a genetic disease,

00:20:49.644 --> 00:20:52.105
she can't see well
and does radio shows now.

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:03.033
Hey, I really don't understand
why you keep going to this girl.

00:21:03.116 --> 00:21:05.285
They don't look alike at all.

00:21:05.369 --> 00:21:08.205
Hey, their hair, eyes, auras, and figures

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:10.123
are completely different.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:13.418
Anyway, I think
what you're doing is terrible.

00:21:13.502 --> 00:21:15.921
If she knows
she's just a replacement to you,

00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:17.422
shit, she'll be miserable.

00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:19.257
Hey, she's a nice girl.

00:21:19.341 --> 00:21:20.884
She'll be sad for sure.

00:21:23.053 --> 00:21:24.721
I don't see her as a replacement.

00:21:26.223 --> 00:21:27.808
And she won't know anything.

00:21:29.935 --> 00:21:31.353
I won't be seeing her again.

00:21:35.607 --> 00:21:37.025
What's up with you lately?

00:21:37.943 --> 00:21:38.902
Talk to me.

00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:40.278
Hey, listen.

00:21:40.362 --> 00:21:42.072
I've dated enough girls

00:21:42.823 --> 00:21:44.157
to form a parade around Taiwan.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:47.536
I've seen a lot of relationships.

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:50.205
Want me to enlighten a virgin like you?

00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:51.248
Yeah?

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:54.793
No need.

00:21:55.335 --> 00:21:57.045
Just help me find Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:01.425
Don't forget

00:22:02.467 --> 00:22:04.302
that I'm working for you

00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:06.888
because you said you'd help me find her.

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:09.808
I have been looking for her.

00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:11.852
However,

00:22:13.478 --> 00:22:15.856
speaking from my experience
as a debt collector,

00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:18.108
not finding her after this long…

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.653
you need to be prepared.

00:22:22.154 --> 00:22:23.280
She's either abroad…

00:22:25.824 --> 00:22:26.658
or dead.

00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:31.413
I'm just asking.

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:35.584
If Chiang Hsiao-tung…

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:38.753
is really

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.089
dead,

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.175
what will you do?

00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:57.189
Then I'll kill them all.

00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.858
No one will get away.

00:23:14.498 --> 00:23:15.624
Your message.

00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:17.584
Li Jen-yao, are you busy?

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:19.461
14:45.

00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:21.254
Your message.

00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:22.964
Li Jen-yao, are you busy?

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:25.091
14:45.

00:23:37.103 --> 00:23:39.356
Answer call. Press.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.695
Miss, I've arrived. Where are you?

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:48.198
Oh, the car's here. Okay.

00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:50.033
I'm sorry. I'll be right down.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.977
Wait!

00:24:18.103 --> 00:24:19.229
-Thank you.
-No worries.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.856
Can you press eight for me, please?
Thank you.

00:24:45.422 --> 00:24:47.716
-For the name list…
-Confirm this for me later.

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.509
-Sure. I'll call you.
-Thank you.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.678
-Hey, Wang.
-Yes?

00:24:51.761 --> 00:24:53.888
This is content for the next episode.
Take a look.

00:24:53.972 --> 00:24:55.849
-Content for the show?
-Yes.

00:24:56.349 --> 00:24:57.601
Gosh, that's not important.

00:24:58.226 --> 00:25:00.312
What I'm curious about right now is

00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:03.231
why you haven't contacted that guy lately.

00:25:03.315 --> 00:25:05.233
What happened?

00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:08.320
Nothing. It's just how it is.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.114
We haven't seen each other
since that meal.

00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:13.658
He hasn't answered or called me back.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.203
I guess that's it, then.

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:19.164
Isn't that such a shame?

00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:22.792
It's rare for you
to like someone the way you like him.

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:27.631
Actually, come to think of it,
I don't know him at all.

00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:31.051
I only know his name and phone number.

00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:34.888
I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:38.975
If he stops contacting me,
I don't think I'll know how to find him.

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:43.980
Forget it.
Maybe he never saw me as a friend.

00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:45.774
That's why he ghosted me.

00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:48.818
-It's fine.
-What do you mean "it's fine"?

00:25:48.902 --> 00:25:52.030
It's not fine.
I'll help you find a better guy right now.

00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:53.156
What's your type?

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.785
Why are you playing matchmaker for me?
I'm doing fine.

00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:59.371
No way.
What are your requirements? Tell me.

00:26:01.206 --> 00:26:02.040
This way, please.

00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:04.417
Is this your office area?

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:05.627
It's much larger than I…

00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:08.213
-Sounds good.
-Let me show you.

00:26:08.296 --> 00:26:09.506
-I'll revise it.
-Thanks.

00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:11.091
Here's engineering.

00:26:11.174 --> 00:26:12.842
This is the recording studio.

00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:38.326
Hi, are you Mrs. Chiang?

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:39.661
Who are you?

00:26:39.744 --> 00:26:42.122
I'm Hsiao-tung's classmate.
I'm looking for her.

00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:44.708
She hasn't been in touch with us
for a long time.

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.335
Could you tell me how I can reach her now?

00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:49.045
She's abroad.

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.630
And she's not coming back.

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:54.509
If she doesn't keep in touch with you,
that means she doesn't want to.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:56.428
Don't bother us again.

00:27:10.275 --> 00:27:11.151
What's up with you?

00:27:11.818 --> 00:27:14.154
You're so quiet. It's so unlike you.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.575
When I went to a client
for a project discussion yesterday,

00:27:18.658 --> 00:27:20.577
I met a blind person in the elevator.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.786
The tattoo on her hand

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.205
looks exactly the same
as my high school classmate's.

00:27:24.706 --> 00:27:26.291
So I thought of her.

00:27:26.374 --> 00:27:27.876
Who? Which classmate?

00:27:29.252 --> 00:27:31.004
The girl I told you about before.

00:27:31.504 --> 00:27:33.173
The one who was gang raped.

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:36.176
I see. I think you've told me.

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:37.886
How's that girl now?

00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:40.597
Shortly after that incident,

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.682
she transferred to a school in Taipei.

00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:44.642
Then a little while later,

00:27:45.143 --> 00:27:46.519
I heard she had committed suicide.

00:27:46.603 --> 00:27:47.937
Was it that serious?

00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:52.400
What about those who raped her?

00:27:52.484 --> 00:27:53.610
What happened to them?

00:27:54.444 --> 00:27:55.403
Speaking of it…

00:27:55.487 --> 00:27:56.946
speaking of it makes me furious.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.072
You know what?

00:27:58.156 --> 00:28:00.742
One of those bastards
is the son of a councillor.

00:28:00.825 --> 00:28:02.744
So this was entirely swept under the rug.

00:28:02.827 --> 00:28:05.205
Nothing happened to those bastards.

00:28:05.288 --> 00:28:06.873
Later on, at a class reunion,

00:28:06.956 --> 00:28:08.917
I even heard they're all doing great.

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:11.795
All right.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.672
Listen, I'm going out later.

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:17.717
For mah-jongg with my friends.

00:28:17.801 --> 00:28:18.802
Hey.

00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:21.137
Didn't you agree
to spend time with me today?

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:22.931
Why are you going to play mah-jongg?

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.894
If you feel bored,

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:30.814
come join us.

00:28:31.397 --> 00:28:33.983
Didn't you say you're good at it?

00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:38.905
Just… think of it
as growing our dating fund.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:40.365
Come on.

00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:42.784
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.

00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:46.621
Give me tiles if you go before me.

00:28:46.704 --> 00:28:49.165
I'll help you for sure.
Just tell me what you need.

00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:52.544
Okay.

00:28:57.298 --> 00:28:59.259
-Seven Characters.
-Hey, Chow.

00:28:59.843 --> 00:29:00.885
Gap tile.

00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:02.971
Three Bamboo.

00:29:03.054 --> 00:29:04.389
Pung. One Character.

00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:06.683
Come on.

00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:07.600
Pung.

00:29:08.935 --> 00:29:10.520
-West Wind.
-Hey, I win.

00:29:10.603 --> 00:29:11.896
I was waiting for it.

00:29:12.397 --> 00:29:13.815
That's ridiculous.

00:29:13.898 --> 00:29:16.234
Who waits for that now?
You're so shameless.

00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:17.819
What? I knew you'd discard it.

00:29:17.902 --> 00:29:19.988
North Winds, Green Dragons, White Dragons,

00:29:20.071 --> 00:29:21.447
Triplets Hand, and Half Flush,

00:29:21.531 --> 00:29:24.534
plus the banker, 12 points in total.
Thank you, ma'am.

00:29:26.828 --> 00:29:28.955
Okay, I'm going to stop.
I'm so unlucky today.

00:29:29.747 --> 00:29:32.166
It's okay. You can recoup your losses.

00:29:33.084 --> 00:29:35.712
I have work tomorrow. Let's settle up.

00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.089
Here is…

00:29:39.132 --> 00:29:40.425
-5,000 NTD.
-Hey!

00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:43.052
What's this pocket change supposed to be?

00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:46.973
I'm paying up.
Aren't we betting 100 and 20?

00:29:47.056 --> 00:29:49.100
It can't be more than 5,000 NTD in total.

00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:52.061
Fuck. 100 and 20 NTD?
You think we're college students?

00:29:52.145 --> 00:29:53.479
We start at 10,000 NTD.

00:29:54.272 --> 00:29:57.567
-10,000?
-You've lost at least 600,000 today.

00:29:58.443 --> 00:30:01.321
Since you're Chuan's new friend,
I'll give you a discount.

00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:03.197
600,000 NTD will do.

00:30:04.324 --> 00:30:05.909
Hey, give me a promissory note.

00:30:07.535 --> 00:30:08.703
Wait a sec.

00:30:09.203 --> 00:30:10.163
Are you serious?

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:11.247
Of course!

00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:13.958
Chuan, what's with your girlfriend?

00:30:14.042 --> 00:30:15.585
She doesn't want to pay up?

00:30:15.668 --> 00:30:18.046
Hey, Nan. Don't say that.

00:30:18.129 --> 00:30:19.714
How can she be my girlfriend?

00:30:19.797 --> 00:30:22.634
She has to own what she did.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:24.093
I'm not involved with her.

00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:25.386
What are you talking about?

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.472
Don't look at me that way.

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:30.850
Don't say I didn't warn you.
This spot's really run by a crew.

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:33.394
It's different from
the other sessions you go to.

00:30:33.478 --> 00:30:35.730
If you play dumb and don't pay up,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.066
it will be no joke.

00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:49.035
Mr. Chen, here's the latest update.

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:51.079
We found Chiang Hsiao-tung's mom.

00:30:51.162 --> 00:30:52.372
But according to her,

00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:54.374
Chiang Hsiao-tung is abroad.

00:30:54.874 --> 00:30:56.542
-She's abroad?
-Yes.

00:30:56.626 --> 00:30:59.379
That's the last lead we have for now.

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:01.214
If you want to further investigate

00:31:01.297 --> 00:31:02.924
Chiang Hsiao-tung's whereabouts,

00:31:03.007 --> 00:31:05.551
the only options left are illicit means.

00:31:05.635 --> 00:31:06.970
Mr. Chen,

00:31:07.053 --> 00:31:08.930
are you sure you want to continue?

00:31:16.813 --> 00:31:19.232
When I was eating
with my colleague Wang today,

00:31:19.315 --> 00:31:21.401
I'm not sure if it was due to a hangover

00:31:21.484 --> 00:31:24.153
or the Monday blues,

00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:26.656
but she asked me
a very philosophical question.

00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:28.574
She asked,

00:31:28.658 --> 00:31:30.076
"Hey, Hsia Tien-ching,

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:34.622
how can I get
yesterday's happiness back today?"

00:31:35.206 --> 00:31:38.876
When I heard that, I really couldn't help
but roll my eyes at her.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.671
Yes, you heard me right. I rolled my eyes.

00:31:41.754 --> 00:31:45.466
Your ability to see and roll your eyes
are two separate matters.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.135
The point is,

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.554
after I rolled my eyes at her,

00:31:49.637 --> 00:31:53.057
I decided
to answer her question properly anyway.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.060
To be honest, we all know that

00:31:56.144 --> 00:31:58.938
there aren't many things in life

00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:00.398
that truly make us happy.

00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:03.276
We also tend to look on the bright side

00:32:04.569 --> 00:32:07.405
to guard that rarely found happiness,

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:08.823
so as to keep it in mind.

00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:14.412
Recently, I encountered something
that made me realize

00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:17.415
that a lot of the time, we feel unhappy,

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:21.085
maybe because we're too eager to hold onto

00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:24.464
those happy moments
we're so obsessed with.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.593
If we want to feel that happiness again,

00:32:29.385 --> 00:32:31.095
the only thing we can do

00:32:31.888 --> 00:32:33.765
is perhaps let go.

00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.477
Let the happiness we couldn't keep

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:39.437
remain in the past.

00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:43.107
All right, just a few more hours,

00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:45.193
and this Monday will be over.

00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:46.819
We can do this.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.948
Let's forget the happy moments in the past
that we're obsessed with

00:32:51.449 --> 00:32:54.368
and listen to some music that suits today.

00:32:57.872 --> 00:33:00.541
RISING RADIO

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:07.548

2:45 p.m.

00:33:15.348 --> 00:33:16.724
Are you busy?

00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:18.810
Are you busy?

00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.234
MISSED CALL, TIEN-CHING

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:26.335
You didn't answer my call
or reply to my message.

00:34:26.836 --> 00:34:28.004
What are you doing here now?

00:34:38.472 --> 00:34:40.474
Li Jen-yao, don't stay silent.

00:34:41.017 --> 00:34:42.226
Answer me.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.312
You stopped contacting me,

00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:46.480
so why did you come to my office?

00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:15.509
Ms. Hsia.

00:35:16.052 --> 00:35:17.470
Hey, Mr. Chiang.

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:20.181
I've been waiting for you.

00:35:20.264 --> 00:35:23.184
I saw you talking to your friend here.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.480
I don't mean to rush you,
but I have clients after this.

00:35:28.064 --> 00:35:28.898
I see.

00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:31.525
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:35:32.318 --> 00:35:34.153
I'm good to go now.

00:35:34.904 --> 00:35:36.322
-I'll take you, then.
-Okay.

00:35:36.906 --> 00:35:37.740
Here.

00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:42.078
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:36:09.647 --> 00:36:10.731
Ms. Hsia.

00:36:11.983 --> 00:36:14.443
Who was that guy earlier?

00:36:16.195 --> 00:36:17.697
A new boyfriend?

00:36:18.531 --> 00:36:20.700
You've been getting rides
from me for years,

00:36:20.783 --> 00:36:21.993
but I've never seen

00:36:22.076 --> 00:36:24.996
or heard you mention any guys.

00:36:25.788 --> 00:36:27.623
Mr. Chiang, you're overthinking.

00:36:28.124 --> 00:36:29.834
He's just an ordinary friend.

00:36:30.793 --> 00:36:32.837
Have you been feeling better?

00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:36.424
Didn't you just get out of the hospital?

00:36:36.507 --> 00:36:40.052
Why are you driving so soon?
Shouldn't you rest some more?

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:43.973
I have no choice.

00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:46.517
I don't have any income if I don't drive.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.312
But don't worry.

00:36:49.812 --> 00:36:51.355
I'm only driving you

00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:53.149
and some other regulars.

00:36:53.232 --> 00:36:56.902
Just a few hours a day. It's fine.

00:37:04.076 --> 00:37:05.536
Ms. Hsia, you're home?

00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:07.038
Ms. Chou, you're still here?

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:09.081
I'm just about to leave.

00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:09.999
I see.

00:37:11.584 --> 00:37:15.004
I brought some cherry tomatoes.
They're washed and in the fridge.

00:37:15.504 --> 00:37:16.922
Our relatives grew them.

00:37:17.673 --> 00:37:20.593
They're organic and super sweet.
You have to try them.

00:37:21.093 --> 00:37:22.636
You always come with food.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.679
I feel bad.

00:37:23.763 --> 00:37:24.972
It's fine.

00:37:25.056 --> 00:37:26.891
I'll get going if that's all.

00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:29.018
-Oh, Ms. Chou, wait.
-Yes?

00:37:36.192 --> 00:37:37.401
Here.

00:37:37.485 --> 00:37:41.364
Here's your pay
for the last two weeks of cleaning.

00:37:41.864 --> 00:37:42.948
Thank you.

00:37:43.616 --> 00:37:46.369
I'll be counting on you again next month.

00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:53.376
Hey.

00:37:53.876 --> 00:37:54.752
CHEN CHE-LI

00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:55.604
Hang on.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.606
Let me get something.

00:38:58.566 --> 00:39:00.860
What is it?

00:39:00.943 --> 00:39:03.237
Our clothes are still on,
and you're getting a condom?

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.242
Only a fool would get
such a buzzkill right now.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:29.633
Fuck you.

00:41:29.717 --> 00:41:31.176
That damn idiot, Fan Wei-ting.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.014
How many times have I said it?
Don't look at the camera!

00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:37.099
He keeps looking at it.

00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:43.689
Give this to Ming

00:41:44.273 --> 00:41:46.567
to blur Fan Wei-ting's face.

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:48.402
If there's no problem,

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.488
upload it, and let's make money, okay?

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.324
Okay, no problem. I'll handle it.

00:41:55.618 --> 00:41:56.619
-Hi, Hsiang.
-Hey.

00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:57.995
Ouyang, here.

00:41:58.078 --> 00:41:59.496
Thanks.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.914
Come on.

00:42:00.998 --> 00:42:02.166
Where'd you get this?

00:42:02.249 --> 00:42:03.917
She couldn't pay her debt.

00:42:04.001 --> 00:42:05.961
Mr. Chien asked if we'd take it for 50.

00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:07.963
Fifty?

00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:09.381
Expensive.

00:42:12.718 --> 00:42:13.844
What are you looking at?

00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:14.803
Strip.

00:42:15.387 --> 00:42:17.514
Hurry. Do you want me to do it for you?

00:42:18.015 --> 00:42:19.558
Take them off, hurry.

00:42:24.813 --> 00:42:25.689
Show your ID.

00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:27.983
Higher, do you hear me?

00:42:28.942 --> 00:42:29.777
Fuck.

00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:32.321
-Haven't I seen this girl before?
-Yeah.

00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:37.242
-Our high school classmate?
-Right.

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:39.244
-From the dance class.
-Right!

00:42:40.245 --> 00:42:42.039
Nothing beats familiarity.

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:43.499
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:42:46.418 --> 00:42:47.252
Hey.

00:42:47.878 --> 00:42:50.381
If we take this one,

00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:52.633
how much do you think
we can squeeze from her?

00:42:53.217 --> 00:42:55.302
She was our classmate. Why talk money?

00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:56.804
That would be so hurtful.

00:43:04.937 --> 00:43:07.356
You're so naughty!

00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:10.150
Fuck.

00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:20.035
RED ANT TRANSPORTATION COMPANY

00:43:32.881 --> 00:43:36.343
RED ANT FLEET

00:43:39.513 --> 00:43:40.347
Excuse me.

00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:42.599
I took one of your cabs yesterday.

00:43:42.683 --> 00:43:44.643
I think I left my phone in the car.

00:43:45.227 --> 00:43:47.229
Could you help me contact the driver?

00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:50.733
Sure. Do you know
the plate number or the driver's name?

00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:54.653
Here's the plate number. Take a look.

00:43:55.529 --> 00:43:58.699
Do you remember
around what time you took the cab?

00:43:59.408 --> 00:44:02.369
Around 10:00 p.m. or so.

00:44:02.453 --> 00:44:03.537
10:00 p.m.

00:44:04.747 --> 00:44:08.667
This is indeed the plate number
for one of our cabs driven by Mr. Chiang.

00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:12.004
But is there any chance
you got the wrong plate number?

00:44:12.087 --> 00:44:16.383
Mr. Chiang usually picks his daughter up
from work around this time.

00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:18.510
I doubt he would've accepted customers.

00:52:10.357 --> 00:52:15.362
