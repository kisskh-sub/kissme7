00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:13.785
Hey, Pin-yu.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.617
Yun-chen.

00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:58.663
I'm sorry.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.041
Did I make you wait long?

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:12.135
Not at all.

00:01:23.563 --> 00:01:24.522
Hsiao-tung.

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:27.483
Let's go.

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:03.329
Mom.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.095
I'm sorry.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.890
I'm sorry.

00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:37.900
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.697
Did you like the snack
I brought last time?

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:44.365
Was it too sweet?

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:48.411
No.

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:49.912
It was delicious.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.501
I wonder if visitation
is allowed on Christmas.

00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:59.505
If it is…

00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:03.843
we can spend Christmas together.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.012
Even if visitation is allowed,

00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:07.597
you don't

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.558
have to come see me that day.

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.230
Why?

00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:18.983
Isn't

00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:23.029
Christmas meant to be joyful?

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:26.032
I don't want you…

00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:29.577
to be sad that day.

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:32.205
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.248
What are you talking about?

00:06:34.832 --> 00:06:38.085
I would only be sad
if I couldn't see you, okay?

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.170
But even if we met…

00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:43.257
would you feel any better?

00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:47.512
Right now,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.265
just being able to look into your eyes

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:54.393
and hear your voice

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:58.981
makes me… happy.

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:01.526
But then

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:04.904
waiting to see you again

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.866
feels tougher and longer.

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:14.664
While I hope time can go by faster,

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:17.083
I'm scared it will fly by.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.963
I'm… afraid of dying

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:24.173
the day before we're supposed to meet.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:27.760
I'm afraid of making you sad.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.180
The last thing I want to see now…

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:36.310
is you being sad.

00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:39.605
Stop coming here.

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:44.068
Stop wasting time on me.

00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:48.656
The only thing I want to do now

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:51.826
is to make you happy.

00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:54.870
But…

00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.041
I can't do that at all.

00:08:04.088 --> 00:08:04.964
So at least

00:08:06.549 --> 00:08:08.676
don't be sad because of me.

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:11.929
Okay?

00:08:26.402 --> 00:08:28.070
Is that why…

00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:32.950
you refuse to have a lawyer
request a retrial?

00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:36.537
I read the information Pin-yu found.

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:39.123
It says

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:44.670
many death row inmates file for retrials

00:08:44.754 --> 00:08:47.173
to delay execution.

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:50.301
But you haven't.

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:53.804
You won't let anyone else
file one for you either.

00:08:55.723 --> 00:08:56.891
Why?

00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:03.022
Do you think
I'm wasting my time by visiting you?

00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:07.568
Hsiao-tung.

00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:10.946
I was never innocent.

00:09:13.282 --> 00:09:14.659
I killed many people.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.332
I deserve the death penalty.

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:33.219
How can you go back on your word?

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.640
You said whatever happens,

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:40.851
you would always be with me.

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.646
You wouldn't let go of my hand easily.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.566
Have you forgotten all that?

00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.571
Even if this is
the only way we can meet now,

00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:57.159
at least I know you're here,

00:09:57.243 --> 00:09:58.994
and you haven't left me all alone.

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:05.000
As long as I'm allowed to visit,
I'll come.

00:10:06.502 --> 00:10:08.170
I'll come every single time.

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:12.258
I'll come on Christmas too.

00:10:13.217 --> 00:10:16.554
Don't call it a waste of time again.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.981
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:16.483
Let me ask again.

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:21.196
Are you sure
you want to use our documentary

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.118
to share everything you've been through
with the public?

00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:31.498
I'm sure.

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:36.253
Although I can't change
what has already happened,

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:41.550
if I'm willing to speak about it
so that more people understand Li Jen-yao,

00:13:42.968 --> 00:13:44.762
maybe there's a chance…

00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:49.224
to reduce his sentence.

00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:52.603
But Li Jen-yao's death sentence
has been finalized.

00:13:53.938 --> 00:13:56.732
Is this really going to change anything?

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:38.190
I'm sorry, Ta-wei.

00:14:38.273 --> 00:14:40.359
Let's take a break.

00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:49.326
It's me, Yu. I'll speak for Hsiao-tung
since she can't do it.

00:14:50.035 --> 00:14:52.955
Although getting the public
to understand Li Jen-yao

00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:55.582
will not suffice
to get an appeal or a retrial,

00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:58.210
we can use Chiang Hsiao-tung's interview

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:00.212
to sway public opinion.

00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:03.841
She can then convince Li Jen-yao
to let a lawyer help

00:15:03.924 --> 00:15:06.635
and file an extraordinary appeal
or something.

00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:10.556
Maybe there's a chance
it could delay his execution.

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:12.558
But…

00:15:15.894 --> 00:15:17.146
In that case,

00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:20.232
everyone would be talking about

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.109
Chiang Hsiao-tung's rape again.

00:15:22.818 --> 00:15:27.197
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung
mentally prepared to face all that?

00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:29.575
Look, when she was speaking,

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:31.452
didn't you get the feeling

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:34.997
she still has the maturity of a teenager?

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.793
Are you sure
she can really handle all this?

00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:46.717
Anyway, we've decided
to cancel production.

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:49.094
Um, so naturally,

00:15:49.595 --> 00:15:51.805
there's no investment anymore.

00:15:52.306 --> 00:15:55.100
Uh, we're terminating our arrangement.

00:15:57.603 --> 00:15:58.812
Do whatever you want.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.275
I just want to know

00:16:03.984 --> 00:16:06.945
if Li Jen-yao told you anything about…

00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:12.409
my son?

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:15.370
Uh,

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:17.206
no.

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:18.499
Honestly,

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:21.210
we're canceling production

00:16:21.293 --> 00:16:24.046
mostly because he wouldn't say
anything about the case,

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.800
including how the conflict
with your son started

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.052
or why he killed him.

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.887
He never said a word.

00:16:42.147 --> 00:16:43.232
Okay, then,

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.442
I'll let you get some rest.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:56.245
Mrs. Ouyang.

00:16:56.954 --> 00:16:58.497
I'll be honest.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:00.415
You should be relieved

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:02.376
we canceled production.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.879
Based on the information I gathered,

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.714
I personally believe

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:11.176
that neither your son nor you

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.388
are as innocent as everyone says.

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:17.266
Right?

00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:27.734
We'll be going.

00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:31.989
DIAMOND SUTRA

00:17:38.954 --> 00:17:41.248
-Hey, Hsu Ta-wei, what was that?
-Huh?

00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.084
Why didn't you give me a heads-up
about something so important?

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:47.838
Hasn't Chiang Hsiao-tung agreed
to let us interview her

00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:51.550
so that she could use this documentary
to delay Li Jen-yao's execution?

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.095
If we cancel the film,
what's Li Jen-yao going to do?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.015
Yeah, I know.

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:02.436
I saw Li Jen-yao
before meeting this old bat today.

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:04.730
You met Li Jen-yao?

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:08.901
No matter what I asked,

00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:13.614
he insisted that what he did
had nothing to do with Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:16.033
Although he won't say it,

00:18:16.116 --> 00:18:18.410
it's so obvious

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.537
that, even now,

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:23.123
he's still doing his best
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:25.292
Think about it.

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:27.669
If Chiang Hsiao-tung's story

00:18:27.753 --> 00:18:29.755
becomes known to the public

00:18:29.838 --> 00:18:33.050
because of our documentary, what happens?

00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:39.014
Li Jen-yao might be able
to delay his death sentence.

00:18:39.681 --> 00:18:42.559
But the media won't leave
Chiang Hsiao-tung alone.

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:43.852
Not just the media.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:46.271
Everyone will come after her.

00:18:46.355 --> 00:18:49.024
Her video will resurface.

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:52.486
The animosity that drove her to despair

00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:54.821
will rear its ugly head again.

00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:57.074
Should a victim have to endure that?

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.876
Hey, you didn't happen to say no

00:19:08.794 --> 00:19:10.295
to that commercial project,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.589
did you?

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.594
I'll take it.

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:21.098
Fuck this Li Jen-yao project.

00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.474
What a waste of money.

00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:25.352
I'll sort it out.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.578
Did he really say that?

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:45.163
Yes.

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.249
In his statement,

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.459
Li Jen-yao said

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.963
he heard the door open
at the time of the murder.

00:19:54.423 --> 00:19:56.133
Based on your statement,

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:58.135
it matches when you came home.

00:19:58.885 --> 00:20:03.265
That means you arrived home
when he was committing the murder.

00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:07.185
To stop your son from crying out for help,

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:08.979
he covered his mouth and nose

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:11.606
until he died from suffocation.

00:20:39.676 --> 00:20:41.470
There's one thing

00:20:42.554 --> 00:20:44.473
I want to ask you.

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:48.143
What is it?

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.481
You know what I want to ask.

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:37.359
Hurry.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.195
Hurry.

00:21:40.695 --> 00:21:42.739
Hurry.

00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:45.742
You're the most useless, you know?

00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:51.581
Why didn't you kill him?

00:21:52.082 --> 00:21:53.375
Speak.

00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:56.461
You're the most useless!

00:21:57.796 --> 00:22:00.507
It's all because of you! You're useless!

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:02.843
You're trash!

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:04.219
Mom!

00:22:19.192 --> 00:22:20.193
Be good.

00:22:21.778 --> 00:22:23.238
Hang in there.

00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:26.283
It'll stop hurting soon.

00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:33.707
Speak.

00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:35.542
Answer me!

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.751
Whose fault is it?

00:22:37.252 --> 00:22:39.087
It's all because of you, isn't it?

00:22:39.588 --> 00:22:41.214
You're looking down on me!

00:22:41.715 --> 00:22:44.217
What are you looking at? Speak.

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:45.802
Speak!

00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:48.221
I turned out this way

00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:49.806
because of you.

00:22:50.307 --> 00:22:51.933
It's all because of you.

00:22:52.434 --> 00:22:54.394
It's all because of you!

00:23:12.954 --> 00:23:13.955
Be good.

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:18.919
It's over now.

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:28.803
Come here.

00:23:36.603 --> 00:23:37.854
It's over now.

00:23:40.941 --> 00:23:42.150
It's over now.

00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:23.608
That's how it's hummed, right?

00:24:25.193 --> 00:24:26.695
You saw everything.

00:24:28.572 --> 00:24:29.406
Then why…

00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.663
Because it's better this way.

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.418
What could hurt more

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.838
than ruining your most precious baby

00:24:46.673 --> 00:24:50.468
and living in fear every day?

00:25:38.725 --> 00:25:41.478
OUYANG HSIANG

00:25:41.561 --> 00:25:44.064
I, Ouyang Hsiang,

00:25:44.147 --> 00:25:47.692
speak for all the victims' families

00:25:48.193 --> 00:25:49.986
when I say our ruling party…

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.154
ENFORCE DEATH PENALTY BY LAW

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:53.573
…is, in essence,
an accomplice of serial killer Li Jen-yao!

00:25:53.657 --> 00:25:55.742
How long has it been since his sentence?

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:58.328
Why hasn't he been executed yet?

00:25:58.411 --> 00:26:00.413
Has he asked for a constitutional review?

00:26:00.997 --> 00:26:02.666
Has he asked for a retrial?

00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:05.835
Has he filed an extraordinary appeal?

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.045
No.

00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:10.799
In that case,
I want to ask the Ministry of Justice

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:14.678
why you haven't carried out
his death sentence?

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.642
I'm asking the ruling party
to bring justice to the victims' families!

00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:34.948
1027.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.752
Here. Someone sent you a Christmas gift.

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:53.508
We were meant to remove the wrapping.

00:26:53.591 --> 00:26:56.219
But after I checked the package,
I wrapped it up again.

00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:58.638
So you'd get to unwrap a gift.

00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:01.099
Keep this between us.

00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:03.226
Merry Christmas.

00:27:05.061 --> 00:27:05.895
Thank you.

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:24.330
Li Jen-yao.

00:28:10.752 --> 00:28:12.504
The execution is in three hours.

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:21.763
I know.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.769
What are they thinking?

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:29.354
Why did they choose today?

00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:35.985
What do you want to eat? We'll prepare it.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.126
I'd like to listen to a song.

00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:21.257
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.993
1027, LI JEN-YAO

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.596
TO LI JEN-YAO

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.098
JEN-YAO, MERRY CHRISTMAS!

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:55.184
HERE'S TO OUR FIRST AND NEXT ONE TOGETHER!
HSIAO-TUNG

00:31:55.268 --> 00:31:57.603
1027, LI JEN-YAO

00:31:59.564 --> 00:32:01.816
The execution was carried out
at 2:32 p.m. today.

00:32:02.316 --> 00:32:04.569
The confirmed time of death is 2:49 p.m.

00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:10.825
Murderer Li Jen-yao brutally took away
others' right to life,

00:32:10.908 --> 00:32:12.702
including that of a child,

00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:14.746
which is enshrined in the CRC.

00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:19.000
Deputy Chief, was the sudden execution
driven by the recent press conference

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.210
where Legislator Ouyang
and victims' families

00:32:21.294 --> 00:32:23.129
demanded it to be carried out?

00:32:23.212 --> 00:32:24.464
Was this a political move?

00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:28.426
The decision to execute was primarily
influenced by the criminal's motives,

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.969
his methods,

00:32:30.053 --> 00:32:33.347
the harm caused to victims
and their families,

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:35.850
and the risk to public safety.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.935
It was carried out lawfully.

00:32:38.644 --> 00:32:39.854
Hsiao-tung.

00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:00.823
Jen-yao.

00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:06.370
We're home.

00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:44.283
Jen-yao.

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:50.289
You had it rough.

00:37:58.798 --> 00:38:00.466
I'm sorry.

00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:06.514
Remember,

00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:08.766
for your next life,

00:38:10.017 --> 00:38:14.438
choose carefully.

00:38:17.149 --> 00:38:20.277
Make sure to choose a better mom.

00:38:38.003 --> 00:38:39.672
Don't pick someone…

00:38:43.008 --> 00:38:46.178
don't pick someone like me.

00:38:47.012 --> 00:38:48.514
Do you understand?

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.102
Mrs. Li.

00:40:19.855 --> 00:40:22.066
Can I take Jen-yao somewhere?

00:40:33.244 --> 00:40:35.246
The three of us said we'd come back.

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:37.623
Today we did.

00:40:41.335 --> 00:40:43.754
You must have been pretty bored
these past few years.

00:40:45.965 --> 00:40:48.634
I brought you here to listen to the waves.

00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:19.433
Li Jen-yao wrote you this letter
after the first time you met him

00:42:20.476 --> 00:42:21.435
as Pin-yu.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.009
He told me to give it to you

00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:57.346
if you ever remember him.

00:42:59.598 --> 00:43:00.432
To be honest,

00:43:01.517 --> 00:43:03.227
I wanted to throw it away.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.440
But I hesitated for a long time.

00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:14.822
I think only you have the right
to decide if you want to read it.

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:33.465
Infamous death row inmate Li Jen-yao
was executed for multiple murders,

00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:38.554
including that of his own father
and an innocent child.

00:43:39.346 --> 00:43:41.974
People were generally
in favor of his execution.

00:43:42.057 --> 00:43:45.686
Almost 80% of the Taiwanese population
still support the death penalty after all.

00:43:46.186 --> 00:43:49.356
However, Li Jen-yao's execution
was carried out very suddenly,

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.358
leading to speculation

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:54.653
that the death penalty
was used as a political tool.

00:43:54.737 --> 00:43:56.280
While the debate was ongoing,

00:43:56.363 --> 00:43:59.867
on April 5th, an anonymous post appeared.

00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:01.577
It was titled

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.413
"Thank You, Li Jen-yao,
for Killing Those Monsters."

00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:07.833
Wow. The post sparked
heated discussions online.

00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:10.335
The person who shared it was a victim.

00:44:10.419 --> 00:44:14.298
She wrote in great detail
about how three of Li Jen-yao's victims,

00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:17.426
Ouyang Ti, Wang Yu-hsiang, Fan Wei-ting,

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:20.012
with Ouyang Ti as the mastermind,

00:44:20.095 --> 00:44:25.017
used various illegal means
to control and coerce dozens of women

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.102
into becoming their sex slaves.

00:44:27.186 --> 00:44:30.314
They used indecent videos
and photos to threaten victims

00:44:30.397 --> 00:44:33.984
and even force them to appear in sex tapes
and engage in prostitution.

00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:37.070
To make it worse,
some were controlled with drugs.

00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:41.074
The victim who posted this said
she was underage at the time.

00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:43.368
But since Ouyang Ti
was the son of a politician

00:44:43.452 --> 00:44:45.287
and Wang Yu-hsiang was a rich heir,

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.331
she didn't dare speak out.

00:44:47.414 --> 00:44:49.792
After hearing of their murders,

00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.586
she felt truly free at last.

00:44:52.669 --> 00:44:55.297
The heart-wrenching post
stirred public sympathy

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.090
and led to an official investigation,

00:44:57.174 --> 00:45:01.220
which uncovered
over 60 additional female victims.

00:45:01.303 --> 00:45:04.014
The news has sparked outrage online,

00:45:04.097 --> 00:45:06.475
and the public
is now turning its attention

00:45:06.558 --> 00:45:09.311
to Ouyang Ti's father,
who's still involved in politics,

00:45:09.394 --> 00:45:10.521
Ouyang Hsiang.

00:45:11.772 --> 00:45:13.982
There he is.

00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:16.527
-Were you aware of what your son did?
-Any comment?

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:17.611
Did you know the victims…

00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:18.946
Did you know he sold drugs?

00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:21.114
-How do you feel?
-Any words for the victims?

00:45:21.198 --> 00:45:22.741
…secretly film sex tapes?

00:45:22.825 --> 00:45:25.077
-Sir, can you respond? Excuse me.
-Please explain.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.468

Time of death, 12:25 p.m.,

here at the hospital.

00:46:36.565 --> 00:46:39.818
Another passion project?

00:46:39.902 --> 00:46:42.112
We might as well just close the studio.

00:46:42.195 --> 00:46:44.406
This is different. We'll make a profit.

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:46.992
How is it different?
You bleed money every time.

00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:49.036
Oh, come on.
Please give me another chance.

TRASH DUTY, HSU TA-WEI

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.204
How about this?

00:46:51.288 --> 00:46:53.540
If we lose money,
I'll be your assistant director forever.

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:56.376
No, wait, that's way too much.

00:46:56.877 --> 00:46:59.379
Hey, just imagine this.

00:46:59.463 --> 00:47:00.297
Forget it.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.216
Our society could use
more passion, sunshine, and positivity.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.177
-Tickets, please.
-This way.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.846
Ticket, please. Odd numbers to the right.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.475
JOINT DANCE SHOWCASE, NEW TAIPEI CITY

00:47:11.558 --> 00:47:12.684
There she is.

00:47:15.729 --> 00:47:16.813
Come on.

00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.192
Hey, why are your hands sweaty?

00:47:20.275 --> 00:47:21.693
I'm nervous.

00:47:21.777 --> 00:47:23.654
Why? You're not the one dancing.

00:47:23.737 --> 00:47:25.238
Hsiao-tung hasn't danced in ages…

00:47:25.822 --> 00:47:27.991
What's wrong with you? Can't I be nervous?

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:30.077
Oh, fine, you're nervous. Come on.

00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:41.838
Over there.

00:47:55.102 --> 00:47:57.479
Most of the audience is seated.
Dancers, stand by.

00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:01.692
Pin-yu, get ready to go on stage.

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:24.055
How is your new job going?

00:53:24.639 --> 00:53:26.099
It's okay.

00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:28.101
There's a lot of trivial work.

00:53:29.269 --> 00:53:31.813
I manage the fan club, answer calls,

00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:33.315
and write press releases.

00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:34.941
Oh, I edit videos too.

00:53:35.525 --> 00:53:39.612
When there's a performance,
I help out a lot backstage.

00:53:40.113 --> 00:53:41.948
I feel exhausted every day.

00:53:42.032 --> 00:53:45.410
Things were way easier
when I could just practice dancing.

00:53:48.496 --> 00:53:49.914
-Hey.
-Hmm?

00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:52.834
Are you really not going to keep dancing?

00:53:59.841 --> 00:54:00.675
No, I'm not.

00:54:01.593 --> 00:54:04.471
I enrolled in the adult ballet class

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.431
just so that

00:54:07.307 --> 00:54:09.184
I could fulfill a promise.

00:54:22.113 --> 00:54:23.823
Hey, Hsiao-tung, I have news.

00:54:24.324 --> 00:54:25.325
What is it?

00:54:26.659 --> 00:54:28.453
My mom passed the bar on to me.

00:54:28.536 --> 00:54:29.704
She's retiring.

00:54:31.164 --> 00:54:34.042
I'm renovating it
to make it look the way I want.

00:54:34.125 --> 00:54:35.460
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:54:35.543 --> 00:54:37.504
So what do you want it to look like?

00:54:40.256 --> 00:54:41.132
Not sure yet.

00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:44.761
But I want to become a barista.

00:54:44.844 --> 00:54:46.054
I'm taking a course.

00:54:48.598 --> 00:54:50.767
Come to my place next week
and be my guinea pig?

00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:53.895
Sure.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.275
I'll go get some drinks.

00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:00.443
What do you want?

00:55:03.071 --> 00:55:05.198
Anything is fine.
I'll have whatever you get.

00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:06.241
Okay.

00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:17.742
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:59:24.707 --> 00:59:25.833
You made it.

00:59:26.334 --> 00:59:27.210
Finally.

00:59:31.964 --> 00:59:33.883
We said we'd spend Christmas together.

00:59:33.966 --> 00:59:35.093
Remember?

00:59:36.511 --> 00:59:37.595
I do.

00:59:37.679 --> 00:59:38.888
Your first task.

00:59:39.681 --> 00:59:40.765
Put it up there.

01:01:29.457 --> 01:01:33.127
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW NEEDS SUPPORT,
THERE IS HELP.

01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:35.087
YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

01:01:35.171 --> 01:01:39.383
BELOW YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION
AND RESOURCES ON HOW TO GET HELP.

01:01:46.557 --> 01:01:47.517
Li Jen-yao!

01:05:58.350 --> 01:05:59.518
Lame!

01:06:51.862 --> 01:06:53.197
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:00.371
What now?

01:07:00.454 --> 01:07:01.705
Have you seen a ghost?

01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:03.332
Imagine this is Alice Ko.

01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:04.917
-Imagine her face.
-Right.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.293
We didn't switch shots.

01:07:06.377 --> 01:07:08.170
I'll hand her over to you.

01:07:44.415 --> 01:07:45.416
We're on TV.

01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:55.467
I'm out of breath.

01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:36.967
Stop it! Stop.

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.093
Here.

01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:05.704
It's a wrap!

01:09:05.788 --> 01:09:09.625
