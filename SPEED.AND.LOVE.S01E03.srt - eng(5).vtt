00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530
Do you remember what a navigator is?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.810
As a racer,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.440
you need to be aware of
your car's condition and road conditions

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.370
at all times.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.590
This is the radiator.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.910
This is the oil dipstick.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.710
What do you hear?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.090
Bubbling sounds.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.060
Bubbles?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.350
Mu,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020
sit in the passenger seat.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.590
Be my navigator.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.880
Left!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.630
Forward! Go!

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.880
I remember.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.470
I need your help now.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.790
The password is 1120.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.440
Open the digital app.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.030
Find the pinned
group location information.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.290
Tell me the direction.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.890
They crashed behind us.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.070
What should we do?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.880
Which way?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.560
They crashed behind us!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.840
Tell me the route.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.160
Be careful.
About 800 meters ahead there's...

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.560
I don't know what that is.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.190
There are three possible roads nearby.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.560
The distances are similar.
The road conditions...

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.360
I can't see the road conditions.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.030
Choose one.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.750
When we reach the east side,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.150
make a sharp 90-degree turn
into the second curve.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.410
I'll follow your lead.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.930
There's a fork ahead. Turn right.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.110
Brandy?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.620
Didn't he say he wasn't coming today?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.170
Listen to me now.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.440
After this curve,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.070
I'll count down from five.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.440
Then you grab the steering wheel.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.190
How?

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.320
With your hands.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.480
Five.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.270
Four.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.160
Jin Zhao, look!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.880
Three.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.950
Two.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.000
One.

Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.770
I didn't plan to come,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.190
but Wan Shengbang's little minions

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.680
came at me like rabid dogs

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.610
and forced me onto the track.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.410

to the alliance.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.590
I've told you

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.910
that we don't allow outsiders here.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.669
She's not an outsider.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.080
She's my girlfriend.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.320
Girlfriend?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.720
Yes.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.070
She recently suspected
I'm seeing someone else

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.030
because I disappear every night.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.200
If I didn't bring her along,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.400
she would've broken up with me tonight.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.140
Are you still mad at me?

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.910
I can't believe it.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.120
Brandy, you're completely wrapped around

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.200
this little girl's finger.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.660
One mention of breaking up
and you've caved.

I can't dote on her enough.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.850
How can I break up with her?

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.560

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.030
When Jin Qiang and I first came here,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.150
we had nowhere to live.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.350
We rented a basement.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.990
No windows, no light.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.720
Day was just like night.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.880
Every time it rained,

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.630
it would flood up to our legs.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.790
Homework, backpacks, mattresses...

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.670
They'd all be submerged.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.070
Even the dead rats
would float in the water!

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.170
We had to put tables together to sleep on.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.150
Then the next day,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.480
we'd scoop the water out bucket by bucket.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.240
Later, someone referred Jin Qiang

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.640
to do some earthwork job.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.320
It required a referral fee.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.050
Jin Qiang gave all his money
to that person.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.790
That person's phone number
immediately became disconnected.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.390
We couldn't even afford
the basement anymore.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.160
I had to sleep on the streets,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.880
on pedestrian bridges,
in underground passages,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.010
and you tell me money isn't important?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.280
Later...

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.920
He finally found a reliable job.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.640
He worked as a chef in a restaurant.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.090
That's where he met Zhao Meijuan.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.780
It was Zhao Meijuan's first marriage

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.480
and Jin Qiang's second.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.280
He had no money

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.660
and was raising me.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.280
The two of them scraped together
enough money

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.480
to open a restaurant.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.200
They worked from dawn till dusk,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.700
but their earnings
barely covered the rent.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.650
Whenever school asked for tuition fees,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.330
I could only stand at their door

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.790
with the payment slip in my hand.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.360
It was just two or three hundred bucks,

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.980
but I couldn't bring myself to ask.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.050
Do you think money isn't important?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.950
Jin Xin needs surgery.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.700
It's congenital heart disease.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.470
Besides the surgery costs,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.990
there are also expensive treatment fees.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.520
Jin Qiang is already broke.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.150
This is just
adding insult to the injury for him.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.430
For money, he even...

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.280
What do you think I should do?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.750
Stand by and watch him suffer?

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.390
Jin Qiang never gave up on me,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.250
even in the most difficult times.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.770
Should I turn my back

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.490
on your dad?

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.190
Does Mom...

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.520
know about all this?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.850
What difference does it make if she knows?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.340
What difference does it make
if she doesn't?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.220
They're divorced.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.600
Even so,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.970
you shouldn't be

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.630
doing such dangerous things.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.910
If it makes money, it's worth doing.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.100
What's wrong with living on the edge?

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.190
If I'm dead,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.440
why does it matter if I'm on the edge?

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.240
Jin Zhao,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.590
why won't you take the right path,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.210
instead of going down this dark alleyway?

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:27.090
Let go.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.150
No.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.280
Do you think

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.540
no one in this world
can keep you in check?

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.720
You want to keep me in check?

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.950
By what right?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.140
Are you still a Jin?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.880
You've even changed your surname.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.360
If you've forgotten your surname,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.620
then let me remind you.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.880
Jiang...

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.000
Mu.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.910
So...

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.040
This is why you won't come back

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.760
to see us, right?

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.430
You blame Mom.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.090
You blame her
for leaving Dad with nothing.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.470
You hate her,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.360
don't you?

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.430
Okay.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.660
Zhao Meijuan called me.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.710
Go back.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.880
I won't.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.350
What will it take for you to go back?

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.480
Promise me first.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.470
Promise you what?

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.150
Promise me you'll find a real job

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.210
and stop this crap.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.180
Otherwise,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.250
neither of us will go back tonight.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.320
You...

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.560
Brother.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.370
Let's go home.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.910
What did you say?

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.690
I'll take you home.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.910
What home?

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.910
I don't have a home.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.430
You do.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.190
The old house in Nanjing

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.710
that we used to live in.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.980
You're not going to Canada anymore?

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.840
Nope.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.210
I've made up my mind.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.800
I'm going to take you back to China,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.710
to Nanjing.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.970
From now on, we'll live together

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.250
in that old house,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.360
never to be separated again, okay?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.080
I can make money.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.470
I'm capable.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.730
I can give you a stable life.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.150
When we go back,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.990
you can continue your studies

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.950
and your writing.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.800
I won't let you fight anymore,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.960
and I won't let you be in pain.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:00.940
From now on,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.320
I'll protect you.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:10.600
Trust me.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.030
I can definitely do it.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.170
Brother,

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.110
let's go back.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.150
I can't go back.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:08.990
You can't control him.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.320
Yes,

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.320
you couldn't beat him in the ring.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.110
I accept that,

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.960
and I'll put up with it.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.250
But how can your driving skills
be worse than his too?

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.550
There won't be a next time.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.240
There won't be a next time!

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.800
There won't be a next time!

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.970
Get lost!

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.360
Thank you.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.560
Jin Qiang called.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.660
He said your mom arrived in Manshi.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.970
Let me take you there.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.910
Okay.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.150
Do you...

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.800
want to say hello?

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.560
No.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:45.670
Go ahead.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:00.190
Mu,

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.670
actually, your Uncle Chris

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.040
cares about you very much.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.770
He's already arranged
a school for you in Canada.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.230
You can continue your studies

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.600
and further education there.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600
I won't go.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.290
If not Canada, then where will you go?

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.490
I've already decided.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.650
After graduating, I'll stay in China.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.050
I won't go anywhere else.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.230
This time, come back with me.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.160
Put everything aside for now

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.890
and pass the IELTS exam, okay?

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.300
I won't pass it.
I don't want to go abroad.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.760
I've said that I'll stay

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.910
in that old house in Nanjing.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.710
I don't want to go anywhere else.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.760
I'm planning on selling

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.430
the house in Nanjing.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.430
Why would you sell a perfectly fine house?

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.630
I've already married your Uncle Chris.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.910
He has many properties
and businesses there.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.340
I've decided to settle down with him
in Canada.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.470
That's also where I plan on retiring to.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.710
So, why would I keep

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.910
a house in China?

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.080
It's useless.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.190
How is it useless?

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.440
Why do you trust him so much?

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.360
Aren't you afraid that one day he might—

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:53.900
Mu!

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.150
Well...

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.130
I'll go check on things.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.390
Mom,

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.040
how can you sell the house?

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.910
Have you thought about

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.430
if things don't work out
between you two in the future?

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.430
Where will you live when you come back?

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.710
Whether I sell the house or not,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.040
I'll never abandon you.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.910
No matter if you settle abroad

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.190
or live in China,

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.800
I'll set aside
a large sum of money for you.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.230
This isn't something
for you to worry about,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.880
okay?

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.290
Do you think I'm worried about money?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.230
I'm worried about you being deceived.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.950
Enough.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.810
I don't want you

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.390
to say such things again.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.800
This topic ends here.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.520
Is that Jin Zhao?

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.190
Didn't he leave?

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.730
Why did he come back?

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.760
Could it be...

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.280
He wanted to see...

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.280
Mom?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.390
How does he know we're staying here?

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.670
He drove me here.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.310
What?

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.280
He brought you here?

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.430
Your father promised me

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.430
that when you came this time,

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.690
you two wouldn't meet!

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.630
Why?

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.410
Why can't we see each other?

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.190
Mu, you're grown up now.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:46.560
Shouldn't you keep some distance

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.820
from the opposite sex?

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.720
You'd better not see each other too often.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.750
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.080
He's Jin Zhao.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.390
I've told you repeatedly

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.990
about Jin Zhao's situation.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.880
You are not related by blood.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.590
You're not siblings.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.880
He's not your brother.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.430
I've made myself perfectly clear already.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.690
Don't you understand?

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:06.760
Besides,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.610
he's not even a good person now.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.120
You can't talk about him like that.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.320
Even if we're not related by blood,

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.580
he's still my brother.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.630
Back then, your father insisted on
bringing him home.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.950
I was against it,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360
but your father was stubborn

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.600
and insisted.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:23.950
I already said

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.040
this child
would be difficult to discipline.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.630
Bold as brass,

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.040
he's bound to get into trouble someday.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.310
Back then,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.230
he called our home repeatedly.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.960
I had warned him already.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.600
I didn't want you two associating.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.300
How could you understand?

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.320
If you understood,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:49.710
you wouldn't have stayed away

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.970
for so many years without seeing me once.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320
What did you say?

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.360
He'd called me?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.850
What did you warn him about?

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.440
What could I warn him about?

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.910
I told him to be sensible,
follow the rules,

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.240
and stop pestering you.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.470
After you started middle school,
you weren't little anymore.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.230
Shouldn't he keep his distance?

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.840
You think it's still like
when you were children,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.770
talking about sibling affection?

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.470
So...

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.640
This is the real reason
you didn't come back to see us,

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.040
right?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.040
Master.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.060
I'm not in the mood
to play with you right now.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.970
We didn't finish our fight yesterday.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.080
I said,

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.500
I'm not in the mood
to play with you right now.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.210
I'm the one beaten up.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.170
Why are you crying?

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.110
I've told you repeatedly

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.710
about Jin Zhao's situation.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.590
You are not related by blood.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.310
You're not siblings.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.639
He's not your brother.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.380
What's wrong with living on the edge?

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.360
If I'm dead,

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.030
why does it matter if I'm on the edge?

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.960
You want to keep me in check?

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.110
By what right?

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.720
You've even changed your surname.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.080
If you've forgotten your surname,

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080
let me remind you.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.390
Jiang...

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.590
Mu.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:22.720
Our flight is this afternoon.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.980
I hope to see you there.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.420
I hope you'll think it through

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.440
and stop being so stubborn.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.430
Brother,

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.280
you haven't called for so long.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.800
I don't know how to find you,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.990
so I can only try writing to you.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.510
I hope you receive it.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:26.690
Brother,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.550
are you in high school now?

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.520
I really want to know how you did
on your high school entrance exam.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.470
♪ Perhaps the weather's damp and mild ♪

I'm sure you did great.

Did you get into a key high school?

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.940

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.590
♪ Perhaps it's about the habit
of bearing ♪

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.990

Mom says we don't need

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.760

to a newly rented house.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.720
Once I know the address,

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:58.510

this is my last time writing to you,

because you've never written back.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.820
I feel like I'm writing to thin air.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.390
I'm starting middle school now.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.280
I'll have many new classmates
