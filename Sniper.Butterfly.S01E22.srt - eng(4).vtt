00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.690
(If the paperwork goes through,)

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:51.555
(you can head out
when sophomore year starts.)

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.530
(The exchange program lasts two years.)

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.222
(You're still young.)

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:57.040
(You really should)

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.250
(get out more,)

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230
(and open up your mind)

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.050
(and your horizons.)

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.810
(It will help you a lot.)

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.130
Just you?

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.970
Li Wu.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.130
Seriously, what are the odds?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280
My mom just helped me apply

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.190
to a school in the US,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.690
and you already got an exchange spot.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.100
Looks like I'm not going alone anymore.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.460
Oh, right.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.130
What do you think of this phone?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.900
Aren't you already using the newest one?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.290
Why buy another?

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.060
It is for Wen.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.520
She is still using

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.840
her old high school phone.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.290
The battery dies all the time.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.180
So I bought her a new one.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.680
Once I am in the US,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.180
it will make video calls easier.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.290
You two.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.120
Do you want to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.900
get some shaved ice?

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.470
Shaved ice?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.940
Yeah.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.730
Come on.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.570
You guys go ahead.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.690
I'll pass.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.620
Alright.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.940
We are heading out then.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.100
Let's go.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.010
(Are you busy?)

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.900
(A little.)

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.100
(What is it?)

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.130
(Can you come home for dinner tonight?)

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.220
(I will try.)

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.580
(Try?)

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.050
(Maybe?)

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.220
(Alright.)

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.700
- Jin, something is going on with you.
- Jin, something is going on with you.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.530
What do you mean?

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.630
You have been staring at your screen

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.680
and smiling

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.800
ever since a moment ago.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.933
And you look sneaky about it.

00:04:56.955 --> 00:04:58.100
We all saw it.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.290
I can't smile
while chatting with a friend?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.410
Let's look over the poster proposal.

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:06.310
I have plans tonight.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.600
I don't want to work overtime.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.870
I can't finish it anyway.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.490
I don't want to work overtime either.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.780
Then, hurry up.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.850
It smells so good.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.070
What is the occasion today?

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.220
This is a lot of food.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.270
I made everything you like to eat.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.370
Really?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.580
Here.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.360
Didn't you say

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.644
they were all things I like?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.560
I cut it as small as I could.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.610
You can hardly taste it.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.930
I don't want it.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.100
Give me a second.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.610
Pick them out cleanly

00:06:21.688 --> 00:06:23.155
or I won't have anything to eat.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.220
Okay.

00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:36.044
Is this okay now?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.170
Yes.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.260
What is this?

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.050
What is it?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.930
You cheat.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.340
Drink your soup.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.730
What?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.870
(Wen: Cheng Rui told me)

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.733
(you are going to Penn
as an exchange student.)

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.680
(Congrats.)

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.560
(You get to be)

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.610
(with Cheng Rui again.)

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.660
What is it?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.050
So...

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.370
There is a paper.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.490
It passed the journal review.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.140
That is amazing.

00:07:51.377 --> 00:07:52.340
What reward do you want?

00:07:56.955 --> 00:07:58.377
I want you to eat everything.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.360
Impossible.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.020
Pick another.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.050
I'll celebrate your birthday this year.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.850
My birthday?

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:09.422
We didn't spend it together last year.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.900
Such a pity.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.700
Let's do it this year.

00:08:16.822 --> 00:08:17.900
Come here for a second.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.830
So can I

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.050
look forward

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.850
to this year's gift?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.020
No?

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:29.900
Yes?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.340
Eat.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.500
(Phuket)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.700
Hello?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.060
Hello.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.200
Are you Li Wu's sister,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.940
Cen Jin?

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.490
I am.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.120
I am a teacher

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120
from Li Wu's school.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.088
My surname is Zhang.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.440
Do you have some time

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.130
to talk?

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.540
Yes.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.820
Drink a little.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.460
I am not drinking.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.080
Then why come to me

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.010
looking all gloomy?

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.510
I just met with

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.940
Li Wu's dean.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.340
His dean?

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.540
What happened?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.390
Your face is not the face

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.700
of someone who heard good news.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.080
Li Wu gave up

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.490
his exchange spot in the US.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.820
What?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.270
The school arranged

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.490
for him to go to Penn.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.940
He told the school he is not going.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.270
His dean

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.770
wants me to talk to him again,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.000
so he doesn't

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.250
give up the chance to go.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.630
This storyline sounds

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.700
a little familiar.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.080
It's just like the time

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.650
he changed his college preference.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.370
What are you going to do?

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.080
If I knew what to do,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.460
I would not be sitting here.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.730
Back then, he probably gave up

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.250
Huaqing for me too.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.910
He's about to refuse

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.060
another amazing opportunity.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.970
I feel like

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.320
my worst fear

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.370
is still happening.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.550
I've become

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.130
the person who's holding him back.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.180
But he's still so young.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.480
There's such a big world out there

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.377
waiting for him
to explore and experience.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.840
His life

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.100
shouldn't be only about love.

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:35.440
He shouldn't give things up

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.340
just because of me.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.730
Are you regretting it?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.010
What would you do if you were me?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.850
To be honest,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.670
I really don't know

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.800
what the right move is.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.840
First of all, I wouldn't

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.960
take on a responsibility

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.220
this big all by myself.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.540
I think you're overthinking.

00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.088
You think about him in everything.

00:11:03.088 --> 00:11:04.580
You're planning out his whole future.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.940
But when it comes to life,

00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:09.490
we can't walk
someone else's path for them.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.650
We also can't predict how it'll go.

00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:14.220
Have you ever thought about this?

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.010
Maybe Li Wu's willing to give up

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.720
that bigger world you talk about

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.130
because it's you.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.700
But if I'm like this,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.130
doesn't that make me selfish?

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.340
How are you selfish?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.580
You treat him so well.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.340
Yes, from your point of view,

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.630
it might look like he's losing

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.650
the chance
to see the world because of you.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.460
Maybe that feels selfish to you.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.030
But what about Li Wu?

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.100
Do you know how he feels?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.100
If he really loves you,

00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:53.390
he'll face everything in life

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.700
together with you.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.610
He'll face that bigger world too.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.490
Why don't you go talk to Li Wu?

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.960
Things aren't as

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.010
complicated as you think.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.390
I wish

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.180
it were that simple.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.100
Yeah.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360
It's always easier to talk

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.540
when it's someone else's life.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.600
I'm heading out.

00:12:29.222 --> 00:12:30.180
Where're you going?

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.490
To my parents' place.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.820
Take it slow then.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.130
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.240
You should've

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.000
invited Wu

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.060
to come over too.

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:46.770
I haven't seen him in so long.

00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:49.030
Last time,
he took such good care of you,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.540
and we didn't even get to thank him.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.933
He's been busy at school lately.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.610
Then great.

00:12:54.777 --> 00:12:56.440
Once his exams are over,
invite him over.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.888
I'll cook something nice for him.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.550
Dad.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.250
Jin.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.460
Stay home tonight, alright?

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.720
No one's been using this room.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.730
It gets dusty easily.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.130
Later, I'll change the sheets for you.

00:14:01.022 --> 00:14:02.933
It's okay.
I'll change them myself in a bit.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.850
If you're free,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.250
just come back more often.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.720
Whenever you're home,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.130
the whole place feels livelier.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.540
You've had a lot on your plate.

00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:21.250
You've worked pretty hard too.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.600
Luckily,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.970
a lot of things have been settled.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.540
And the tasks

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.910
you needed to finish

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.940
are all done now.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.730
And Wu...

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.360
After two years in Yi City,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.540
he's started college now.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.460
You can finally relax a little.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.370
With you and Mom around,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.250
I've always felt relaxed.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.440
You two,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.770
come have some fruit.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.610
Coming.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.850
Go eat some fruit.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.870
I'll pass, Dad.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.222
I don't eat sweets at night.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.770
Alright then.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.300
(Sister.)

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.180
(It's Li Wu)

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.730
(Sorry to bother you.)

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.820
(I'll work hard.)

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.480
(I won't let you down.)

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.420
(Don't worry.)

00:15:39.644 --> 00:15:41.460
(Everything will
get better from now on.)

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.460
(Will it?)

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.490
(It will. I promise.)

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.860
♪Is still hiding in a parallel universe♪

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:59.750

♪I can only admit it♪

♪Even if they mock

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.250
You're back.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.730
What's all this?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.340
What do you think?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.250
You're going to the US?

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.650
Why?

00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:04.555
You're still pretending you don't know?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.720
I've been waiting these past few days

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.820
for you to tell me

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.720
why you gave up

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.740
your exchange spot.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.440
Why did I have to hear it

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.500
from your teacher instead?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.210
Actually,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.580
I never planned to go from the start.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.750
Before you made that decision,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.790
you didn't think

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.850
you needed to talk to me?

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.550
Or is it that

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.130
you still don't trust me?

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:34.650
No, I...

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.260
I was just scared.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.260
Scared of what?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.890
Scared that we'd be apart.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.500
Or scared that I'd fall out of love?

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.720
With distance

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.310
comes change...

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.850
Aren't you

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.540
worried about that too?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.340
So you don't care at all?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.750
If you go to the US,
will you fall out of love?

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.820
Of course not.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240
And I won't either.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.400
What are you worried about?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.890
Won't you miss me?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.780
If you leave,
of course, I'll hate being apart.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.650
But that feeling

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.200
is nothing compared

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.060
to your future.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.960
And I'll do

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.880
everything I can

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.890
to stay by your side.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.160
I already reached out

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.540
to a friend who works in the US.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.740
His company happens to be hiring.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.590
He's already referred

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.780
my resume internally.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.310
KS is a well-known

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.920
advertising agency in the industry.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.610
It's the dream of countless advertisers.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.400
So, you're going to the US

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.210
because of me?

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.680
We can choose

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.800
our future life together.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.820
Isn't that right?

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.930
Yes.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.170
Where's your exchange school?

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.650
It's in...

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.500
Pennsylvania.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.780
In Pennsylvania...

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.060
Philadelphia.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.070
Can you still

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.066
contact the school now?

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.740
It should be.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.540
It is.

00:19:21.155 --> 00:19:22.580
My offer letter's in New York.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.310
(New York, US)

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.170
Let me check something.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.620
(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
United States)

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.030
It's only a little
over two hours by car.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.820
Not far at all.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.410
Let me look into where to rent

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.890
in New York.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.410
Check the places near your school.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.500
(Searching apartments)

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.060
What's wrong?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.130
Nothing.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.580
It's just...

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.680
You included me

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.133
in all your plans for the future.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.820
Thank you, Sister.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.140

(Find a day this week,)

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.790
(and we'll go)

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.680
(get your visa)

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.580
(and passport done.)

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.030
(We'll prepare)

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.690
(the essentials.)

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.170
(Okay, we'll go together.)

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.850
My resignation paperwork is almost done.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.960
I've also booked the visa interview.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.610
My passport should be ready in a week.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:28.890
Okay.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.500
So...

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.690
Where're we going next?

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.270
We have a lot to do today.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.160
First, we need to open

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.370
an international bank account.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.610
Then, we'll go buy things.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.690
Okay.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.450
Let's go.

00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:03.130
What're you looking at?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.800
Before we leave,

00:22:04.822 --> 00:22:06.030
I want to help my parents

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.210
find a reliable housekeeper.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.030
Once we go abroad,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.480
we'll be gone for at least half a year.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.350
I can't just

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.200
count on Chun Chang for everything.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.740
True.

00:22:14.288 --> 00:22:15.260
Let me help you check.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.610
Did you finish packing?

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:22.980
Pretty much.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.350
You're only taking

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.210
this little clothing?

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.450
I can buy new ones abroad.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.820
No need to bring the old stuff.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.130
You like getting new things?

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.610
Yeah.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.440
I do like new things.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.850
You'd better treat me well.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.690
Otherwise,

Your internship is over.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.760
You invited me

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.250

Might not make it in time.

00:36:00.488 --> 00:36:01.280
I still have plans

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.500
with Cheng Rui and Wen later.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.170
Then I need to stop by the bar.

00:36:04.422 --> 00:36:06.950
We ordered a bunch of party supplies,
and they were delivered there.

00:36:06.955 --> 00:36:07.977
I should pick them up.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.690
Alright.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.330
Take care of yourself in the US.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.500
Stay in touch.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.420
I will.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.630
Thank you, Mr. Shen,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.133
for looking out for me all this time.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.800
Your internship's over.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.022
No need to call me Mr. Shen.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.840
Call me Shen, or Yiyang.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.577
Either is fine.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.580
Not sure Cheng Rui would agree.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.690
Don't listen to him.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.460
Listen to me.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:32.540
Alright.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.420
Then, I'll get going.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.330
Safe travels.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.030
I'm off.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.540
Yiyang.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.230
Aren't you two gonna help?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.250
Seriously, you two?

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.770
Bro, can you be a little careful?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.510
How did someone with your service level

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.320
survive working

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.460
at a milk tea shop?

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.030
Paid service

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.650
isn't the same as volunteer work.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.580
What?

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:14.500
You giving me a tip?

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:15.500
Come on then.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.940
My tongue just took a bullet.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.610
Is yours good?

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.940
Let me try yours.

00:37:36.177 --> 00:37:37.250
I already drank from it.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.360
It's fine.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.420
It's not like I mind you.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.000
Ever thought maybe

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.100
he's the one minding you?

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.060
Wow, really nice of you.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.860
Like I care.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400
Who knows when

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.380
we'll next

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.860
sit here like this.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.210
But it's fine.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.800
Once I pass TOEFL,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800
I'm going to the US.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.000
Then, we can travel the world

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.420
side by side again.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.550
Your mom picked schools

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.280
for you, right?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.400
They're all near L.A.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.190
That's almost four thousand kilometers

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.760
from Li Wu.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.060
Five to six hours by plane.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.810
That far?

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:22.380
Doesn't matter.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.670
At least we'll still be standing

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.810
on the same land.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.320
Why not say the whole world's

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.770
standing on the same land then?

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.020
What's your problem?

00:38:32.466 --> 00:38:33.760
Why do you keep raining on me?

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.990
Stabbing me right in the heart?

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.100
I'm stating facts.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.400
As if.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.670
You're just tearing me down.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.510
I... When did I?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.230
Can you two stop arguing?

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.690
He means you, stop yelling.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.110
No, he clearly means you.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.810
You're the one making noise.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.510
I'm making noise?

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.070
You're yelling.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:52.290
- You've been roasting me nonstop.
- You're embarrassing me.

00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:53.980
And you're pointing at me?

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.844
- I grabbed your milk tea for you!
- You still care about face?

00:38:56.844 --> 00:38:58.710
Look at you. You're even hitting me now.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.290
I'm pointing...

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.460
I'll head out now.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.060
Okay.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.020
Li Wu, you're here.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.230
Chun Chang.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.170
Slow day?

00:39:09.511 --> 00:39:10.666
I'm picking something up.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.100
Your friend?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.550
Yeah.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.730
She came to see me off.

00:39:23.733 --> 00:39:25.355
Why didn't you stay a bit longer?

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.690
We already talked.

00:39:28.022 --> 00:39:30.110
Didn't you say you were
going to the research institute

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:30.980
to pack your stuff?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.190
Why're you here?

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.440
I ordered some party supplies.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.600
Everything got delivered here.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.250
I don't want them taking up space here.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.900
Just leave them here.
No need to take them.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.420
But I...

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.130
We can't take them with us anyway.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.460
Leave them here.

00:39:45.577 --> 00:39:47.020
Chun Chang will definitely use them.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.610
Yeah.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.110
Next month, our bar's

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.460
throwing an event.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.540
Li Wu...

00:39:52.911 --> 00:39:54.920
When you get to the US,
take good care of yourself.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.060
Stay safe, okay?

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.290
Okay.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.900
I'll take good care of her too.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.760
That's right.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.650
She comes first.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.210
Oh, right.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.380
Once you're there,

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.420
you...

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.330
Chun Chang.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.280
About my parents...

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.650
Can you drop by sometimes?

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.760
Don't worry.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.000
Your parents are my parents.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.020
Of course, I'll visit.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.170
And with how easy travel is now,

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.590
maybe in a few days

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.650
I'll pop up in the US.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.650
Alright.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.690
We'll get going then.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.440
Take care.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.840
We're off.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.070
Bye.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.800
Bye. Chun Chang.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.130
Bye.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.190
Once you get there,

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.100
if you can't get used
to living in the dorms,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.400
you can rent a place

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.060
near campus.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.800
When I finish checking in,

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.888
I'll meet you in New York.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.810
By then,
you'll probably have settled in.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.320
They suddenly told me

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.130
to start work early.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.250
It messed up my plans.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.150
But once we're there,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.577
we'll both have to settle in anyway.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.540
We won't see each other for a while.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.400
Don't worry.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.170
I already checked.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:06.590
The place you rented

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.440
is only a little over

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.911
a two-hour drive from my school.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.420
Once I'm all settled,
I'll get a US driver's license.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.044
Used cars over there are cheap.

00:41:13.044 --> 00:41:14.400
When I don't have class on weekends,

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.400
I can drive over to see you.

00:41:17.177 --> 00:41:17.810
Sounds great.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.940
And I heard there's

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.060
Times Square,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.630
the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.760
and tons and tons

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.020
of amazing art museums.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.800
When we've got the time,

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.511
we'll drive over and check them all off.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.880
Aren't there also

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.977
a bunch of great foods?
