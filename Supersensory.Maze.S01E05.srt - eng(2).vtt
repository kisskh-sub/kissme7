00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.920
Hello, we've met before.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.070
We're police officers, remember?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.970
Sorry to take up your time.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.200
You grew up with Wang Chen?

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.710
Zhuang Mingcheng!

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.790
Liu Ming!

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.470
Sorry!

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.280
The subscriber you dialed

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.840
cannot be connected for the moment.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.510
You are destroying the scene.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.720
I find it strange.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.270
Wasn't her illness already cured?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.360
Why did it relapse again?

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.160
It's not Yutong's fault.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.630
She is the one who was hurt.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.030
Actually,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.120
it was my sense of guilt

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.510
that pushed her into the abyss.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.120
If I hadn't run away at that time,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.230
would everything

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.870
have had a new ending?

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.070
The three of us

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.390
were best friends.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.120
What have I done?

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.240
I...

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.510
I didn't mean it.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.610
I didn't mean it.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.520
I didn't mean it.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.120
Your face and their faces

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120
just overlapped.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.270
Don't be afraid.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.680
The people who bullied you

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.160
have long been brought to justice.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.630
I've abandoned her once,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.560
but there won't be a second time.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.160
Can I go see her?

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.350
Forget it.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.190
She probably doesn't want to see me.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.310
Wang Chen,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.270
the group photo on your desk...

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.190
Who cut one person out?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.860
It should be three people, right?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.170
Since it was cut,
why still keep it there?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.510
We have always been friends.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.510
You don't want to be the one

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.190
who sends Zhang Yutong to prison,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.240
because you feel you owe her.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.270
You disposed of the body for her.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.510
You thought Chen might end up in prison

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.510
because of Zhang's crime,

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.160
and you felt sorry for Chen,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.030
so

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.010
you turned yourself in.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.040
Why did Zhang suddenly fall ill?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.260
It was Chen Danling, right?

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.360
Have you ever thought

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.000
that Zhang Yutong
wanted you to stop her

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.440
and save her,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.680
instead of covering up the truth?

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.720
Why did you leave me behind?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.870
She's been fine for so many years.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.630
If no one replaced her medicine,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.000
she's most likely

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.510
to continue to be fine.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.870
Do you still feel

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.040
what you did is good for them?

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.240
I shouldn't have let them meet.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.140
(Observation Room,
Information Collection Room)

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.940
(He will be more obedient than a pet,
and he will be soon.)

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.230
Hello, Ms. Chen.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.910
I have a question.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.550
When you run out of inspiration,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.000
do you take some extreme measures

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.870
to spark inspiration?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.870
Officer Xu,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.840
I don't know whether you came

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.200
for official or personal matters.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.360
If it's official business,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.370
it'll require
two police officers present.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.200
If it's a personal matter,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.600
please leave.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.550
I don't want to talk with you.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440
My colleague.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.510
You changed Zhang Yutong's medicine.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.230
What medicine?

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.000
I haven't seen Zhang Yutong

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.910
for about five or six years.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
Let me help you recall.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.550
You found an excuse

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.200
to have Wang Chen invite her out.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.600
You deliberately spilled water on her.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.630
When she was tidying up,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.460
you switched her medicine.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.960
I can arrange

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.080
videos like this

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.440
into 100 different stories.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.910
Storytelling is your profession.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.510
Ensuring the people's safety

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.440
is my occupation.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.360
We've got the medicine.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.840
The capsule shell is real.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.180
The substance inside is Buspirone.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.820
It can induce schizophrenia.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.040
On the bottle and capsule,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.120
fingerprints were detected.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.000
It was Chen Danling.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.800
Chen Danling,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.630
in the event you organized back then,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.200
Zhang Yutong was raped.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.150
Yet you slipped away.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.120
I have read all of your works.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.510
Indeed, I did not find

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.720
any similar plot.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.200
Did your conscience awaken,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.540
or did you deliberately erase

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.610
that memory?

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.720
Not every person or event

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.790
is worth being written into my book.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.630
Officer Xu,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.080
do you think

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.270
you'll appear

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.390
in my next book?

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.440
I'm not interested.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.150
More creative materials.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.270
Zhang Yutong's paintings

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.630
always remind us

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.510
of your existence.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.000
I just gave her a little push.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.280
Officer Xu,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.790
do you want results

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.270
or the truth?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.680
Sir,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.320
your behavior is very dangerous.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.910
How risky.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.640
You desperately tried to attract
the attention of the police.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.920
What's wrong with you?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.510
It's okay if you want to die.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.030
Give me the ledger first.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.510
Stop draining my patience.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.390
I'm very curious.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.270
Where did those photos you took

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.220
of the ledger come from?

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.790
Is Zheng Xintao's death

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.360
related to you?

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.420
(Abnormal Psychology)

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.550
(Thanks to Zhang Yutong.)

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.000
(She gave me the opportunity)

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.440
(to drag Xu Jingzhi)

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.080
(into this irreplaceable performance)

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.000
(without leaving any trace.)

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.470
The meal is ready.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.110
After going through such a case,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.910
I feel so warm to eat the food

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.160
you cooked at home.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.220
You solved such a case
just after your return.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.550
Do you feel excited?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.100
Are you afraid I might be too excited?

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.550
Afraid I might think of Wu Min

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.270
and fall into past obsessions?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.560
I forgot to put salt in the soup.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.350
I...

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.000
I think it's very suitable.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.790
No need to change the subject.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.840
I did not.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.360
Whether it's Wu Min or Lu Ran,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.120
they've been gone for a long time.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.870
You should have your own life.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.800
Put it in your bowl.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.840
Do you agree?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.320
Yes.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.550
In the past, I didn't care.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.720
But now, I care that you're here.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.490
This is the key point.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.970
If I keep being stuck in the past,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.300
how could I face you?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.590
You should change the password.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.030
To the safe?

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.280
Don't play dumb.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.680
I'm serious.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.600
It got into my eye.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.790
You scared me.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.050
- Which eye?
- This one.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.440
Any bone fragments?

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.280
You're pretending.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.840
None.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.680
You're done eating?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.750
You're changing the subject now.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.140
(Inpatient Department)

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.030
You're not an artist.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.300
Why mess around with this thing?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.640
My only hobby when I was a child.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.350
What a pity.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.110
I wasn't destined for it.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.350
What if I switch careers

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.310
to do art now?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.880
Your injury has healed, right?

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.110
Where's the ledger?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.180
Have you completed the tasks

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.050
I handed over to you

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.790
on time?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.100
I've been putting up with you
for a long time.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.880
I know.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440
Don't worry.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.270
I've met your boss.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.440
I will give her the ledger.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.110
She told me to make good use of you,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.030
just like she does.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.270
Do you think I'd believe you?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.040
You...

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.310
Hello, Mr. Xu.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.590
I just wanted to thank you
for saving me.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.240
Also,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.550
Mr. Xu,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.640
my whole body hurts now.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.270
It hurts everywhere.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.000
When will you

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.790
have time to visit me at the hospital?

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.870
Your body has recovered?

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.570
Looks like you're about
to be discharged.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.760
Mr. Xu.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.890
I didn't expect you to come.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.310
We've met quite a few times,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.670
so we can be considered acquainted.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.200
More than just acquainted.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.750
You saved my life.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.100
You're struggling with it?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.560
You can't open it?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.280
Myasthenia.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.350
Myasthenia?

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.870
Don't worry.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.070
Don't worry.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.190
Impossible.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.240
I have my way.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.640
Your relationship

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.590
is quite thrilling.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.310
You were almost killed.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.000
Next time I fall in love,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.200
I'll need to confirm first

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.960
whether she's killed someone.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.390
Yeah.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.440
Once confirmed,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.640
call the police first.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.310
I can just call you,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.520
right?

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.960
You won't always be so unlucky, right?

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:04.880
No, thanks.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.260
Looks like it tastes pretty good.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.550
The taste of childhood.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.920
The place where you grew up

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.000
produces peaches?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.310
I was not allowed to eat back then.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.640
I am allergic to peach fuzz.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.920
No, thank you.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.510
Are you allergic too?

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.160
I'm not allergic to peach fuzz.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.550
Schizophrenia.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:08.240
It is hard to control
emotions and behavior.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.560
I have seen it.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.970
What does it feel like?

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.200
I want to save her.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.280
Save who?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.070
Zhang Yutong.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.680
You and I are

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.310
the same kind of person.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.680
I don't love as deeply as you do.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.960
I don't have myasthenia.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.410
How did I end up eating canned food?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.080
The shoes got dripped on.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.690
You're moved to tears?

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.710
You even started trembling.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Look at this peach.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.590
This is not an allergy.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.920
You just get sick after eating peaches.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.640
Come in.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.390
Captain He,

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.020
I've finished organizing
the case report.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.860
Please take a look.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.870
Okay.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.110
Sit.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.310
Where is Mr. Xu?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.840
Do you need him?

00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.630
Not really.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:01.880
I'm just a bit confused.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.070
Why? Tell me.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.670
Go ahead.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.350
Chen Danling harmed her friend

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.590
out of jealousy.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.440
Does she not feel guilty at all?

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:18.100
After all these years,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.240
she even changed her medicine

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.840
and waited for her illness to flare up.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.720
How can someone be so bad?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.370
You just want to talk to Mr. Xu

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.210
about these things?

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.510
Is my question kind of silly?

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.000
Not really.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.820
New police officers are like this.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.640
But if you ask Xu Jingzhi,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.530
he will surely say

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.750
some motivational things

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.680
like serving justice.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.510
What would you say?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.240
The case has been closed.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.740
Go home and get a good night's sleep.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.950
Liu Ming,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.960
submit your Party Membership Application

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.030
as soon as possible.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.240
I'll be your introducer.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.720
Thanks, Captain He.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.760
Go.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.440
Let's go; I'll walk you home.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.510
I won't trouble you.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.200
Your arrival

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.590
already makes me very happy.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440
It's no trouble at all.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.960
Don't you live right upstairs from me?

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.080
No need to be polite.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.310
Since we're neighbors now,

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.270
let's visit each other more often.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.590
I thought you

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.960
didn't like socializing.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.680
It depends on the person.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.880
Alright, you're home.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.640
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.510
No need.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.200
When you can't take care of yourself,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.240
bang on the floor.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.270
I can't help you with bathing.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.880
Where is the ledger I asked for?

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.280
Ledger.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.270
Just because of the ledger,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.830
Hu Bo killed Xinxin.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.070
Stop knocking.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.340
I've told you so many times.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.720
They went abroad.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.230
If you want to find him,
call him or send him a message.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.200
Seriously.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.300
(I've received the ledger.)

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.720
(Where are you?)

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.690
(Why not give it to me directly?)

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.690
(My husband and I went abroad
for vacation.)

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.120
(I'll contact you when I'm back.)

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.590
(Why go on vacation with him?)

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.180
(What's wrong with you?)

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.830
(Are you Wu Xinxin?)

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.490
(Xinxin, don't scare me.)

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.430
(What's wrong with you?)

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.490
(Answer the phone, okay?)

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.750
Wu Xinxin died because of me.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.880
If I hadn't told her
to steal the ledger,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880
she wouldn't have died.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.390
So,

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.350
I want Hu Bo's life.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.240
I have read the ledger.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.920
Zhao Xueli, Xu Yi,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.740
and Jiang Yongquan,
whom you are looking for,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.440
as well as the boss behind him.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.000
I won't let anyone go.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.720
I want them to pay with their blood.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.240
I have prepared

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.720
Hu Bo for you.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.510
Kill him with your own hands.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.370
Only then can I believe
that you're determined

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.830
to complete our plan.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.160
These people

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.920
forced you to take your body

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.960
as a bargaining chip for benefits.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.510
I want to tell you

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.000
what will happen next.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.110
Everything you did to Xinxin

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.400
will be made public.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.200
I want you to regret it.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.640
For a scumbag like you,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.400
ten thousand deaths are not enough.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.680
The ledger

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.960
will become the knife

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.640
that you stabbed
into those people above.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.960
Xinxin is my only friend

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.030
in this world,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.270
and you killed her.
