PIN-YU

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:36.516
What's up?

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.185
Sis, it's me.

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:40.687
Listen.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.733
I think I saw that girl again today.

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:49.612
Which girl?

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.366
Hello?

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:56.035
Pin-yu?

00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:59.205
Yun-chen, is that you?

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:02.625
Hsiao-tung?

00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:41.224
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:44.852
Hey, this isn't right.

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:47.730
It's been agreed.
How can you just change it on a whim?

00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.857
I understand how you feel,

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:52.318
but I'm just relaying
the inmate's message.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.210
Why did you agree to the interview?

00:03:29.564 --> 00:03:31.607
Didn't we agree to end all of this?

00:03:33.526 --> 00:03:35.903
Can't you just quietly die alone?

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.269
What do you plan to do next?

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.988
Hsu Ta-wei, I'm asking you a question.

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:21.407
What do you plan to do next?

00:04:27.705 --> 00:04:28.873
What can we do?

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:30.333
Just wait.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.335
For how long?

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.464
What if you wait until his execution,
and he still won't do the interview?

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:37.882
What will you do about this film?

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:45.890
Gosh. It's not your first time
filming a documentary, is it?

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.561
Shitty things like someone
declining an interview aren't new.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.648
There are ways to film
without an interviewee.

00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:54.982
Why are you so worried?

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:00.822
Ta-wei.

00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:04.200
Look, you haven't received
a single subsidy for your film.

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:06.536
There's no breach of contract
if you stop filming.

00:05:07.036 --> 00:05:10.123
Take on commercial gigs first
to at least recover the losses.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:13.793
Don't forget,

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:16.879
we have to pay Yu's wages
and the rent here.

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:21.384
Don't be so willful.
You always go for the unprofitable films.

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:23.928
Are you done yet, Liu Chien-yi?

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:26.222
You keep talking about money.

00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:29.267
If you're scared of losing money,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.563
you shouldn't have fucking become
a filmmaker in the first place!

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.233
There are bound to be risks.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.656
Let's get this straight.
This company doesn't only belong to you.

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:48.161
I've sunk all my money into this place.
Can't I even say a word?

00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:52.874
Don't forget what you said
when you asked me to join the company.

00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:54.750
You told me not to give up

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:56.836
and said we'd learn
to fund gigs with gigs.

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:01.257
And what now?
I'm the one doing all the commercial work.

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.510
Only you get to film your pet projects.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:09.515
Fuck. You're more suited to being
a freeloading scammer than a director.

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:12.935
All right, why don't you two…

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.020
Shut up.

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.647
I haven't even brought up Yu yet.

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:17.857
Me?

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:22.403
Back then, you said the company
had to hire someone to be our assistant.

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:23.404
And now?

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.990
You use her
as your personal assistant daily.

00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:30.536
I'm out there making films that pay,
and I have to call and order my own lunch,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.121
do favors for others, and find venues.

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:34.790
How dare you slam the door and leave.

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:37.293
I should be the one
slamming the door and leaving.

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:38.503
My bag.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:42.465
No, I'm not slamming the door and leaving.
I was just walking over here.

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:48.054
Ta-wei, why don't you--

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:49.764
Enough! Leave her be!

00:06:55.728 --> 00:06:56.938
Leave it!

00:07:07.657 --> 00:07:09.283
-Get the equipment.
-Okay.

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:11.536
We're going to film something else!

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.560
HSIAO-TUNG

00:08:11.887 --> 00:08:13.055
Hurry up.

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.644
Is this where Li Jen-yao used to live?

00:08:18.728 --> 00:08:21.397
Yes, he lived here
before going to a correctional school.

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:24.025
So are we taking scenery shots today?

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.360
No, we're doing interviews.

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:28.112
-With whom?
-Hey.

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:29.280
Mrs. Li.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.199
Hi, it's been a while. How are you?

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:33.117
Allow me.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.871
How have you been?

00:09:04.774 --> 00:09:05.733
What are you doing?

00:09:05.816 --> 00:09:07.151
I'm coming.

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:08.944
Hurry up.

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:10.196
Okay.

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:15.159
Here.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:19.205
Are you ready?

00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:20.831
Hey, the tablet.

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:30.966
Mrs. Li.

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:33.427
Here, take a look.

00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:37.223
It's what you asked me to film.

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:19.098
Here's the last question.

00:10:20.683 --> 00:10:22.727
You've been here for so many years.

00:10:23.227 --> 00:10:25.062
Do you miss your mom?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.904
Then… do you have anything

00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:36.365
you want to say to your mom?

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:08.814
So… Mrs. Li,

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:11.525
I did what you asked.

00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:16.280
Does that mean you'll let us film?

00:11:19.492 --> 00:11:22.620
Can I watch it again?

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:24.079
Of course.

00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:49.313
So, Mrs. Li,

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.816
you mentioned earlier

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:54.860
that Jen-yao didn't have
a good relationship with his dad.

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:58.864
Can you tell us more about
what his dad was like?

00:12:06.664 --> 00:12:12.545
He… wasn't that bad in the beginning.

00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:16.882
During his better days,
he treated us very well.

00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:18.801
He would

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:22.805
drive us to the seaside

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:25.015
and take us out for delicious food.

00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:28.018
Then things didn't go well at work,

00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:30.062
so he started drinking.

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:32.648
He kept drinking more,

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:34.400
and his mood kept getting worse.

00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:39.613
I don't know
exactly when he started beating me.

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:44.243
But in the beginning,
he didn't beat Jen-yao.

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:47.621
Later on,

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.126
Jen-yao couldn't stand it
and wanted to shield me.

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:55.129
That's when his dad got angrier

00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:57.047
and started beating Jen-yao.

00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:06.557
Mrs. Li, you said in your police statement

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.394
that you and Li Jen-yao
were abused at home for over ten years.

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:14.815
Didn't you ever consider
fighting back during that time?

00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:19.820
Fight back?

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:24.867
How?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.371
I'm just a woman.

00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:31.498
How could I win?

00:13:34.418 --> 00:13:37.546
Even if I were to run away,
I wouldn't know where to go.

00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:40.966
I had no choice.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.176
So

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.304
I just let him beat me as he pleased.

00:13:45.387 --> 00:13:47.389
I stayed put and let him beat me.

00:13:47.473 --> 00:13:49.600
Then he wouldn't hurt Jen-yao.

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:51.060
Jen-yao would be fine.

00:13:51.727 --> 00:13:54.813
But Jen-yao just wouldn't listen.
He had to resist.

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:56.649
He even struck back multiple times.

00:13:57.316 --> 00:13:58.567
How could he do that?

00:13:58.651 --> 00:14:00.235
He's the son.

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:02.154
How can a son hit his dad?

00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:07.701
So I would grab Jen-yao and stop him.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:09.286
I'd just let his dad beat me.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.790
It'd all be fine
when he sobered up, right?

00:14:12.873 --> 00:14:15.000
That'd be the end of it.

00:14:15.501 --> 00:14:18.754
A son can't beat his dad,
no matter what, right?

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:42.611
Do you all think…

00:14:45.781 --> 00:14:47.449
Jen-yao is where he is today

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.827
because of me?

00:14:52.454 --> 00:14:54.289
Jen-yao used to be so well-behaved,

00:14:54.915 --> 00:14:56.583
respectful…

00:14:58.752 --> 00:15:00.504
and considerate.

00:15:03.257 --> 00:15:06.260
I don't know
why he became like this either.

00:15:09.263 --> 00:15:10.097
So, Mrs. Li,

00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:12.683
have you ever asked Li Jen-yao

00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:14.727
why he did those things?

00:15:19.982 --> 00:15:22.109
No.

00:15:25.738 --> 00:15:28.741
I haven't seen him since that day.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.994
Why won't you visit him?

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.144
Take good care of yourself from now on.

00:16:02.232 --> 00:16:03.817
I won't be coming back.

00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:24.838
Mrs. Li, are you okay?

00:16:26.423 --> 00:16:27.508
What's wrong?

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.352
I haven't taken my medicine.
I don't feel well.

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:42.773
Well…

00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:44.483
It's okay, Mrs. Li.

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:48.237
If you're not feeling well,
we can call it a day here.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.573
Why don't we find another time
to finish this up?

00:16:52.157 --> 00:16:53.659
Wasn't today good enough?

00:16:53.742 --> 00:16:54.868
I…

00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:57.412
If today was okay, then that's enough.

00:16:57.496 --> 00:16:58.914
-I don't--
-Mrs. Li.

00:16:58.997 --> 00:17:02.334
It's really all right.
Don't talk about it if you don't want to.

00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:04.503
We won't film anymore either, okay?

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:05.754
So how about this?

00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:09.675
If you want to talk to someone
about this in the future,

00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:13.011
or if you think you can continue filming,

00:17:13.095 --> 00:17:14.096
then call me, okay?

00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:16.056
Did you hear that?

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:17.808
Pack up our things.

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:20.018
I'll go for a smoke
and bring the car around.

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:44.621
What are you doing?

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.294
Mrs. Li.

00:19:51.753 --> 00:19:52.838
Mrs. Li.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:56.133
Do you know this girl next to Li Jen-yao?

00:19:56.216 --> 00:19:57.592
No, I don't.

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.219
What's with you? Let's go.

00:19:59.303 --> 00:20:00.637
Hold on.

00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:02.055
Then what about this CD?

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:03.432
Does this belong to him?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.146
I brought back this CD
when I went to tidy up his place in Taipei

00:20:09.229 --> 00:20:12.107
after Jen-yao was sent away.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:16.111
Why did you go through our things?

00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:19.448
We didn't. Let's go.

00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:20.657
Go.

00:20:21.158 --> 00:20:22.534
Pack up our things quickly.

00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:23.994
I'm sorry, Mrs. Li.

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.664
Pack up quickly.

00:20:34.212 --> 00:20:36.089
What were you doing? What got into you?

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:38.884
Miss,

00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:41.303
we're filming a documentary.

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.221
We're not detectives.

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:46.892
-I just really want to know who she is.
-So who is she to you?

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:48.894
How is this your business?
Do you know her?

00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:51.646
I don't know
if you'd consider it knowing her.

00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.279
You know that girl?

00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:08.038
Tossing cigarette butts like that is rude.

00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:09.664
Fine. You're so annoying.

00:21:22.928 --> 00:21:23.887
Okay.

00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:26.264
I'm asking you seriously this one time.

00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:28.517
Was what you just said true?

00:21:29.851 --> 00:21:33.772
Where you live now used to be occupied
by a tenant named Chang En-ya.

00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:35.816
Also, you found out

00:21:35.899 --> 00:21:40.195
that the female ghost looked up Li Jen-yao
after she'd possessed you.

00:21:40.278 --> 00:21:42.114
Is all that true? You didn't lie to me?

00:21:42.197 --> 00:21:43.573
I swear.

00:21:46.284 --> 00:21:48.120
Why would I lie to you?

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:52.249
I hadn't been able to figure out
why this female ghost came to me.

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:56.169
But I just found out she and Li Jen-yao
went to the same high school.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.213
Then it clicked.

00:21:58.296 --> 00:21:59.506
Can you get to the point?

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:04.428
According to all the information,

00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:06.388
besides Wang Yu-hsiang's wife and child,

00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:08.557
all the victims
were Li Jen-yao's classmates.

00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:11.226
So now you suspect

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:14.771
that this female ghost
was someone killed by Li Jen-yao too?

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:21.486
I don't know.

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:28.577
Let me tell you.

00:22:29.953 --> 00:22:31.621
Go back to Taipei on your own first.

00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:35.876
Tell Chien for me
that I'm staying here for a few more days.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:37.377
Why?

00:22:38.128 --> 00:22:41.673
I'm staying to help you investigate
who the ghost haunting you really is.

00:22:43.216 --> 00:22:46.595
And you're going
to the detention center again.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.931
Ask Li Jen-yao directly if he knows her.

00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:05.739
TO CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.420
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, AGENCY OF CORRECTIONS

00:23:20.504 --> 00:23:23.673
But didn't he ask us not to interview him?

00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:25.425
Use your brain.

00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:27.802
He only said
we couldn't interview him, right?

00:23:27.886 --> 00:23:30.388
But did he say
we couldn't meet with him alone?

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:43.610
I didn't think
you'd still agree to see me.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.035
Why did you suddenly back out of filming?

00:23:57.165 --> 00:23:58.166
No reason.

00:23:59.626 --> 00:24:00.669
I just don't want to.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:06.466
Don't come again.

00:24:07.217 --> 00:24:08.593
I won't see you again.

00:24:15.475 --> 00:24:17.435
If you didn't want this to continue,

00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:20.522
you could've canceled this meeting.

00:24:22.524 --> 00:24:24.234
Why did you agree to see me anyway?

00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:31.241
Because

00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:35.120
I wanted to say goodbye to you in person.

00:24:38.373 --> 00:24:40.375
After all, there aren't many people left

00:24:40.458 --> 00:24:41.793
that I can say goodbye to.

00:24:48.341 --> 00:24:49.426
Chou Pin-yu.

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:54.222
Bye.

00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:05.108
This is good enough.

00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:06.860
I want to go back now.

00:25:07.652 --> 00:25:09.487
Wait, I have one more question.

00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:17.120
A few days ago, I visited your mom.

00:25:19.414 --> 00:25:21.916
I found this photo sticker in your room.

00:25:27.255 --> 00:25:29.090
What was your relationship with her?

00:25:38.725 --> 00:25:40.518
My intuition tells me

00:25:41.478 --> 00:25:43.772
that you probably did what you did

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.066
because of this girl.

00:25:52.364 --> 00:25:53.823
You have a wild imagination.

00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:57.285
She and I weren't close at all.

00:26:02.582 --> 00:26:04.292
I don't remember her name either.

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:10.340
Did you kill her too?

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:12.986
What was your relationship with her?

00:27:14.446 --> 00:27:16.322
Did you kill her too?

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:11.377
What happened in 2007?

00:28:12.754 --> 00:28:13.922
According to sources,

00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:15.381
in 2007,

00:28:15.465 --> 00:28:18.092
you stabbed Ouyang Ti with a knife.

00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:20.303
Can you tell us

00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:22.806
what the conflict between you two was?

00:28:28.144 --> 00:28:30.021
Did you kill her too?

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:37.445
What did he want to say at the time?

00:28:38.196 --> 00:28:41.324
Maybe he didn't kill
that high school girl.

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:45.495
Wait, then why did he hide
his relationship with that girl?

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:51.459
If that high school girl
didn't actually die,

00:28:52.877 --> 00:28:54.587
why did she haunt me?

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.632
This is frustrating!

00:28:57.715 --> 00:29:00.093
What really happened?

00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:10.395
Chiang Hsiao-tung, focus.

00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:13.022
-One, two, three, four.
-Extend.

00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:15.400
Two, two, three, four.

00:29:15.483 --> 00:29:17.861
-Three, two, three, four.
-Point your toes.

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:20.196
Four, two, three, four.

00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:03.234
Why did you bring me here?

00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:07.405
I didn't bring you here.
You came on your own.

00:32:14.412 --> 00:32:15.580
Didn't you?

00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:26.215
I want to know who you are.

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:29.552
What's your relationship with Li Jen-yao?

00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:34.474
Do you really want to know?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.534
Li Jen-yao!

00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:04.545
Didn't you see me wave to you just now?

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:15.348
You clearly saw me.

00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:17.058
Why did you ignore me?

00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:24.357
Hsiao-tung.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.984
Yun-chen?

00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:28.861
What is it?

00:33:32.865 --> 00:33:34.992
Yun-chen, where are you dragging me?

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:37.620
How did you and Li Jen-yao meet?

00:33:41.707 --> 00:33:46.254
Well… we were going to have lunch
on the rooftop one day, remember?

00:33:46.337 --> 00:33:48.089
But the student union held you up.

00:33:48.172 --> 00:33:50.383
He happened to be there that day.

00:33:50.466 --> 00:33:52.301
We chatted a little
and got to know each other.

00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.512
What is it?

00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:56.514
Why are you suddenly so serious?

00:33:56.597 --> 00:33:57.932
I'm being serious right now.

00:33:58.015 --> 00:33:59.475
You'd better stay away from him.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.394
Li Jen-yao isn't as simple as you think.

00:34:01.477 --> 00:34:03.271
What do you mean?

00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:06.566
You know Ouyang Ti?
The one you keep turning down.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.235
I know him. What about it?

00:34:10.528 --> 00:34:11.696
In our freshman year,

00:34:11.779 --> 00:34:13.739
Ouyang Ti and a few boys

00:34:13.823 --> 00:34:15.783
had a beef with Li Jen-yao
for some reason.

00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:17.451
They had a brawl in the restroom.

00:34:17.535 --> 00:34:19.287
You know how ruthless Li Jen-yao was?

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.581
Chuang Jung-tai ended up in the hospital.

00:34:21.664 --> 00:34:22.915
He even got a few stitches.

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:25.001
Is that true?

00:34:25.084 --> 00:34:26.377
Of course it's true.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.462
It caused a big stir.

00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:31.215
Li Jen-yao got one major
and one minor demerit afterwards.

00:34:31.299 --> 00:34:32.592
He nearly got expelled.

00:34:34.552 --> 00:34:35.386
But

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:39.223
we weren't the ones involved in the fight.

00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:41.934
Who's to say who was right or wrong?

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:43.978
Maybe Li Jen-yao wasn't the problem.

00:34:44.729 --> 00:34:46.397
Anyway, don't talk to him anymore.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.066
Pretend you don't know him.
Save yourself from trouble.

00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:54.197
Isn't daily dance practice tiring enough?
Why waste your time on someone like him?

00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:56.824
Yun-chen,

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.118
we've known each other forever.

00:34:59.202 --> 00:35:01.579
I've never heard you say
anything bad about anyone.

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:03.915
Do you hate Li Jen-yao so much

00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:05.750
because he did something to you?

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:08.920
Or is it just because of these rumors?

00:35:15.718 --> 00:35:18.054
Time for class.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

00:35:18.137 --> 00:35:20.097
I'm heading back. You should hurry too.

00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:21.599
Hey, Lai Yun-chen!

00:35:27.855 --> 00:35:29.607
OCEAN DRAGON SEAFOOD

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.443
Here are your stir-fried clams.

00:35:36.822 --> 00:35:38.407
Welcome. Sit wherever you want.

00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:43.996
I'm feeling pretty depressed now

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.166
because your mom and I had an agreement.

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:50.002
-Boss.
-She was supposed to bring me money today.

00:35:51.963 --> 00:35:53.047
But then?

00:35:56.092 --> 00:35:57.635
It's already been four hours.

00:35:57.718 --> 00:36:00.471
She hasn't shown up,
and she's not answering her phone.

00:36:01.597 --> 00:36:02.431
What now?

00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:04.976
Did she copy your dad's bad habits?

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:06.894
Standing hooligans up on purpose?

00:36:06.978 --> 00:36:10.564
Or does she think
they are all good people?

00:36:11.774 --> 00:36:13.276
It's no use coming to me.

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:15.361
I have no money. Please leave.

00:36:17.488 --> 00:36:19.824
Don't be so scared of me.

00:36:19.907 --> 00:36:22.118
Every time you see me,
you try to make me leave.

00:36:22.618 --> 00:36:24.453
Actually, we really pity you.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:26.831
You're so unlucky
to have parents like that.

00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:30.668
So I came today to help you.

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:33.546
I want to give you a chance.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:37.049
A chance for you
to quickly pay off your debt

00:36:37.133 --> 00:36:40.052
and cut ties with your brute of a dad.

00:36:42.221 --> 00:36:44.056
From now on, when you're at school,

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.599
sell amulets for me

00:36:45.683 --> 00:36:47.435
to keep your classmates safe.

00:36:48.394 --> 00:36:52.148
You decide if this is sold as cigarettes
for $50 each

00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:54.025
or in packs for $1,000.

00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:56.610
If you want to do this,

00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:58.487
I'll help all the way

00:36:58.571 --> 00:37:00.781
and cover the upfront costs for you.

00:37:03.534 --> 00:37:05.411
I won't sell drugs at school for you.

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:14.086
Hey. Don't go too far

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.546
or I'll call the police.

00:37:15.629 --> 00:37:17.048
Sir, come.

00:37:17.131 --> 00:37:19.342
Here's a little something for you.
Go smoke in the back.

00:37:19.842 --> 00:37:20.676
Go.

00:37:24.096 --> 00:37:27.600
I could be your enemy and hurt you

00:37:27.683 --> 00:37:30.019
or be your savior and help you.

00:37:30.102 --> 00:37:31.562
Your choice.

00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:32.730
Okay?

00:37:32.813 --> 00:37:33.647
Here.

00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:40.363
To keep you safe.

00:37:40.905 --> 00:37:41.739
Here you go.

00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:46.160
Let me know.

00:37:50.206 --> 00:37:51.290
Wang, come.

00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:57.713
Get out of the way.

00:38:09.683 --> 00:38:11.685
MAY YOU BE SAFE

00:38:21.946 --> 00:38:25.366
Jen-yao, here's the thing.
You've worked hard these past few months.

00:38:26.242 --> 00:38:29.161
-But today, the customers--
-Boss, don't worry.

00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:34.375
I won't make this hard for you.

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:38.129
Today is my last day.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.007
Thank you for looking out for me
these past few months.

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:52.518
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:39:04.488 --> 00:39:06.991
Jen-yao, how come you're back?
Don't you have work?

00:39:08.492 --> 00:39:09.368
Where are you going?

00:39:11.954 --> 00:39:15.666
A friend in Taipei got a last-minute puja
and wants my help for a few days.

00:39:15.749 --> 00:39:17.168
Here.

00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:19.587
Money.

00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:23.716
Here.

00:39:24.717 --> 00:39:25.718
Take the money.

00:39:26.677 --> 00:39:27.678
Remember to eat.

00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:28.888
Don't stay up late.

00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.639
Spend the money wisely.

00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:35.352
Are you going alone?

00:39:37.688 --> 00:39:38.564
Of course.

00:39:39.148 --> 00:39:41.901
I don't know
where your dad has run off to.

00:39:41.984 --> 00:39:43.861
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

00:39:47.323 --> 00:39:50.075
I have to go now or I'll miss my bus.

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.535
Take good care of yourself.

00:39:52.203 --> 00:39:53.245
Remember that.

00:41:13.158 --> 00:41:14.159
Hello?

00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:17.079
Is that Jen-yao?

00:41:18.122 --> 00:41:19.290
What's wrong?

00:41:20.958 --> 00:41:22.710
You're lying to me, aren't you?

00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:25.379
What are you saying?

00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:28.799
Why would I lie to you?

00:41:31.343 --> 00:41:32.511
You're lying to me.

00:41:33.012 --> 00:41:34.763
You're not going to a friend's.

00:41:37.308 --> 00:41:38.892
You won't be coming back.

00:41:38.976 --> 00:41:40.311
You want to abandon me.

00:41:48.736 --> 00:41:51.280
How could I possibly abandon you?

00:41:51.363 --> 00:41:52.531
Don't be paranoid.

00:41:52.615 --> 00:41:55.492
I'm really going to Taipei
to help a friend.

00:41:55.576 --> 00:41:56.994
I'll be back soon.

00:41:57.077 --> 00:41:59.496
Don't be paranoid. Be good.

00:42:01.248 --> 00:42:02.416
Where are you?

00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.460
Come back first, okay?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.128
Who are you talking to?

00:42:06.712 --> 00:42:07.671
Jen-yao?

00:42:08.964 --> 00:42:11.050
Don't tell him too much.

00:42:11.133 --> 00:42:14.386
Who knows if he'd give away our location?

00:42:15.012 --> 00:42:16.889
Have you thought about me?

00:42:17.473 --> 00:42:19.016
What they would do to me?

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:21.644
How could you be so selfish?

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.606
Jen-yao, you…

00:42:26.732 --> 00:42:28.817
Don't be like this.

00:42:29.693 --> 00:42:32.029
It'll be fine. Listen to me.

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:33.781
If they come to you,

00:42:33.864 --> 00:42:36.825
just tell them that we're not home.

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:38.702
Don't open the door either.

00:42:39.203 --> 00:42:41.330
They won't do anything to you.

00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:45.250
Mom.

00:42:47.086 --> 00:42:48.504
I'm begging you, okay?

00:42:48.587 --> 00:42:49.963
Can you come back?

00:42:54.843 --> 00:42:56.887
Just leave him, will you?

00:42:58.681 --> 00:42:59.598
Come back.

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:01.392
I'll take you away.

00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:03.435
You can go wherever you want.

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:05.396
I'll make money and support you.

00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:08.315
Leave him, all right?

00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:10.693
Please.

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:13.570
Listen to me this once, will you?

00:43:15.614 --> 00:43:17.533
Listen to me just this once, okay?

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.899
What do you want to tell him?

00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:55.612
I don't think this is right.

00:43:55.696 --> 00:43:56.530
Let's go back.

00:43:57.614 --> 00:43:59.366
Are you out of your mind?

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:02.327
Don't forget that your name is
on the promissory note too.

00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:05.831
If we go back now,
we're putting our lives in Big K's hands.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.833
It's better to run away now

00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:10.461
than to have your son
arrange a funeral for us, okay?

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:20.888
If… we're not there,

00:44:21.597 --> 00:44:23.932
they wouldn't do anything
to Jen-yao, would they?

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:26.685
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to Jen-yao.

00:44:36.487 --> 00:44:38.489
FROM TAICHUNG TO TAIPEI

00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:37.921
