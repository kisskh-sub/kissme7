[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.830
[Episode 6]

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.400
Sanlai,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.729
why are we doing this so late at night?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.509
It's all because that guy Brandy

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.640
gave me homework,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.720
making me circle left ten times

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.850
and right ten times.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.340
I'm not a donkey.
Why does he keep making me go in circles?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.250
Homework?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.400
What else did he give you?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.500
Can I hear about it?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.070
Turn toward the center,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.620
step on the clutch,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.480
rev the engine hard,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.100
release the clutch quickly
to start the drift,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.380
let the tail swing 90 degrees,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.810
ease off, counter-steer,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.970
immediately hit the gas
to keep it sliding,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.370
and then adjust the steering and throttle.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.680
Did you understand that?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.570
You didn't?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.100
Of course I got it right away.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.490
Let's go then.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.690
Clutch out.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.510
No, wait.
Pull the handbrake and then what?

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.940
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.970
The first step is always the hardest.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.180
We've got the first circle down.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.850
The rest will be easier.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.500
Yes.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.680
Sanlai, you're already doing great.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.810
But… this doesn't look much like a circle.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.810
Doesn't matter.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.300
As long as I got it to spin.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.580
If you want to drift in big circles,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.300
you need to
adjust the steering and throttle

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.090
to increase rear-wheel traction

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.340
and push the vehicle outward.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.200
You need speed to start drifting.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.670
Clutch in, floor the gas,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.170
then pop the clutch.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.350
This is fun!

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.540
Dad, you're so cool! Do it again!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.740
Roller coaster!

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.670
See? My daughter takes after me.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.970
Hurry up, Dad! One more time!

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.690
Alright! Roller coaster!

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.020
Faster, Dad!

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.400
If you want to drift in big circles,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.340
you need to
adjust the steering and throttle

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.650
to increase rear-wheel traction

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.310
and push the vehicle outward.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.640
You seem to have forgotten
to straighten the wheel.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.500
Why did you say exactly the same thing
as Brandy did?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.690
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.180
Sanlai, try again.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.970
Remember to straighten the wheel
once you start drifting.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.370
And don't forget the gas.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.390
Okay.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.420
I'm going all out.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.290
Sanlai, you forgot to hit the gas.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.330
I want to give it a try.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.400
Well, be careful.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.690
I haven't gotten married and had kids yet.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.480
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.940
I'll get the car out first.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.790
Well...

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.810
Just a small mistake.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.970
Have you ever driven before?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.620
I haven't,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.380
but I watched my dad drive a lot
when I was a kid.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.110
Wait. Let me think for a second.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.930
Wait a minute.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.410
Your dad?

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.100
Jin Qiang? That alcoholic?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.810
Yes.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.980
When he was young,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.450
he was a great racer.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.010
Are we talking about the same person?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.880
Feel the grip in the rear wheels.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.250
Feel how the gas and brakes work together.

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:57.590
What...

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.060
just happened?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.420
I told you. Strong genes.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.330
Family genes.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.500
Alright.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.630
Figure eight.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.580
Let's go.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.950
Brake, brake, brake!

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.540
Who drives a car

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.540
in reverse anyway?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.780
Just another small mistake.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.600
Let me try again.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.310
Wait!

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.950
I'll get out first.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.260
Are you serious?

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.620
Sanlai!

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.690
Be careful.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.630
Ease off the gas, then push.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.960
Turn the wheel earlier.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.680
Don't wait until the front goes past
before turning the wheel.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.650
You're amazing!

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.500
Was that impressive?

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.370
Yeah.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.120
Let me show you another trick.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.880
Be careful!

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.990
Are you okay?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.010
Nana?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.450
Mu!

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.300
Little fortune teller?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.500
You know Jiang Mu too?

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.100
We met on the plane.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.490
You two know each other?

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.010
She was my childhood sweetheart.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.720
Nonsense!

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.870
We were just neighbors for a few years.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.050
Mu,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.860
I signed you up
for a driving school in Manshi.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.320
We can go for lessons soon.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.810
That place is great in every way,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.980
except there are no hot guys.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.570
But tonight,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.250
I can take you somewhere with hot guys.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.860
Let's go!

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.100
Get in.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.710
Little fortune teller,
where are you taking Jiang Mu?

00:07:58.659 --> 00:07:59.250
Mu,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.620
it's very diverse here.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.480
People speak Thai, Chinese, and English.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.940
And there's one special thing—

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.060
because of the modified cars,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.280
left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles
can race together.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.500
Everyone's used to it.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.230
Nobody finds it strange at all.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.910
Let me show you around!

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.330
Welcome to

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.350
the ultimate vacation destination!

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.690
The car modification scene here

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.870
is absolutely thriving.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.190
As long as a car meets basic standards,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.500
it can be legally on the road.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.420
I categorize them into three groups:

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.100
performance,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.620
show, and supercars.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.490
I know supercars.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.659
What are the other two?

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.659
Performance cars

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.330
aren't about looks.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.780
They may look ordinary,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.299
but they have huge modification potential

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.020
and handle really well.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.179
People who drive these cars

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:45.610
are all thrill-seekers.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.060
On the track,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.490
they go all out, risking their lives.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.610
There are often straight-line drag races.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.140
My cousin is into this type.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.060
The show cars are over here.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.330
They look extremely gorgeous,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.100
with custom paint and fancy rims,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.160
but they're all show and no go—

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.850
just good for taking pictures,
not much else.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.970
I personally prefer

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.400
the supercars.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.060
Look at this sleek line.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.970
They've got the looks,

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.260
they've got the performance,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.190
and they're the complete package.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.950
Here comes a muscle car.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.490
Check out this exhaust
and listen to that roar.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.490
It makes you want to step on the gas—

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.750
like riding on clouds.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.250
But I'm not really into this car.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.900
I think it's a bit too bulky.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.360
I still prefer supercars.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.100
Sanlai!

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.260
Where's Jiang Mu?

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.650
You know Nana, right?

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.330
The little fortune teller
who read fortunes for Wan Qing?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:01.900
Yes.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.730
Jiang Mu said

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.140
they met on the plane.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.590
And tonight,
Nana took her out to have fun.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.030
[Jin Zhao]

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.180
What's wrong?

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.070
She's not answering her phone.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.330
A hot guy.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.490
Don't you think he's sexy?

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.450
Isn't your guy that type?

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.660
My guy?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.250
The one called...

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.690
Jin Zhao.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.450
He's not that type.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.890
He's quite arrogant.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.970
Mr. Attitude, huh?

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.380
Tell me the details.
I want to hear everything.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.380
Actually...

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.610
he usually seems pretty normal.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.940
But today

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.470
he suddenly did something very strange.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.260
He gave me a...

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.570
A what?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.500
Why are you being so hesitant?

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.650
That wasn't meant for you, right?

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.900
I think so. It was probably a mistake.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.540
Could it be…

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.480
he has another woman?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.500
I've thought about that too.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.440
I wanted to ask him,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800
but I was afraid it would be awkward.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.490
Sometimes

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.370
I wish he would think a little more

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.300
and not just see me as a sister.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.690
But I'm also afraid he'll overthink it.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.180
If he rejects me,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.760
I won't even get to be his sister anymore.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.380
It's so complicated.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.780
You can't just ask him directly.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.610
Right.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.300
But you can test him indirectly.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.140
How?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.300
Make him think

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.020
you have another man.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.570
Isn't that a little inappropriate?

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.210
What's inappropriate about it?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:09.970
Listen to me.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.240
This is the only way

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.420
you can find out

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.140
whether he even has

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.780
the slightest bit of feeling for you.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.850
It sounds...

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.330
like a good idea.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.090
Exactly.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.890
Where am I supposed to find a guy?

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.660
Use what's available.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.600
There are so many hot guys here.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.620
[Where have you been?]

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:32.810
Is it him?

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.310
[Why didn't you pick up?]

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.460
Don't call him back.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.740
Keep him waiting.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.450
There's an old saying in China:

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.230
"You can't make a deal
by lowering yourself."

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.390
You can't always be the proactive one.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.060
You need to provoke him a little

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.940
and take back

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.610
the initiative.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.570
Don't be afraid of using old tricks.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.210
Old tricks work best.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:01.490
Really.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.260
Now we just need a guy

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.730
competitive enough

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.810
to do us this tiny favor.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.420
Competitive?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.520
Not Liang Yanfeng.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.900
He's a well-known playboy

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.450
in this circle.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.840
Stay away from him.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.090
But from what I've seen,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.750
he's the only one
who looks competitive enough.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.470
There's someone better than him.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.580
Here he comes.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.120
My cousin, the host tonight,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.810
and the birthday boy.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.540
-Cousin?
-It's him.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.230
Let's go.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.800
I'll take you to see him.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.380
Here comes the birthday boy.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.310
Happy birthday.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.510
You're more excited than I am.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.110
Well, you're my good friend.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.670
When have I ever missed your birthday?

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.910
Looks to me like you're here for girls.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.110
Men are like race cars.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.860
If you're picking one,
pick the one that stands out in every way.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.120
Your cousin looks like a foreigner.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.250
Is he mixed-race?

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.570
No, pure local.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.020
But you're in luck.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.980
He speaks Chinese fluently.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.010
And...

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.780
he likes Chinese girls.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.830
But he looks like a bad guy.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.520
No, no, no.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.690
He's never had any

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.260
questionable women around him.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.640
The flirty types in this circle

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.130
never catch his eye.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.420
My girlfriends and I always gossip,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.300
saying he's either...

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.940
Or secretly in love

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.450
with a mysterious, sexy Chinese woman.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.060
Why a Chinese woman?

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.730
How else would he speak Chinese so well?

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.300
The biggest motivation to learn a language

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.850
is romance.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.420
Alright. Go over there and have fun.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.180
Later, when I give you a push,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.590
stand on your tiptoes.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:58.540
I'm scared.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.140
It's fine. Just listen to me.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.420
Trust me, okay?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.450
Wait a second.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.580
Sui!

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.310
Go!

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.050
Sui!

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.490
Your hairstyle
looks especially cool today.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.970
I just took a photo as a reference

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.370
to show my brother later.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420
Tonight,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.390
don't touch my car.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.900
Don't worry. Tonight...

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.370
I have another plan.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.730
Let's check the results.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.130
Look at my cousin's gaze.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.730
A woman can fall in love with him

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.490
just by looking at him.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.970
It's electrifying,
naturally full of sexual tension.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.070
Your curves aren't bad either.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.220
It's a young woman's greatest allure.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:53.870
It's okay, I guess.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.570
This photo looks pretty ordinary.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.780
How can you tell?

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.660
I'm sending you this photo now.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.970
Send it to Jin Zhao.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.280
Right away. Immediately.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.850
Hurry!

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.970
What should I say?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:07.930
Don't say anything.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.410
Just send it to him,

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.420
then send our location,

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:12.520
then...

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.210
turn off your phone.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.290
Isn't that a bit manipulative?

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.490
You might as well go full manipulative.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.140
Ten seconds after sending it,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.220
recall it.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.380
Then write,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.520
"Sent by mistake. My hand slipped."

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.450
"Don't mind me."

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.710
You're a quick learner!

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.650
Now, all we need to do is...

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.130
wait.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.480
I've sorted it out for you.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.140
That thing you wanted—

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.480
Zhang Guangyu has it.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.090
The gathering is at 9 PM tonight.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.120
Are you on your way?

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.450
I'm not coming tonight.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.610
Yeah, something came up.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.070
Okay, I'll hang up now.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.290
I'm sorry.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.660
My hand slipped. Sent by mistake.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.530
Don't mind me.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.550
Send me Nana's number.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.460
Miss Nana...

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:35.250
Oh no.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.990
That woman's henchmen
are here to catch me again.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.900
Don't look!

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.960
Face this way.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:40.970
Let's do this.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.300
Mu, wait for me a minute.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.330
Let's meet in the living room later.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.730
I'll draw him away first.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.290
See you in 10 minutes.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:13.670
Hello.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.420
Hello.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.850
So you're really Brandy's woman?

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.050
Guess not.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.970
That night at the warehouse,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.210
Brandy lied.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.530
If the people in the alliance find out,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.860
he'll be in big trouble.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.940
How much do you know about Brandy?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.840
What are you trying to say?

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.780
Clearly you're interested in this topic.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.650
If I tell you

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.260
I know a lot of his secrets,

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.380
would you be interested in talking to me?

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.590
Hello.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.210
What?

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.630
Afraid to drink it?

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.630
Are you afraid I put something in it?

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.380
You were quite bold

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.050
at the warehouse that night.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.640
I've drunk it. You can tell me now.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.160
How interesting.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.610
How could Snakey allow someone like you

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.860
to stay around Brandy?

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.970
Who's Snakey?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.820
What?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.430
You haven't met her yet?

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:41.970
Hello.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.110
I'm Jin Zhao.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.890
Jin Zhao.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:47.580
Jin Zhao?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.190
Give the phone to Jiang Mu.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.860
Miss Nana!

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.820
-Wait.
-Miss Nana.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.530
Let go of me!

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.420
-I finally…
-Help!

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.180
Miss Nana, please listen to me.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:57.970
Let go of me!

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.340
Qing is looking for you.
She's been calling you.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.860
I'm not going! I said I'm not going!

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.390
-Come with me, Miss Nana.
-What are you doing?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:04.690
Well...

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.930
Brandy, why are you here?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.190
None of your business.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.010
Come on, I'm just...

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.860
Get lost.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.140
Remember to answer your phone.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.820
Let's go.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380
Where's Jiang Mu?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.580
You're Jin Zhao, right?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.180
I asked you where Jiang Mu is.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400
Come with me.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.290
Who is this?

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.410
Nana's friend.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.770
She might have drunk something
that was drugged.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.180
I'll notify Miss Nana right away.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.290
Should I call an ambulance?

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:37.770
No need.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.050
Get me a glass of milk first.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.180
To induce vomiting?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.330
She only took one sip.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.160
It shouldn't be serious.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.020
Okay, I'll prepare it right away.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.660
Move!

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.100
Mu.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.810
Mu, what happened to you? Mu?

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.490
Were you drugged?

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.740
Was it a sedative or something else, Mu?

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.260
Mu? Mu?

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.620
Bastard.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.290
What did you say?

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.150
I said you're a bastard.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.050
Stop fighting!

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.340
Stop it! Stop fighting!

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.420
I couldn't stand you
that day at the boxing gym.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.660
You have the nerve to say that?

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.970
You ran away in the middle of the fight.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.790
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.390
Come on, let's settle it now.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.890
I hate cream the most.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.800
Sorry.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.790
I'll try something else next time.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.320
Sui, stop fighting.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.650
Nana...

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.830
Mu, you're awake?

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.730
Stop fighting, you two!

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.490
Come over! Mu's awake!

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.520
Mu!

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.470
Are you okay?

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.050
You got hurt?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.770
He thought my cousin spiked your drink,

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:20.770
so he hit him.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.940
Actually,
the two of them started fighting.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.790
It was quite a show.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.580
I just remember

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.250
having a cocktail,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.140
then I felt dizzy

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.780
and nauseous.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.210
My skin still itches.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.930
You're having an allergic reaction.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.660
Did you eat a peach?

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:13.900
I think so.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.420
That cocktail

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.450
tasted like peach.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.590
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.520
I'll return the favor another day.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.430
How's it now? Still itchy?

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.620
Really?

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:42.960
He's coming.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.100
Is he always this quiet?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.290
Maybe he's angry because he thinks

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.690
I caused trouble for him.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.000
Here you go.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.970
This is how you should be.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.010
You can't be too well-behaved.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.660
You need to cause him some trouble

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.970
every now and then.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.340
That way,

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.730
you stay on his radar.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.550
Is that necessary?

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.050
Of course.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.140
He knows you're allergic to peaches?

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.260
Haven't you two been apart for 10 years?

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.370
Yes.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.480
And he still remembers your peach allergy?

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.450
That means

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.200
he's been thinking of you all this time.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.030
Looks like tonight's little test
wasn't wasted.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.580
How is she?

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.970
Nothing serious.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.460
I've prescribed some allergy medication.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.860
Just take it as directed.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.560
He says there's nothing too serious.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.530
He's prescribed some allergy medication.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.690
Just take it at home and you'll be fine.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.450
But she needs to stay
in the hospital tonight for observation.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.560
But tonight,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.770
you need to stay in the hospital
for observation.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:16.490
By the way,

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.250
the patient shows some signs
of malnutrition.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:23.870
What did he say?

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.450
He said you're a bit...

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.530
malnourished.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.030
What kind of brother are you to her?

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.090
She's only been at your place a few days

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.410
and already malnourished.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.070
Have you been neglecting her?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.410
It's not because of him.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.010
It's just that a lot has happened

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.690
these past few days.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.090
I'm exhausted.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.450
Then you must rest properly

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.450
in the hospital today.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.940
Family member, come here.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.840
Take this to the front desk to check in.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.990
Play it by ear later.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.990
Have some fruit and get some rest.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.210
Thank you, Nana.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:06.990
By the way,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.970
I need to go back and tutor my brother.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.500
You know,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.420
he just started high school,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.250
and his grades are at the bottom.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.180
He really can't manage without me. Bye.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.710
I'm leaving Mu in your care.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.540
I won't scold you.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.970
First, act pitiful,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.050
play weak,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.920
and apologize proactively.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.330
I'm sorry about tonight.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.820
I made you worry.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.720
It's nothing.
Let's not talk about that now.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.340
Here, have some water first.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.060
Why hasn't he asked me
about the photo yet?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.210
Well...

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.280
It was that guy named Lin Sui
who saved me, right?

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.320
You know each other?

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.080
Yes, we do.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.580
He's Nana's cousin.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.410
He's quite handsome, isn't he?

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.090
Don't you have any questions for me?

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.900
Questions about what?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.940
Anything

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:39.890
you want to ask.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.050
Forget it.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.870
Ask or don't ask, whatever.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:54.810
Are you hungry?

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.600
What do you want to eat?

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.690
What kind of question is that?

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.840
It's so late.
Who would have an appetite now?

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.310
I'll call Sanlai

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.950
to get some food for you.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.390
Actually, I'm quite healthy.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.710
I eat and sleep well. I'm very healthy.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.380
I've just been a bit busy
these past few days.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.100
I know.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.490
It's my fault.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.860
It's not your fault.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.060
That's not what I meant.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.050
Get some rest early tonight.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.500
This is my first time being hospitalized.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.620
I'm a bit scared.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:49.830
I'll stay with you.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.650
You'll stay here all night?

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.010
Sanlai said...

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.730
you went out of town to meet someone.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.870
Did you go alone?

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.360
Yes, alone.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.690
Don't be afraid to ask.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.620
You need to make him face the storm.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.600
The more you avoid it, the harder it is
to see his true attitude.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.000
Did you go to meet a woman?

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.410
Why do you ask that?

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.430
Did someone give you trouble?

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.990
No one gave me trouble.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.500
I just don't want to bother you.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.430
Bother me how?

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:48.660
Like tonight.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.620
You have to stay here to take care of me.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.150
What if someone gets upset?

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.190
I went to meet a man.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.620
There was no woman.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.700
And no one will be upset.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:21.930
Unless...

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.550
you're upset.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.000
Not at all. I'm very happy.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.330
I suddenly have an appetite.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.810
I want an apple.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.110
Brandy.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.120
What are you two doing?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.000
What are you two doing?

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.090
Stop yelling in the middle of the night.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.430
What are you waiting for?
Put them over there.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.050
You called me over here
to run errands at this hour,

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.730
and you didn't even say thank you.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.290
If it weren't for Jiang Mu's health,

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.820
I wouldn't bother with you.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.900
So? Are you alright?

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.100
How's your recovery going?

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.730
I didn't even know
you were allergic to peaches.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.190
Stop babbling and get out.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.710
Don't disturb her rest.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.720
Me?

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.380
Disturb?

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.830
Come out.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.030
I need to talk to you about something.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.840
Come out.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.160
What is it?

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.210
Look at me with those eyes again,

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.070
and I'll gouge your eyeballs out.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.290
What were you doing just now?

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.100
When?

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.020
I was getting the apple.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.050
The apple?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.500
The apple smells nice.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:05.940
Jiang Mu

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.490
asked me today

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.889
if you have a girlfriend.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.580
What did you say?

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:12.670
I told her you do.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.820
But it's not official yet.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.420
Come on. You could've just told the truth
and said I don't.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.679
Why did you say something so misleading?

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.860
I thought it through very carefully.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.230
I felt that was the only answer

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.949
my conscience could live with.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.980
Keep causing trouble for me.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.340
You eat it.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.510
You don't need the apple anymore?

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.290
Nana,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.860
let me tell you, he...

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.350
Where's Sanlai?

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.050
I chased him away.

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.230
Do you still want the apple?

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.990
What were you two talking about out there?

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.090
Nothing.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.260
I...

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.150
I don't have a girlfriend,

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.640
and I'm not thinking about that right now.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.500
You don't need to worry about anything.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.220
Since you're here,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.950
besides Jin Qiang's place,

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:02.750
mine is also your home.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.730
With me around,

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.570
no one can bully you.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.790
Excuse me. I'm doing my rounds.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.370
Sign here please.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.940
Sorry about that.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.010
Isn't this the gift I gave him

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.340
when I first got here?

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.920
He actually carries it with him?

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.910
Alright, get some good rest.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.450
I'm not leaving tonight.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.010
I'll be on the bench outside the door.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.610
Call me if you need anything.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.380
What are you grinning about?

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.430
Have some fruit.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.710
I didn't expect Mu's issue
to be a peach allergy.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.940
Good thing the doctor said she's fine

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.800
and just needs some allergy meds.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.220
That fight you got into

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.070
was quite unnecessary.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.180
You know that girl well?

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.100
I'd never met her before.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.920
I met Mu on the plane.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.530
She's super nice, and I really like her.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.700
Don't you dare cause them any trouble.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.650
Don't you have something to say to me?

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.340
I'm sorry, Sui.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.170
Today is my birthday.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.780
Happy birthday, Sui.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.530
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.300
♪ Happy birthday to dear Lin Sui ♪

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.340
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.220
Mu had a mild allergic reaction.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.220
It's not serious.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.130
I'm staying with her.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.930
What's wrong?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.470
Who is it?

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.010
She's having an allergic reaction?

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.080
Mu has never been able
to eat peaches since she was little.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.600
She's prone to allergies.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.640
Should we go to the hospital?

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.970
No need.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.610
Jin Zhao is with her.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.750
Mu will feel more at ease that way.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.350
Can I go to your place?

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.570
What do you think?

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.260
Didn't you say last night

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.010
that besides my dad's place,

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:42.490
yours is also my home?

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.970
Let's go to Jin Qiang's first.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.570
Let's go to your place first.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.170
Why are you one person at night

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.610
and another during the day?

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.420
At night you're so gentle with me,

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.530
but during the day

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.660
you're cold and impossible to talk to.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.630
You can't say things like that.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.180
People might misunderstand.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.710
I'm just telling the truth.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.860
Let's go to Jin Qiang's first.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.590
If I go to Dad's place

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.220
and he sees me looking undernourished,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.570
he'll start worrying again.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.490
Besides,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.240
he gets drunk every night.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.650
He can't even take care of himself,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.480
let alone me.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.810
Mrs. Zhao and I aren't related by blood.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.380
She's not my birth mom.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.450
Jin Xin is so young.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.530
Mrs. Zhao gives all her attention to her.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.180
How could she have energy
to take care of me?

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.930
If I go back,

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.220
I won't eat well or sleep well.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.090
A few days later
I'll end up in the hospital again

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.420
for malnutrition.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.380
What am I even supposed to eat
at Jin Qiang's?

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.870
Nothing suits my appetite there.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.090
I'm going to change my clothes first.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.050
Don't come in.
