Have you seen a ghost?

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:29.903
Hey, Yu.

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:31.779
Chou Pin-yu!

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:47.629
Hello, Chi-chi.

00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:49.005
I received your gift.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:50.673
Thank you.

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.508
Hey.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.928
You didn't invite me over when you moved?

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.262
How's it going?

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:59.891
Not bad. Things are going smoothly.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.116
The view from your place…

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.034
…is so beautiful.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.953
Looking at it cheers me up.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.013
Wanna play with me?

00:04:52.438 --> 00:04:58.611
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:02.407
NOVEMBER 2014

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.616
Tell me.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:07.829
At least you're real, yeah?

00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:36.023
Kiss me.

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:01.215
If…

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:07.889
I can… never see again…

00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.519
will you still stay by my side,

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.980
just like this?

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:25.281
Yes.

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.825
Do you want to know… everything?

00:07:15.623 --> 00:07:16.624
No, I don't.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.752
I don't want to know anything.

00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:49.240
Tien-ching.

00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.249
What was with you yesterday?

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:00.710
What happened?

00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:04.255
It's nothing.

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.883
Just something at work

00:08:07.967 --> 00:08:09.552
that made me sad.

00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.763
I didn't scare you yesterday, did I?

00:08:18.853 --> 00:08:20.896
No. You didn't.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.577
If anything ever upsets you,

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:36.996
you can tell me.

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:45.254
Don't worry about me.
I feel better after some rest.

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:55.264
Hi.

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:58.601
I'm Hsiao-tung's high school classmate.

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.439
I'm Hsiao-tung's
high school classmate. Today…

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:06.359
I'm just about to go to Hsiao-tung's.

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:11.614
Her appetite hasn't been great
the past two days.

00:09:11.697 --> 00:09:14.116
She didn't finish the food I made.

00:09:14.992 --> 00:09:18.537
So I'm going to the market to see
if there's anything she likes to eat.

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:21.332
I know.

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:23.751
How can I ask her now

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:26.003
if she fought with that Li Jen-yao?

00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:27.046
Goodness, please.

00:09:59.245 --> 00:10:00.162
LIN'S EATERY

00:10:00.246 --> 00:10:02.873
Sure, have a seat.
Help yourselves to drinks.

00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:49.003
Have a seat.

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:50.379
The menu is on the table.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.841
Sir, it's my first time here.
Any recommendations?

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.096
You were our class leader, Lai Yun-chen.

00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:01.974
You are… Lin Meng-hung.

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.185
LIN'S EATERY

00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:06.812
Who do you still keep in touch with
from our class?

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:09.607
Now, just

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.400
Chuang Jung-tai and Chen Che-li.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.616
You were close to Ouyang Ti, Fan Wei-ting,
and Wang Yu-hsiang too, weren't you?

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:20.201
Don't you talk to them now?

00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:23.871
I grew up.

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:25.623
We're not the same.

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:28.000
We live our own lives.

00:11:32.797 --> 00:11:34.799
What do Che-li and Jung-tai do now?

00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:38.135
Che-li is working at a tech company
in Taoyuan.

00:11:38.219 --> 00:11:41.806
Jung-tai is a PE teacher
at our old school.

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:43.349
Many girls like him.

00:11:45.184 --> 00:11:46.435
And I just…

00:11:47.812 --> 00:11:48.771
You're doing well.

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:51.357
You're your own boss.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.900
No one can mistreat you.

00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:54.777
You're right.

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:57.822
I didn't expect everyone
to be doing so well.

00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:00.991
Not everyone.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.703
Wei-ting was hunted down
by gangsters a while ago.

00:12:06.413 --> 00:12:07.414
Really?

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:09.124
You didn't see it on the news?

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:10.626
Why did he become a gangster?

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:12.044
Gosh, he wouldn't listen.

00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:15.548
He liked to hang out
with Ouyang and Fatty.

00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:18.884
It was bound to happen.
He bit off more than he could chew.

00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:21.220
I don't want to talk about it.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:32.064
-Be careful.
-Okay.

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:04.346
Thank you.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.307
Tell me when you're done.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.349
I'll pick you up.

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:08.893
No need.

00:13:08.976 --> 00:13:11.937
I've already asked Mr. Chiang
to pick me up today.

00:13:12.021 --> 00:13:13.022
Well then,

00:13:14.064 --> 00:13:15.316
I'll come over later.

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:17.526
Okay.

00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:19.528
I'll go up, then.

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:20.863
Okay.

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:51.560
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:52.478
Hey, baby.

00:13:52.561 --> 00:13:56.273
Why are a few bottles
of blood stain remover missing?

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:58.901
How would I know? You take inventory.

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:02.279
Did you not write
"4" and "9" properly again?

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.948
"4" and "9"?

00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:10.329
49, 949, 49, 949.

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:11.622
I'll recheck it for you.

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:12.665
Okay.

00:14:13.415 --> 00:14:14.249
It's almost time.

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.377
I'll pick up Kidney Bean
from school first.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.294
Okay.

00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:28.681
What?

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.186
Nothing. I'm leaving.

00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:36.397
Just so you know.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.360
I'll pay you next week.

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:44.989
What are you going to do next?

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.324
I'm not sure yet.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:50.577
Seriously.

00:14:51.328 --> 00:14:54.081
If you're not sure yet, just work here.

00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:56.000
What's a few more days or months?

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:57.710
You think I'd treat you badly?

00:14:59.962 --> 00:15:01.088
Whatever.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.840
All right. I'm going.

00:15:10.723 --> 00:15:13.058
Do you still remember
your classmate, Fan or Chuang?

00:15:13.142 --> 00:15:15.769
Anyway, he was
one of your trashy classmates.

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:21.358
I heard from a friend that your classmate
was killed by gangsters out to get him.

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:23.402
But just you wait.

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:25.988
This case will be shut down soon.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:28.490
What do you mean exactly?

00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:32.286
This means

00:15:33.537 --> 00:15:34.788
God is watching.

00:15:35.414 --> 00:15:37.332
If prison doesn't do its job, God will.

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.002
So just forget the past.

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:43.964
If you want to leave, fine.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.800
But live well.

00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:47.926
Just like me.

00:15:58.979 --> 00:15:59.813
I get it.

00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.818
Thanks for everything during this time.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.658
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:20.918
What's up with that kid?

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:29.426
In a moment, after the opening,
we'll introduce Mr. Ho and Ms. Chu.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.346
Don't be nervous.
Tien-ching will take care of you.

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:37.309
Tien-ching, what's wrong?

00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:42.272
Okay, let's get ready.

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.919
Welcome to New Life with Classical.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.472
I'm sorry, I got tongue-tied.
One more time.

00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:18.809
Let's start again. Ready.

00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:57.264
Welcome to New Life with Classical.

00:17:57.764 --> 00:17:59.057
I'm Hsia Tien-ching.

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:03.604
We're honored to have
two classical pianists here today

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:08.817
to discuss
when they first got into classical music

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:11.904
and when they started
learning to play the piano.

00:18:28.253 --> 00:18:29.087
Ms. Hsia.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:36.595
It's me, Mr. Chiang.
I'm here to pick you up.

00:18:36.678 --> 00:18:38.639
The car is over there. Let me take you.

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:39.640
Here.

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.320
Be careful.

00:19:07.417 --> 00:19:08.627
Ms. Hsia.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.005
You know, these days, before I go out,

00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:15.050
I always check to see
how my wife is feeling

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:17.302
to decide if I should bring an umbrella.

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:18.804
Hey, I mean it.

00:19:19.388 --> 00:19:21.556
My wife's mood

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.394
is so in sync with Taipei City's weather.

00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:26.812
It's true.

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:30.274
If she scolds me
or throws a fit in the morning,

00:19:30.357 --> 00:19:33.568
there's going to be
storms, rain, and thunder that day.

00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:34.945
It's scary.

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:37.239
However,

00:19:37.322 --> 00:19:40.242
if she smiles when I leave,

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:44.329
it's going to be sunny
the whole day for sure.

00:19:44.413 --> 00:19:45.914
The bigger her smile…

00:19:45.998 --> 00:19:46.915
CHIANG CHIH-CHENG

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.166
…the brighter the sun.

00:19:49.126 --> 00:19:50.252
That's why I say

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:52.629
we're meant to be married.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:26.496
Mr. Chuang.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.165
Why haven't you left yet?

00:20:28.248 --> 00:20:29.082
Right.

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:33.503
I'm substituting for Mr. Chang tomorrow,
so I'm cramming before class.

00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:36.673
I'll leave you to it.
You can take care of the lights.

00:20:36.757 --> 00:20:38.008
-No problem.
-Okay, bye.

00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:39.801
-Bye, get home safe.
-Okay.

00:21:00.322 --> 00:21:01.448
Hello, Lin Meng-hung?

00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:03.533
Did you read about Fan Wei-ting?

00:21:04.659 --> 00:21:05.994
We thought the same thing.

00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:08.163
He must've crossed the line
with his affairs.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.290
That's why he died so tragically.

00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:13.585
Ms. Hsia.

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.046
-You're back?
-Yes.

00:21:16.546 --> 00:21:19.883
It's been raining for two days.
Your clothes just wouldn't dry.

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:21.802
I've put them in the dryer.

00:21:22.302 --> 00:21:25.389
Also, I'm thinking,
since it's getting colder,

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:28.809
I'll organize your clothes
the next time I come

00:21:28.892 --> 00:21:31.478
and change your wardrobe for the season.

00:21:44.658 --> 00:21:47.452
I'll leave if that's all.

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:49.079
-Okay.
-Bye.

00:21:50.122 --> 00:21:51.915
Ms. Chou, wait.

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:55.043
What is it?

00:21:58.004 --> 00:21:59.464
Can I ask

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:01.716
your full name?

00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:03.969
My name?

00:22:04.052 --> 00:22:05.011
Yeah.

00:22:05.512 --> 00:22:06.721
I was just thinking

00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:09.182
you've been helping me out
for a long time,

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:11.810
but I don't think
I've ever asked your name.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:14.020
My name is Chou Mei-yun.

00:22:15.564 --> 00:22:17.190
-Chou Mei-yun.
-Yes.

00:22:17.274 --> 00:22:20.068
"Mei" as in "beautiful."
"Yun" as in "clouds."

00:22:20.152 --> 00:22:21.611
Common and easy to remember.

00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:25.157
I'll leave, then.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.367
-Okay. Bye.
-All right, bye.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.670
CHOU PIN-YU
DATE OF BIRTH: JULY 23, YEAR 1990

00:22:42.007 --> 00:22:46.219
FATHER: CHIANG CHIH-CHENG
MOTHER: CHOU MEI-YUN

00:23:03.778 --> 00:23:05.238
Ms. Chou, is that you?

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.175
Who are you looking for?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.594
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung here?

00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:30.514
No one by that name here.

00:23:30.597 --> 00:23:31.890
Wait.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.059
You're Chiang Hsiao-tung, right?

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:35.852
No, I'm not.

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:37.354
You've got the wrong person.

00:23:38.063 --> 00:23:39.397
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:42.025
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I know it's you.

00:23:42.526 --> 00:23:45.028
Don't act like this. Hear me out, okay?

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:47.781
I don't know what you want.
Just leave, okay?

00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:51.326
I told you. I'm not her,
and I don't know who she is.

00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:53.411
I know you don't want to see me again.

00:23:54.162 --> 00:23:56.957
I also know why you say
you aren't Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.333
But don't do this.

00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:00.377
Let me finish.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.005
Give me a chance to apologize
for what happened back then, okay?

00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:05.257
Listen to me.

00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:08.093
I really didn't want to do that
at the time.

00:24:10.762 --> 00:24:11.680
I only did it

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.808
because Ouyang Ti
and the others forced me.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.685
I'm sorry.

00:24:17.477 --> 00:24:19.354
I'm sincerely sorry about it.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.024
I know I can't make up for my mistake,
no matter what I say.

00:24:23.108 --> 00:24:25.443
But… believe me, okay?

00:24:26.403 --> 00:24:28.530
I hate them as much as you do.

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.616
Really, I hate them.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.035
They wanted to stop me
from talking about what happened.

00:24:34.536 --> 00:24:36.871
-Stop. I don't want to listen.
-They gave me drugs.

00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:39.583
They forced me to do
those unspeakable things to you.

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:42.127
-I don't want to know.
-…bastards like them.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.878
I don't want to know anything.

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:45.797
That wasn't me.

00:24:46.298 --> 00:24:48.133
-I really didn't want to do it.
-Stop.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:50.635
-Believe me, okay?
-I don't want to know.

00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:52.804
I know I was wrong.

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:54.764
I really do.

00:24:54.848 --> 00:24:56.141
I said stop.

00:24:56.224 --> 00:24:57.601
Will you forgive me?

00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:09.029
Hsiao-tung.

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.200
Hsiao-tung.

00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:23.543
Are you done?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.966
If you're really sorry, then drop dead.

00:25:33.887 --> 00:25:35.764
Tien-ching, calm down.

00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.731
Run! Run away!

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:45.899
I will find you.

00:25:45.982 --> 00:25:47.233
I'll find all of you!

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:49.027
I'll kill every single one of you!

00:25:55.575 --> 00:25:58.578
Do you know you're really hurting my arm?

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:28.191
Tien-ching.

00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:31.486
What happened just now?

00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:42.872
Li Jen-yao.

00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:46.418
Could you be any more spineless?

00:26:47.252 --> 00:26:49.921
Didn't you know
that they raped Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:26:50.004 --> 00:26:51.172
And yet you let him go.

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:53.508
If you're too weak to kill, fine.

00:26:54.634 --> 00:26:55.885
But why did you stop me?

00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:02.809
You deserve to rot
more than anyone else, you know?

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:04.644
If it hadn't been for you,

00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:07.439
Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been raped
by those scumbags.

00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:09.649
She suffered so much because of you!

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:11.234
And you?

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:12.944
What did you do?

00:27:13.945 --> 00:27:14.988
Nothing at all!

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.786
How dare you show your face
to Hsia Tien-ching!

00:27:22.662 --> 00:27:24.664
How dare you let her fall for you?

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:29.085
If they hadn't met you,
they wouldn't have suffered.

00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:30.712
It's all your fault.

00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:32.422
Everything is your fault.

00:27:33.423 --> 00:27:34.674
You won't hurt her again.

00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:40.430
So fucking go to hell.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.398
Tien-ching, are you okay?

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:15.984
Please don't open the door.

00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:19.279
I don't know how I can face you now.
I'm sorry.

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:26.286
I'm sorry.

00:29:29.998 --> 00:29:31.791
I don't know what got into me.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.046
I don't know why I did that to you.

00:29:37.547 --> 00:29:40.258
I don't know
why I said those things either.

00:29:42.927 --> 00:29:44.637
I really don't know what happened.

00:31:06.386 --> 00:31:07.720
Are you still there?

00:31:11.474 --> 00:31:12.475
Yes.

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:14.894
I'm here.

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:20.149
Can I ask you a question?

00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:23.152
Go ahead.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.702
When we first met…

00:31:32.787 --> 00:31:34.872
didn't you mistake me for someone else?

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:39.127
At that time…

00:31:42.171 --> 00:31:43.589
did you call me

00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:46.134
Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:52.765
Yes.

00:31:56.602 --> 00:31:59.647
So you thought I was Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.364
Yes.

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:17.081
So later on, you called me…

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:20.918
hung out with me,

00:32:21.002 --> 00:32:22.462
spent time with me,

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:25.298
started dating me,

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:28.676
and told me you liked me…

00:32:33.222 --> 00:32:34.640
It was all because…

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:42.690
you saw me as a stand-in
for Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:13.805
Yes.

00:33:27.026 --> 00:33:28.152
Li Jen-yao.

00:33:29.862 --> 00:33:30.822
What's the matter?

00:33:32.406 --> 00:33:33.866
Do you like me?

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:37.620
Yes.

00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:39.705
Really?

00:33:41.332 --> 00:33:42.250
Really.

00:33:43.626 --> 00:33:45.586
Will you

00:33:46.087 --> 00:33:48.005
suddenly stop liking me one day?

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:50.633
Will you suddenly disappear one day?

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:54.345
Impossible.

00:33:57.098 --> 00:33:58.182
How can you be so sure?

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:01.435
Because

00:34:02.562 --> 00:34:04.522
I finally found you.

00:34:05.148 --> 00:34:06.149
So

00:34:07.441 --> 00:34:08.901
I'll never leave you.

00:34:10.403 --> 00:34:11.362
Ever.

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:22.308
Tien-ching.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.563
Tien-ching.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:43.955
Hey.

00:35:44.664 --> 00:35:46.374
Does this look very painful?

00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:54.298
I'll tell you a secret.

00:35:55.424 --> 00:35:57.176
Compared to the pain you brought them,

00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:00.054
this is nothing at all.

00:36:07.853 --> 00:36:10.189
Why can't you just go away?

00:36:11.023 --> 00:36:12.608
Why must you use your affection

00:36:12.692 --> 00:36:14.902
to remind her now

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:17.780
that she's damaged,
that she'll never recover,

00:36:17.863 --> 00:36:19.198
and that she'll never be

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:22.201
the same Chiang Hsiao-tung she was
before she met you?

00:36:37.925 --> 00:36:41.012
So she won't be in Taipei
next week, right?

00:36:42.138 --> 00:36:43.973
I'll reschedule, then.

00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:45.891
I see.

00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:49.812
Then let's arrange a time to meet
after Lisa returns to Taipei.

00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:53.607
Okay. Bye.

00:37:48.996 --> 00:37:51.082
-Flatten it.
-Ma'am, is business good?

00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:52.375
Mr. Chuang.

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:55.503
How nice of you to ask.
It's been the same as usual.

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:56.921
What brings you here?

00:37:57.004 --> 00:37:59.965
Oh, I was in the area,
so I thought I'd visit you and Hsuan.

00:38:00.049 --> 00:38:01.926
Thank you so much

00:38:02.009 --> 00:38:04.345
for looking out for Hsuan.

00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:07.390
It's nothing.
She's so smart and independent.

00:38:07.473 --> 00:38:08.599
She's fine on her own.

00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:10.017
Don't hold back.

00:38:10.101 --> 00:38:12.937
If Hsuan doesn't behave,
you can smack her.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.230
Really, you can smack her.

00:38:14.313 --> 00:38:16.190
Nah, times have changed.

00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:18.275
Corporal punishment is banned now.

00:38:18.984 --> 00:38:21.362
If I do that
and the Education Ministry finds out,

00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:22.613
I'll be in trouble, right?

00:38:26.117 --> 00:38:28.828
Ma'am, do you mind
if I borrow Hsuan for a bit?

00:38:28.911 --> 00:38:30.371
It's something for school.

00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:31.831
No problem.

00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:34.083
Hsuan, your teacher needs you.

00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.793
I'll handle it here.

00:38:35.876 --> 00:38:37.044
Go with him.

00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.212
Go.

00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:10.953
You really haven't learned.

00:39:11.454 --> 00:39:13.789
You thought going to
the ministry would work

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.375
when reporting me to the school didn't?

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:19.170
-I don't follow.
-Stop pretending.

00:39:19.253 --> 00:39:21.213
The school already told me

00:39:21.797 --> 00:39:23.424
you reported me to the ministry

00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:26.594
for unfair treatment
and corporal punishment.

00:39:26.677 --> 00:39:29.430
The director specifically asked me
to come and talk to you.

00:39:30.014 --> 00:39:31.056
Don't you get it?

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.392
Why do I only target you at school?

00:39:34.685 --> 00:39:36.812
Think about your attitude at school.

00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:40.232
Not to mention your parents
are in jail for drug use and fraud.

00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:42.151
Forget about the teachers at school,

00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:45.279
I bet no one in your class even likes you.

00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:59.084
Do you know what I dislike most about you?

00:40:00.085 --> 00:40:03.339
You know how poor your family is
and how cheap you are,

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:06.425
yet you still fucking give me
those condescending looks.

00:40:09.637 --> 00:40:11.055
As your teacher,

00:40:11.847 --> 00:40:13.891
I'll show you
what it means to know your place.

00:40:13.974 --> 00:40:15.768
When it's time to bow,

00:40:16.268 --> 00:40:17.770
you'd better bow.

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:19.480
I don't get it.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.107
How can someone so lousy become a teacher?

00:40:33.953 --> 00:40:34.995
You're scared?

00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:36.747
So you know fear?

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:41.627
Go ahead, be cockier.

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:43.045
Just you wait.

00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:45.839
I could fucking pin
a few random things on you next week.

00:40:45.923 --> 00:40:48.759
When the school asks your grandma
to withdraw you from school,

00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:51.011
let's see if you're still cocky.

00:41:28.924 --> 00:41:30.926
That's a tough pill to swallow, isn't it?

00:41:34.638 --> 00:41:35.931
If so,

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:38.684
let me help you make things right.

00:41:48.152 --> 00:41:49.069
Hello, honey?

00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:50.738
Hello? Chen Che-li.

00:41:51.822 --> 00:41:53.115
Where exactly are you?

00:41:53.198 --> 00:41:55.117
I'm already in the parking lot.

00:41:55.618 --> 00:41:57.620
I'll be there in about ten minutes.

00:41:57.703 --> 00:42:00.748
You say that every time.
Do you care about this or not?

00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:03.417
Don't you dare drink with your friends
behind my back again.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.086
Okay, don't worry. I'm by the car.

00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:07.630
I'll be right there.

00:42:07.713 --> 00:42:09.465
How much longer do I have to wait?

00:42:09.548 --> 00:42:11.967
Your head injury just healed.
Don't you remember?

00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:18.140
Hello? Do you hear me?

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.643
Hello, Chen Che-li?

00:42:21.268 --> 00:42:22.102
Hello?

00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:24.396
Hello, Chen Che-li?

00:42:26.148 --> 00:42:27.983
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:30.110
Chen Che-li.

00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:33.489
Chen Che-li, stop joking.

00:42:33.572 --> 00:42:35.032
This isn't funny at all.

00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:36.825
Chen Che-li.

00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:38.744
Chen Che-li.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:41.497
Chen Che-li, what's wrong?

00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.124
Chen Che-li!

00:42:44.917 --> 00:42:46.251
Can you hear me?

00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:47.920
Hello?

00:42:48.587 --> 00:42:50.464
Chen Che-li, what exactly--

00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:28.296
