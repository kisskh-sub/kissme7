2 NEW MESSAGES, 8 MISSED CALLS

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:18.516
3 NEW MESSAGES

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.435
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP?

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:22.103
ARE YOU OKAY? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.022
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK UP?

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:35.491
What should I do?

00:02:55.154 --> 00:03:01.411
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.936
Come.

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.150
-Look, it's so easy.
-Hurry up.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.943
Hurry up!

00:03:34.027 --> 00:03:35.486
What are you afraid of?

00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:38.781
Don't open the door.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:14.692
It's me.

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:18.738
What's wrong?

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:22.241
You didn't pick up.
I thought something happened to you.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.330
Why are your clothes wet?

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.667
You came here in the rain?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.557
I'm sorry.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:49.227
I know we had a date today.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:53.398
I thought today's job
was going to be simple,

00:04:53.898 --> 00:04:55.400
and I'd be here sooner.

00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:59.237
I didn't think something would come up.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.114
-I--
-It's okay.

00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:02.115
It's fine.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.950
I wasn't angry.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.743
Just worried about you.

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:07.203
Look.

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:09.539
You're all drenched.

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.167
Go take a hot shower first,
or you might catch a cold.

00:05:13.668 --> 00:05:14.919
I'll get a towel for you.

00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:35.440
Hold her tight!

00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:36.357
Hurry up.

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.192
Come on.

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:40.570
Get up here.

00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:26.092
FAN WEI-TING

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:07.925
You're done showering?

00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:13.598
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.891
Ms. Chou left some food.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.351
It's really delicious.

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:19.061
Let me heat it up real quick.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:22.189
I'll help.

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:23.858
It's okay.

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.153
Heating up food is easy.
I can do it myself.

00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:28.446
Get some rest.

00:08:30.865 --> 00:08:31.699
Okay.

00:09:11.989 --> 00:09:13.324
I'll only ask you once.

00:09:13.824 --> 00:09:15.910
Where is Fan Wei-ting?

00:09:18.454 --> 00:09:19.455
Who are you guys?

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.172
You don't understand simple English,
do you?

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:29.548
I'm asking you…

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:33.177
You want me to ask again?

00:09:33.761 --> 00:09:35.763
I don't know where he is.

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:38.933
I've been looking for him for days too.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.102
You can check my phone.

00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:42.978
I texted him. He didn't even--

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:52.780
Speak!

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:57.535
Okay.

00:09:58.244 --> 00:09:59.995
I'll bring some folks over now, okay?

00:10:06.627 --> 00:10:08.003
He's still missing.

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.047
But his vehicle is nearby.

00:10:10.631 --> 00:10:13.259
Some of Wei-ting's stuff is here.

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:16.679
We also found some receipts.

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:20.307
They are from the past two days.

00:10:21.434 --> 00:10:23.060
So I think

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:25.104
he should still be hiding nearby.

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:26.647
Unlikely he went far.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.070
Do you smell some kind of cleaner?

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:34.947
Is there?

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:01.932
Don't bother searching.

00:11:02.767 --> 00:11:04.101
He's not here.

00:11:13.611 --> 00:11:14.487
Okay.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.863
I'll let you go.

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:17.114
I'm almost at work too.

00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:18.866
It's true. I swear.

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.618
-See you later.
-I'm not lying.

00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:23.370
-Really?
-Are there pictures?

00:11:24.538 --> 00:11:25.956
Tien-ching, there you are.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.000
-Morning.
-Good morning.

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.335
What were you discussing?

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:32.254
We were talking about Joy.
You know Joy, right?

00:11:33.214 --> 00:11:34.924
That new hire in advertising.

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:38.761
I met her when I was working on
sponsorships for my show.

00:11:38.844 --> 00:11:40.179
Yes, that's her.

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:42.765
You know what?
She traveled to New Zealand this week.

00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:46.352
So I thought I might as well ask her
to bring something for me.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:49.313
When I called her,
she told me to call back later.

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.190
She was trying on wedding dresses.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:54.568
Trying on wedding dresses?
Is she getting married?

00:11:54.652 --> 00:11:56.570
Exactly, I thought it was weird too.

00:11:56.654 --> 00:11:58.322
Then I found out

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:00.366
that she's marrying a tomboy.

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:01.951
Joy is so gorgeous.

00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:04.245
But she's a lesbian.
Isn't that unbelievable?

00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:05.746
Not really.

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:09.500
As long as she's happy, it doesn't matter
if she likes men or women.

00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:13.212
No, the point is that her tomboy

00:12:13.295 --> 00:12:16.382
is just a server at a restaurant.

00:12:16.465 --> 00:12:18.843
Hey, I heard that
Joy's family is super wealthy.

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:21.095
If I were her mom,
I'd probably blow a fuse.

00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:22.638
-Seriously.
-Totally.

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:24.139
Wang,

00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:27.768
if I tell you
that my boyfriend is just a cleaner

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.311
who went to jail before,

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:34.358
and I'm just a blind person
who may have to trouble others forever,

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:37.862
then, from your perspective,
which of us is unworthy of the other?

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.530
And who is ruining whose life?

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.908
Or would you say that
my boyfriend and I are a perfect match?

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:50.833
Tien-ching,

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:52.710
I didn't mean it like that.

00:12:52.793 --> 00:12:54.003
Don't say that.

00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:55.880
I just think

00:12:57.047 --> 00:12:59.091
that whether two people like each other

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:02.094
is more important
than meeting social expectations.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:06.015
I think I've found
the topic for this episode.

00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:11.729
"What makes two people
a good match in romance?"

00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:14.023
Let's discuss it this time.

00:13:15.774 --> 00:13:17.151
I'm going to get ready.

00:13:17.234 --> 00:13:18.277
Tien-ching.

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:27.870
Yun-chen,

00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:31.540
I've already told you
what I know about the incident.

00:13:31.624 --> 00:13:33.542
You believe me now, right?

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:39.173
Here's the money.

00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:41.216
Thank you.

00:13:45.262 --> 00:13:47.556
There's one thing you haven't explained.

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.560
What was your role

00:13:52.227 --> 00:13:54.188
in this incident?

00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:58.859
Why do you know so much about it?

00:14:37.898 --> 00:14:38.732
Tien-ching.

00:14:46.824 --> 00:14:47.950
Let's go.

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:04.466
What's wrong?

00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:09.805
I… don't want to care about
what others think of us.

00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:11.890
I just wanna hug you.

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.318
Did something happen to you at work today?

00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:26.113
How come you seem a bit down?

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:30.409
Nothing.

00:15:31.869 --> 00:15:34.705
I'm happy that I can be with you.

00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:36.331
Besides…

00:15:40.085 --> 00:15:42.212
we're going to spend the weekend together.

00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:43.839
Why would I be sad?

00:15:45.257 --> 00:15:46.258
Good.

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:48.260
Where do you want to go?

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:49.887
Should we eat first,

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.680
or do you want to go for a walk?

00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:56.101
Actually, there is a place
that I really want to go,

00:15:56.602 --> 00:15:58.270
but I haven't had the chance yet.

00:16:01.356 --> 00:16:02.608
Where is that?

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.237
I want to go

00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:08.655
to your place.

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.094
One moment.

00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:46.026
Sorry, there isn't an elevator.

00:16:50.072 --> 00:16:53.325
You… can give me your bag and jacket.

00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:56.870
Thank you.

00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:09.299
This is where I live.

00:17:12.344 --> 00:17:13.387
That's it?

00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:17.141
It's my first time here.
Aren't you gonna tell me more?

00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:21.311
Okay.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.774
My place is a bit small.

00:17:28.902 --> 00:17:31.321
I don't have a sofa or TV.

00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:36.034
There is a table in front of you

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:40.038
and a bed further out to your right.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.042
On your right is a window.

00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:46.962
There are lots of shop signs outside.

00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:49.923
They're lit 24 hours a day.

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:53.343
They're too bright for me.

00:17:55.637 --> 00:17:57.264
On your left

00:17:58.223 --> 00:18:00.392
is a bunch of stuff left by the landlord.

00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:01.727
And…

00:18:05.022 --> 00:18:06.356
That's all.

00:18:09.818 --> 00:18:14.281
By the way, if you want to sit and rest,

00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:17.075
I'll clear some space for you.

00:18:17.659 --> 00:18:18.744
It's okay.

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:24.374
Can I walk around on my own for a bit?

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:28.629
Sure.

00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:46.438
That's the window.

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:50.692
A helmet.

00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:52.569
Yours.

00:18:55.197 --> 00:18:56.156
A drawer.

00:18:58.533 --> 00:18:59.368
Keys.

00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:02.663
Is this your CD?

00:19:03.622 --> 00:19:05.374
It's classical music I bought a while ago.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.459
You listen to that?

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:10.796
As long as it's something
you've recommended on your show,

00:19:11.296 --> 00:19:13.048
I'll buy and listen to it.

00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:20.013
Do you want to listen?

00:19:35.862 --> 00:19:38.365
This is Debussy's "Clair de lune."

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:39.866
I really like it.

00:19:40.575 --> 00:19:41.618
I know.

00:19:42.202 --> 00:19:43.203
You've mentioned it.

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:47.332
When you got sick in high school
and started losing your vision,

00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:49.793
you used to fall asleep
to this piece every day.

00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:53.171
When did I tell you this?

00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:55.882
Actually,

00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.553
I heard you say that on your show.

00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:04.308
You said every time you hear this piece,

00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:07.519
every piano note in the quiet night

00:20:09.187 --> 00:20:11.023
feels like a slow step

00:20:11.106 --> 00:20:12.733
down a long, dark corridor.

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:15.902
It feels like

00:20:16.445 --> 00:20:17.988
you are waiting for a certain moment

00:20:19.072 --> 00:20:20.490
and a certain person.

00:20:21.158 --> 00:20:24.536
You always feel like when the music ends,

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.332
the darkness before you will fade,

00:20:29.249 --> 00:20:30.334
and dawn will come.

00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:38.091
The view and the person

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:41.219
you've been waiting for

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:44.431
will appear in front of you.

00:20:49.311 --> 00:20:50.562
I don't understand music.

00:20:51.063 --> 00:20:53.273
So when I first started listening,

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:56.985
I didn't know what I was listening to.

00:21:00.113 --> 00:21:01.239
I only knew

00:21:02.574 --> 00:21:04.368
that this was your favorite music.

00:21:07.287 --> 00:21:08.872
But as I continued to listen…

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.542
I thought of you.

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:18.256
And then, suddenly, I got it.

00:21:23.053 --> 00:21:24.054
It feels like…

00:21:27.766 --> 00:21:30.560
when the music ends…

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:40.946
The person I've been waiting for
will appear in front of me.

00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:51.957
Thank you.

00:21:55.502 --> 00:21:56.711
Why did you say that?

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.262
Because I feel lucky…

00:22:07.639 --> 00:22:08.890
to have met you.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.436
Honestly, I never thought

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:14.271
that one day

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.898
this could happen.

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:20.444
Being in the apartment of someone I like.

00:22:22.154 --> 00:22:23.697
Hearing you say…

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.950
how much you like me.

00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:30.996
Hearing you describe

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.709
how well you remember what I've said.

00:22:39.379 --> 00:22:41.423
What makes me feel even luckier

00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:44.926
is that you like me too.

00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:51.892
Li Jen-yao,

00:22:53.143 --> 00:22:54.436
I am very lucky…

00:22:56.062 --> 00:22:57.355
to have met you.

00:25:32.636 --> 00:25:33.928
Hurry up!

00:25:37.015 --> 00:25:38.391
Fuck, you don't want that?

00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:46.107
Again.

00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:51.446
Film her face.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.782
Nice. Smile.

00:25:58.161 --> 00:25:59.704
Don't open the door.

00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:22.602
I'll go first.

00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:24.354
Who is second? Hold on.

00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:27.399
-You're second. Be my dick.
-Why don't you follow him?

00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:31.111
-You're big.
-Why do you want to be the last?

00:26:31.194 --> 00:26:33.196
What about Che-li?
Have you considered him?

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:34.114
-I…
-Come on.

00:26:34.197 --> 00:26:35.031
Come on, be brave.

00:26:35.115 --> 00:26:36.950
Take this. It will make you hard.

00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:39.160
It stinks!

00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:40.245
What's the matter?

00:26:57.637 --> 00:26:58.930
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:27:25.707 --> 00:27:28.626
Didn't I tell you not to open the door?

00:28:36.277 --> 00:28:37.237
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:38.696
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:28:41.282 --> 00:28:42.951
Is this a dream?

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:46.037
Why can I see?

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.943
How come you're awake?

00:30:03.656 --> 00:30:06.618
I had a nightmare and woke up.

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:08.870
It's okay.

00:30:10.163 --> 00:30:11.289
It's just a nightmare.

00:30:12.123 --> 00:30:13.124
It's not real.

00:30:29.515 --> 00:30:30.975
It's just a nightmare.

00:30:32.894 --> 00:30:33.978
It's not real.

00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:47.867
Insurance card.

00:31:01.798 --> 00:31:02.882
Did you bring it?

00:31:03.716 --> 00:31:04.550
Yes.

00:31:06.302 --> 00:31:07.345
Sorry.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:17.271
Doctor, why can I suddenly see?

00:31:17.355 --> 00:31:20.108
Is there a change in my condition?

00:31:20.608 --> 00:31:24.737
Will I suddenly lose my vision again
after a while?

00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:26.990
Will it get worse afterward?

00:31:27.615 --> 00:31:30.910
Actually, being able to see
is normal for you.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.290
How can that be normal?

00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:39.085
In high school, my optic nerves started--

00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:41.421
I've already told you this before.

00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:44.215
We've done so many exams.

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:46.175
Everything is normal with your eyes.

00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:50.138
None of the exams
showed any abnormalities.

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:52.932
Have you considered

00:31:53.433 --> 00:31:55.226
that your inability to see

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:57.145
wasn't caused by your eyes?

00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:00.732
I suggest you go to
the neurology department for a brain scan.

00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:02.525
You may even want

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:06.029
to consider a consultation
with a psychiatrist.

00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:41.731
FATHER: CHIANG CHIH-CHENG
MOTHER: CHOU MEI-YUN

00:32:41.814 --> 00:32:43.149
Whose names are these?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.235
Aren't my parents called…

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.658
Why can't I remember their names?

00:32:54.077 --> 00:32:55.411
What are their names?

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.289
Why can't I remember?

00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:04.087
Why did I think they were dead?

00:33:04.837 --> 00:33:05.838
They…

00:33:07.048 --> 00:33:08.549
Are they really dead?

00:33:13.721 --> 00:33:15.181
In other news,

00:33:15.264 --> 00:33:19.852
on the morning of the 12th, a body
was found floating near a fishing port.

00:33:19.936 --> 00:33:21.854
The police, firefighters, and coast guard

00:33:21.938 --> 00:33:24.398
responded to the report
and recovered the body.

00:33:24.482 --> 00:33:28.236
The condition of the body suggests
that the man suffered severe head trauma.

00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:30.822
There was no identification,

00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:34.200
and the body was unrecognizable,
having been in water for days.

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:36.035
Dental impressions and DNA analysis

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:38.329
revealed the deceased man's
surname as Fan.

00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:39.831
He was allegedly linked to gangs.

00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:42.166
The police are now investigating

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.003
whether the case was motivated
by a romantic dispute or a gang feud.

00:33:59.183 --> 00:34:00.309
That day,

00:34:01.144 --> 00:34:03.229
those boys weren't the only ones there.

00:34:04.355 --> 00:34:05.815
Chang En-ya was there too.

00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:09.569
And it seemed like
she already knew what would happen.

00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:12.363
When those boys threw
Hsiao-tung onto the table,

00:34:12.446 --> 00:34:14.198
she immediately dragged me away.

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:17.869
I had no idea that
this would happen beforehand.

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:21.539
I wanted to call the police,
but Chang En-ya threatened me.

00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:25.042
She said that if I told anyone,
they would do the same thing to me.

00:34:26.377 --> 00:34:29.589
She even warned me
not to testify against them.

00:34:29.672 --> 00:34:31.716
So you just left Hsiao-tung there?

00:34:32.383 --> 00:34:34.135
I was just a high schooler.

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:36.137
I was innocent.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.306
I didn't do anything wrong. It was them.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:41.893
Are you sure you really were innocent?

00:34:43.519 --> 00:34:47.023
Later on, when the school
asked you what had happened,

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:48.816
you know very well

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:51.319
what you told them.

00:34:57.575 --> 00:34:59.702
Not only did you do nothing
to save Hsiao-tung,

00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:02.163
but you also kicked her when she was down.

00:35:02.872 --> 00:35:05.541
-How dare you say you were innocent!
-It wasn't like that.

00:35:08.127 --> 00:35:09.378
I won't let this go.

00:35:10.546 --> 00:35:11.631
You will all pay

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.217
for what you did to Hsiao-tung.

00:35:24.644 --> 00:35:26.020
LISA MIMI, PARTNERSHIP INQUIRY

00:35:29.732 --> 00:35:32.485
Hello, thank you
for your sincere invitation.

00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:34.403
En-ya is currently in Japan.

00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:37.782
We have informed her
of your invitation and plan.

00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:41.327
We need to wait for her to return
before discussing this further with you.

00:35:42.578 --> 00:35:45.373
SHEN MU TO LISA MIMI
THANK YOU, I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY

00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:11.524
Tien-ching?

00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:33.629
Don't turn on the light.

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:41.262
What's the matter?

00:36:44.307 --> 00:36:45.516
What happened?

00:36:53.274 --> 00:36:54.400
Tell me.

00:36:57.361 --> 00:36:58.654
At least you're real, yeah?

CHUANG JUNG-TAI, 844 FRIENDS

00:37:56.962 --> 00:37:58.005
I'm here again.

00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:00.299
What will you have today?

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:04.512
The usual.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.057
No one's come in yet today?

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.559
-Yeah.
-So I have the place to myself?

00:38:10.643 --> 00:38:11.852
Of course. Pick a seat.

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:16.482
Then I'll take the one closest to you.

00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:22.405
It's been ages. Will you drink with me?

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:24.407
I sell drinks.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.283
I don't drink with customers.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.840
I owe you and Yu an apology.

00:38:41.507 --> 00:38:44.552
You introduced Yu to me,
but I haven't done her any favors.

00:38:45.511 --> 00:38:49.890
I even let that jerk, Hsu Ta-wei,
order her around like she's a maid.

00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:51.725
I'm fine.

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:54.687
Ta-wei is fun.

00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:56.522
How?

00:38:56.605 --> 00:39:00.317
He's a damn stubborn mama's boy.

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:04.155
Whenever I ask him
to decline unprofitable jobs,

00:39:04.738 --> 00:39:05.781
he just ignores me.

00:39:06.282 --> 00:39:09.535
Does he even know how tiring it is
to sustain the company all by myself?

00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:11.912
He has never thought about you

00:39:11.996 --> 00:39:13.122
or me.

00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:15.249
He only thinks about himself.

00:39:15.332 --> 00:39:16.333
Hey.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.794
I want a drink too.

00:39:20.087 --> 00:39:20.963
Make it sweet.

00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:23.174
Isn't it better not to drink?

00:39:27.178 --> 00:39:29.722
Just give me a tiny bit.

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:31.765
It's all your fault.

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:35.144
Good thing you're not married.

00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:57.082
Remember.

00:39:58.292 --> 00:40:00.669
For our good friend's sake…

00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:04.965
you have to keep this secret.

00:41:09.613 --> 00:41:11.490
What happened?

00:41:18.664 --> 00:41:19.915
What is this?

00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:21.792
What happened?

00:41:30.384 --> 00:41:32.219
I went to see Shen Mu yesterday.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.971
Then what?

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:36.974
I'll just ask her.

00:41:39.018 --> 00:41:40.477
The 17th?

00:41:40.561 --> 00:41:42.771
Yesterday was only the 5th.
How is it the 17th?

00:41:43.272 --> 00:41:44.690
Is this broken?

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.275
APRIL 17TH, MONDAY

00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:48.694
It really is the 17th? What's going on?

00:41:48.777 --> 00:41:49.862
TA-WEI

00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:51.488
-Chou Pin-yu!
-Hi, Ta-wei.

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:54.241
Don't fucking tell me
that you're still sleeping.

00:41:55.576 --> 00:41:57.703
No, I'm already on my way.

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:58.912
You're still on the way?

00:41:58.996 --> 00:42:00.289
What? Still on the way?

00:42:00.873 --> 00:42:02.791
Ta-wei, I'm sorry.

00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:06.003
Could you first tell me
what we're doing today?

00:42:06.587 --> 00:42:09.048
Didn't I tell you yesterday
we're meeting an investor?

00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:11.008
You even set the time and place yourself.

00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:12.885
What's going on with you, Chou Pin-yu?

00:42:17.598 --> 00:42:19.558
I told you. We should've taken the stairs…

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:23.479
Sis, I don't remember anything
after I visited you that day.

00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:26.190
Suddenly, a few days have passed.
What exactly happened?

00:42:26.732 --> 00:42:28.317
Did you take me home that day?

00:42:28.817 --> 00:42:30.778
Did I say anything to you afterward?

00:42:32.237 --> 00:42:35.366
Can I come over after work?
I need to talk to you about something.

00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:37.201
Chou Pin-yu.

00:42:37.743 --> 00:42:40.454
How many times have I told you?
Don't text and chat at work.

00:42:40.537 --> 00:42:41.705
Sorry.

00:42:42.331 --> 00:42:43.624
Which number is it?

00:43:06.188 --> 00:43:07.022
Tien-ching?

00:43:23.372 --> 00:43:25.040
What a coincidence.

00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:26.166
Why are you here?

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.793
It's been so long.

00:43:27.876 --> 00:43:29.086
How have you been?

00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:31.046
Are you here to see a doctor?

00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:43.600
We're here for work.

00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:46.270
I'm her boss. Hello.

00:43:46.353 --> 00:43:47.438
Hello.

00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:51.233
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:53.152
I'm Joy.

00:43:54.945 --> 00:43:56.488
Hey, Yu.

00:43:56.989 --> 00:43:58.240
What's that look for?

00:43:59.283 --> 00:44:00.409
What's wrong?

00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:03.537
You know, you did me
a huge favor back then.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:05.289
I've always wanted to thank you.

00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:09.251
-I've been meaning to.
-Yu?

00:44:09.334 --> 00:44:10.502
-Back at the radio…
-Yu?

00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:12.546
Lucky you were there for me.

00:44:12.629 --> 00:44:14.882
So everything went well
for me and my wife.

00:44:15.507 --> 00:44:16.717
Tien-ching?

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:19.511
-Yu?
-Are you okay?

00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:20.721
Yu?

00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:21.930
Hey, you're scaring me.

00:44:23.015 --> 00:44:24.224
Yu.

00:44:24.725 --> 00:44:26.185
Chou Pin-yu.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:57.445
