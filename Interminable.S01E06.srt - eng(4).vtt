Kaew.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.240
Before I passed out, I saw Khun Yai there.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.360
Tell Kaew, your son, to come to me if he wants to know anything.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.120
A ring?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.440
He told me that if you see this ring, you might remember something.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.480
Remember what?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.880
I don’t know.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.960
Why is Khun Yai in that room?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.520
Something is definitely going on.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.320
I must find out about it.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.200
Khun Yai?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
Khun Yai?

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.480
Saen?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.320
Khun Yai, are you in here?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.760
Saen?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.520
What is this place?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.520
Chao Meun Samur Jairatch has made a will to pass on this white house to his living descendant.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.120
Khun Kaewta is the only relative that’s still alive.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
A relative?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.920
How could I be related to someone of a high ranking like that?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.920
It’s your favourite song, dear.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.640
Do you still remember?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
This can’t be.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.040
Who are you? How did you get in here?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720
You can see him, Khun Kaew?

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.240
Don’t be funny, Saen. Of course I can see him. I have eyes.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.840
He can see you!

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.040
A friend? Judging from your age, it’s hard to believe you’re Khun Phra Nai’s friend.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.120
Is friendship limited by a person’s age?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.480
I never know that.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.360
Is it possible that someone I saw in my dream
would also exist in real life as if they’re the same person?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.840
Does this mean…Khun Yai is Chao Meun Samur Jairatch?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.360
No.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.160
No!

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.560

Go away!

Have you forgotten the promise you gave me?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.520
Please don’t leave me again, dear.

What are you afraid of, Khun Kaew?

Saen and Nanny are also not human…

Khun Yai has been waiting for you for so long.

Are you going to leave him again?

What happened, Kaew?

You can tell me. I can help you.

No, Ruedee. You can’t do that.

Finally, you came.

What’s wrong, dear? Why are you here?

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.640

Past life, sir?

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.000
Yes, because of a promise.

A promise…

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.160
What should I do to be free from it, Luangta?

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.400
Atone for one’s sins.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.400
Can we do that, sir?

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.920
Making merits in this life, to be together in the next.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.800
Is it true or just a belief that it would make us be together in every life?

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.920
Keep making merits together,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.440
and maintain the same moral foundation.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.600
And you shall find each other, always.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.160
I see. So, it’s not just a belief then.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.680
Can I join you to make merits like this every day?

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.760
No longer bound by promises.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.520
Never to see each other again, whether in this life…

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.200
…or any other life.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.000
And be parted forever?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.560
No.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.040
I don’t want that.

Kaew!

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.120
Think about it carefully, dear.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.040
But deep down,

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.000
that’s how I feel, Mum.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.520
What promise did I give him?

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.440
Why is it torturing him like this?

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.240
And why does it hurt so much to see him in pain?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.400
I really don’t understand.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.920
The reason he has to suffer like this…

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.120
…is because of me, isn’t it, Luangta?

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.920
Go back before it’s too late.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.920
What do you mean, Luangta?

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.200
Ruedee, what’s going on?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.320
Well, Kaew, it’s…

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.200
It’s here.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.480
The white house.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.800
You know this place?

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.400
Yes.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.680
I want him out of Kaewta’s life.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.080
As for other demons,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.320
feel free to do as you like.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.800
Dad.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.280
What is it?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.720
Who dare trespassing into the area of the white house?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.240
You maggots! Don't you know where your place is?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.160
How dare you bring a shaman to this place?

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.400
Because you lot don't stay where you belong.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.640
And keep messing with Kaewta’s life.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.840
It’s you who is messing with his life!

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.320
I’m protecting him from demons like you!

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.680
Fuck off!

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.160
Dad!

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.040
Dad!

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.920
You!

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.200
That one’s not a ghost!

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.640
Go get him!

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:51.960
Come!

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.840
Sin!

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.080
Let me go!

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.440
Dad!

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.240
Still not afraid?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.520
Fine.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.160
Dad!

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.360
Khun Yai!

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.960
Khun Yai!

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.320
Khun Yai!

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
Get off me!

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160
- Khun Yai!
- Khun Yai!

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.760
Khun Yai!

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.560
Khun Yai!

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.720
Khun Yai!

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.960
Khun Yai!

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.800
Khun Yai!

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.680
Khun Yai!

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.680
Khun Yai!

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.320
Saen…tell everyone to run away.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.680
No, sir!

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.320
Saen!

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.240
I’ve never disobeyed your order, Khun Phra Nai.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.240
But this time, I must do it.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.760
You scumbag! You dare hurt Chao Meun Samur Jairatch!

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.640
You shall go to hell!

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.480
Don’t!

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.200
So stubborn. Eat this!

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.400
Dad!

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.560
Let me go!

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.840
Dad!

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.560
Let me go!

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.640
Did Kaewta ask you to do this?

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.920
You and I, we’ve never had a dispute.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.720
It’s because you meddle with Kaewta’s life first.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.960
Ghosts should only stay with ghosts. I have to protect Kaewta!

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.160
Protect him?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.800
Khun Yai, don’t waste your time negotiating with them!

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.880
Stop, Saen!

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.280
Kaew probably forgets about me by now.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.880
Please hang in there, Khun Yai.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.600
Wait for me.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.240
No way.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.320
Khun Kaew will never forget about you.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.320
He will remember it soon.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.320
Forget about what?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.680
Do you and Kaew know each other?

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.560
In the past life, Khun Kaew and Khun Yai were lovers.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.640
Lovers?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.200
Yes, lovers.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.040
Now that you know, you should leave.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.920
Don’t interfere with our affairs!

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.640
Get out!

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.640
I can’t do that.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.680
Humans and ghosts live in a different world.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.880
How can they be together?

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.840
Doing this…don’t you think you’re being selfish?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.960
You should let it go.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.760
Take your people’s spirits back to where they belong and go reincarnate.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.000
If you don’t let them go first,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.600
they won’t be able to leave you.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.360
Stop talking rubbish!

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.480
You will never understand him!

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.520
If you still refuse to listen,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.800
I’m afraid I’ll have to do this.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.400
Khun Yai!

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.280
Khun Yai!

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.480
What are you gonna do?

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.640
What are you gonna do?

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.000
I’ll never let you hurt my people again!

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.640
Khun Yai, please stop!

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.440
If you keep doing that, your spirit might be lost forever!

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.560
If Kaew has already forgotten about me,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.000
I’d rather have my soul disappeared forever.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.120
No, no!

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.360
Without me…

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.480
all of you will finally be free from this place.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.640
And go on your own ways.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.880
This way…

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.920
…is best for all of us.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.680
Khun Yai!

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.480
Khun Yai!

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.520
Let me go!

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.760
Die!

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.600
Die!

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.800
Stop!

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.200
Khun Yai.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.640
Don’t hurt them!

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.840
You all can go to hell!

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.360
Don’t!

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.400
Don’t!

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.040
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.880
Chai.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.160
Please don’t hurt Khun Yai and everyone here.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400
Kaew…

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.560
But these people can hurt you.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.600
Please take your men back.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.640
But Kaew…

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.120
I’m begging you.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.520
You can go now.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.360
Go!

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.360
Guys, let’s go.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.320
Dad, Khun Yai, Dad, Dad!

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.320
Dad.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.360
- Saen!
- Dad!

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.360
Khun Yai! Khun Yai.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.080
Khun Yai!

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.560
Khun Yai!

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.200
Are you all right, Khun Yai?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.320
Kaew.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000
You finally came back to me?

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.120
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.920
You remember me now, don’t you?

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.280
Not yet.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.560
But I will. I promise you.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.400
Can you wait for me?

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.880
Yes, I’ll always wait for you.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.520
Khun Yai…Khun Yai!

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.320
Sin, please take me to see Khun Yai.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.160
Let’s go.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.480
Kaew!

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.240
Ruedee!

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.400
Luangta Cham asked me to give you this.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.160
Miss Ruedee, I’ll go check on Khun Yai first.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.920
Give it to Kaew, in case he wants to know.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.080
But only until a stick of incense is burnt out.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.080
Kaew.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.840
Can you not find out about it?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.679
Even though you and him used to be lovers,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.840
you two now live in a different world.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.679
You’ve reincarnated as another man.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:24.719
What good would it do to find out about your past life?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.800
Yes, it would.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:40.239
At least, it might help ease off this indescribable pain in my heart.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.560
Go ahead, Khun Kaew.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.520
Let's go out.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.000
Geez, Kaew.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.360
What’s wrong with you?

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.840
I’m sorry, Uncle.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.360
If Kaew can’t focus like this, let’s just postpone the practice to another time.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.440
Maybe…because there’re too many people here.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.600
Good idea. Let’s take a break then.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.760
So that I can discuss some business with Khun Phra Nai.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.280
Don’t worry, sir. I’m not in a hurry.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.320
But my dancer seems to have lost his spirit already.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.640
Kaew.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.160
You will be punished.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.320
What is he looking at?

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.200
Lady Chuichai!

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.360
Move!

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.800
Lady Chuichai!

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.960
A man?

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.600
Or is he still wondering if I’m a woman?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.840
How upsetting! I got punished because of him.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.520
How could he still smile after getting someone into trouble?

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.920
Khun Phra,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.320
I think we should be very careful when it comes to something important like this.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.840
Yes, sir. I’ll have a thorough check on it again.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.760
Good.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.800
Kaew, are you done wiping?

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.640
Yes, Uncle.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.400
Go tell the servant to prepare some refreshments for Khun Phra Nai.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840
Yes, sir.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.080
Come, let’s get going then.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.280
Yes.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.800
Khun Yai! Khun Yai!

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.280
Kaew! Why did you do that?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.960
I didn’t mean it, sir. My hand just slipped.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.240
I’m fine, sir. Kaew didn’t mean it. Please don’t blame him.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.280
Kaew, go fetch him some medicine now.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.880
Yes, sir.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.240
You lot can go home now.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.080
My apologies, sir.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.200
Don’t worry. You didn’t mean it.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.120
So, where are your servants, Khun Phra Nai?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.360
Please call me by my name.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.920
How could I?

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.680
Sure, you can.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.120
We aren’t strangers.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.200
You’re an adopted son of Luang Sanor, the man I respect.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.240
So, we’re acquaintances.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.560
I wonder where Saen’s gone fooling around.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.480
But this is exactly how it should be.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.280
How so?

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.680
You made me get hurt.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.320
So, you must be responsible for it.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.360
That’s how it should be.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.440
You probably feel better now. Please excuse me then.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.080
What are you prying on?

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.200
Are you all right?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.640
It’s your fault. You gave me a fright.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.880
How could you blame it on me? You fell off on your own.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.320
That’s because you came near me.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.960
I got surprised, and then I…

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.640
Ruedee!

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.000
Kaew!

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.720
How is it going?

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.200
All good now.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.800
Let’s go.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.200
Yes!

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.960
Ouch!

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.240
That was quite a blow, Saen.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.680
Does it still hurt?

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.360
Geez.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.080
It probably doesn’t hurt that much.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.840
Look at all that smiley face despite getting punched.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.680
Doesn’t it hurt, Khun Yai?

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.880
Who’s hurt?

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.480
Brother!

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.600
Sophee.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.360
Are you back?

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.640
Oh dear.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.400
Did you get into a fight with anyone?

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:30.080
Oh, it’s nothing. I was being careless.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.000
I…

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.640
I bumped my face against a pole at Luang Sanor’s place.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.360
A pole?

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.800
But the bruise looks more like you were punched, sir.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.040
Hmm, you seem to be an expert in this.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.240
Perhaps, is it because you often get into a fight?
That’s why you can tell it apart.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.760
You!

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.920
It’s Saen.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.000
Som.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.040
Do you want me to tend to the wound for you?

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.320
Som, fetch me the first-aid kit.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.840
Oh, it’s all right.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.360
I already took care of it at Luang Sanor’s place.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.280
Let’s go, Saen.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.520
Wait.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.320
You seem to go to Luang Sanor’s place quite often lately. Is there something going on?

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.880
I’ve been assigned to work on a project with him.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.920
So, we have some discussion to make.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.920
I see. That’s why you hardly have time for me.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.360
I’m afraid so.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.640
Perhaps, is there something you want from me, Sophee?

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.400
So pretty, Som.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440
Me, Miss?

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.320
- The umbrella.
- Oh, yes, Miss.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
There are only beautiful things here.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.680
This one also looks perfect for you, Miss.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.680
Oh, look at that, Miss!

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.280
So beautiful!

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.880
It's so beautiful, som.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.600
I completely agree.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.000
Thank you, Brother. If it weren’t for you, Father would’ve never let me come here.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.640
It’s quite relaxing to be out and hanging around like this.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.200
Yes.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.040
I’m glad that you’re happy.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.160
Yes.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.160
Som.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.040
Yes, Miss?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160
Look at this.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.360
It suits you very well, Miss.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.520
This one is also pretty.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.840
Where on earth are Kan and Ruedee?

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.640
Isn’t that Lady Chuichai, sir?

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.880
Kaewta.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.120
Saen.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:49.680
Yes, sir?

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.600
- Keep watch here.
- Yes, sir.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.640
Will he get away with it though?

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.680
This one looks pretty too, Lady Sophee. How about this one?

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.280
Yes, Miss.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.440
This one on the right, Miss.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.320
Yes, that’s perfect.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.280
Where are those two?

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.920
Khun Phra Nai.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:28.920
Kaewta.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:36.320
♫May the wind carry this song…♫

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:44.560
♫…in my heart to you ♫

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:53.240
♫No matter for how long, I’ll always love you ♫

00:49:53.240 --> 00:50:02.560
♫I’ll love you…until the time is through ♫

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.600
[Next Episode]
When krathongs float side-by-side like this, they say that...

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.360
...if it's a loving couple, their love will last forever.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.240
It's not strange for the krathongs to float side-by-side.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.880
We launched them from the same spot.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.520
Then why did you leave immediately when you saw I came to find you?

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.960
Didn't Khun Yai come to discuss business with my uncle?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.760
But perhaps business is just an excuse... to let me come and see you. Don't you know that?

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:37.120
I knows you've grown up and have your own thoughts and judgment

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.880
But I still wants you to be cautious

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.280
Don't let your heart stray beyond what is proper

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.600
Otherwise, you will make a mistake and regret it

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.880
The plot for EP 6, wow, will they find out?

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.680
Isn't it the moment where you'll know the truth?

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.400
-The investigation into what this
room is has begun.
-They've started to suspect.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.160
So, I drugged him.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.720
-Oh, because Sin usually guards it, so you just knocked him out.
-Yes.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.800
-And did you find it this time?
-Was he drugged in the next episode? I'm not sure.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.880
I was stunned. It was unexpected.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.080
It felt... not right.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.120
-Not right?
-It was like, "Hey!"

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.520
Was all the food I've eaten just my imagination?

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.000
The food you made for me.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.560
But maybe you saw something else?

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.040
But I saw chili paste with mackerel.

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.040
-Yes, actually...
-When I was eating, it might have been worms.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.320
Exactly. It was actually rocks.
I was cooking in the kitchen with Nom Yaem.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.720
See? It's always like this.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.960
So I... was shocked, thought I was tricked.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.280
Yeah, you were actually tricked, but it's okay.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.240
Allowing him to trick you means you love him.

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.400
See, it's always like that.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.040
I won't allow it.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.440
Okay, let's find out! Let's go!

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.480
Sin, wake up!

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.120
Sin, wake up!

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.920
[Too late. Kaewta walks past Sin.]

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.880
[Slowly opens the door and descends.]

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.080
[Walking down]

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.960
[Walking down]

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.440
[Billy stands up and walks away]

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.560
[Billy stands up and walks away]

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.520
We're safe, we're outside now. Come on, hurry!

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.320
Come outside quickly!

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.680
Phew.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.960
This is a really tormenting location.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.240
I hope this is the...

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.440
second most difficult thing,
after wearing the traditional dance outfit.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.400
[This must be a good story,
because these are good stories.]

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.720
This is a fortress.

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.680
Back in the day during wars,
this place was used for positioning cannons.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.040
And it seems to be an air-raid shelter too.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.840
And this here is a walkway

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.040
but we put a barrier to make it look like an underground area.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.280
And there are other setups and things.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.720
So, we could only enter and exit through one narrow way.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.640
The door is this small.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.480
And we had to carry cameras and equipment inside.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.360
It's so stuffy.

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.320
Like roasted chicken.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.200
But it's good that it's not sunny outside anymore.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.640
It's still hot inside anyway.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.760
Wait and see the next scene. It's not over yet.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.920
Kaewta.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.440
Kaewta.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.600
Kaew!!

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.600
Kaew!

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.160
Kaew!

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.840
I'll take you to see.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.400
Oh, don't cry. I already let you hug me.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.480
As you can see.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.320
I haven't even spoken yet.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.160
You're going to cry again.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.240
Well done.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.160
-This scene is the saddest.
-Yes.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.000
Because he has been waiting for a hundred years.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.720
I thought this was the moment he would remember.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.960
But it turned out he was afraid of me.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.320
And ran away from my life, so...

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.240
Seeing that, I was shocked.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.520
I was just shocked.
