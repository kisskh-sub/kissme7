MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.374
APRIL 2014

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:20.667
Hey!

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.544
One, two, three, freeze!

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:26.047
One, two, three, freeze!

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:27.841
Oh, no.

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:29.717
One, two, three, freeze!

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:31.636
I got you!

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.471
I'm the devil!

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:35.515
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.560
After you're released, if you don't know
where to go, come find me.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:44.899
You can be the devil.

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:45.817
Your turn.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.318
One, two, three, freeze!

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:16.472
Kiddo!

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:22.395
Gosh. You really came to me.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.869
Where is Ouyang? Tell me!

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.747
Hand him over. Then you and I are even.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.084
You just got out.
Do you wanna get locked up again?

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.420
Even if I tell you, what can you do?

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:48.838
You're on your own.

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:51.966
Do you think you can kill them all?

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.551
Do you know what could happen?

00:01:54.552 --> 00:01:55.887
I don't care.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:57.972
You don't care.

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:00.308
But what about your sweetheart?

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:02.769
Have you asked her?

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.562
Does she want you to do this?

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:09.025
Maybe she's already started a new life.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:13.279
Is this… helping her or hurting her?

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.837
Don't you want to see Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.182
Where is she?

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:42.976
I don't know.

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:46.813
But I'm good at finding people.

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.901
I used to collect debts. You know that.

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.279
Wherever she's hiding,

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.406
I can help you find her.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.366
But you have to promise me.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.660
Stay here and work for me

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.662
until I find her.

00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:06.332
And don't go around causing trouble.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:38.841
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:40.676
Mrs. Ouyang.

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:45.306
Do you recognize this person?

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:51.521
I do.

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:55.441
He is…

00:04:57.777 --> 00:04:59.362
Li Jen-yao.

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:02.407
This fateful Christmas Eve
at around 11:00 p.m.,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.285
a horrific murder occurred
during a home invasion in Taipei.

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.871
Legislator Ouyang Hsiang's eldest son,
Ti, was killed.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:12.208
The police have identified the suspect
from security footage.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.293
The suspect, Li, and the victim

00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:16.462
reportedly had a dispute seven years ago.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.464
They were once high school classmates--

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:28.015
Wang Yu-hsiang.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:29.976
What's wrong with you?

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.893
Are you unwell?

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:32.603
Why the outfit?

00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:35.606
Just having a meal with a friend.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.483
Say you're not going.

00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:40.820
I'm going to be late.

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:48.619
Fuck you.

00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:55.376
What the heck? What are you doing?

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.129
Let go!

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.175
Fuck.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:08.556
Let go!

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:11.142
-Let go!
-Go to hell!

00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:17.607
Bitch! Fucking bitch!

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.942
-Fucking bitch!
-Go to hell!

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.528
Let go of me!

00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:23.696
Go to hell!

00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:26.115
-What are you doing?
-What the heck?

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:33.331
Shih-yu.

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:36.375
Shih-yu, where are you?

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:39.212
Shih-yu.

00:06:39.712 --> 00:06:41.088
Where are you?

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.798
Shih-yu.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.302
Where are you?

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:47.845
Shih-yu.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.640
Where are you?

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:53.309
Shih-yu.

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:56.896
Shih-yu.

00:06:58.231 --> 00:06:59.315
Where are you?

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.444
Shih-yu.

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:06.447
Shih-yu.

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:12.119
Shih-yu.

00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:16.082
Found you.

00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:24.674
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.847
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.812
The suspect, Li Jen-yao,
and the victim, Ouyang Ti,

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:39.480
reportedly had a dispute seven years ago.

00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:41.232
But the real motive for the murder

00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:44.402
can only be found out
when the suspect is arrested.

00:07:44.485 --> 00:07:47.572
We will continue to follow this story
and keep you updated.

00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:51.492
Shouldn't Ouyang Ti have been the last?

00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.452
Why did you kill him first?

00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:55.538
And you were seen on camera.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.999
When I went to Hsiao-tung's that day,

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.668
I think Ouyang Ti was following me.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:02.920
He might have found her.

00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:04.922
That's why I acted immediately.

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:06.716
I called you

00:08:07.258 --> 00:08:09.594
because Hsiao-tung's place
might not be safe.

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:11.345
Take her away quickly.

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:12.513
Don't worry about it.

00:08:13.014 --> 00:08:15.641
You, on the other hand,
are wanted by the police.

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:16.934
Can you get Wang Yu-hsiang?

00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:19.395
If not, I will.

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:20.313
No.

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.148
Just remember one thing.

00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:24.317
Take good care of Hsiao-tung.

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:26.360
The rest

00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:28.279
is my responsibility.

00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:33.618
Later on, no matter what happens,

00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:35.995
I won't contact you again.

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.706
You just have to remember our pact.

00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:42.585
Pretend you don't know anything, or me.

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:57.141
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:59.518
I'm sorry!

00:09:02.063 --> 00:09:02.897
Sorry!

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:10.196
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:16.035
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:25.294
Mommy, I'm sorry!

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.213
Absolutely. Sure.

00:09:27.922 --> 00:09:30.174
At my place. Yes, I'm home.

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:34.303
It's on me.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.557
Who else did you invite? Amber.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.478
Bring Angela along.

00:09:43.062 --> 00:09:44.980
Those two were popular last time.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.900
Mr. Chen and the others quite liked them.

00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:51.779
Jen-yao, don't come out.

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:53.197
Be good.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.991
Stay inside. It'll be okay, all right?

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:57.993
Move the fuck aside!

00:09:58.077 --> 00:10:00.413
-What are you doing? No!
-Move aside! Get lost!

00:10:00.496 --> 00:10:02.707
Just hit me. Hit me. Stop hitting Jen-yao.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.709
-Don't!
-Fuck.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:06.377
Why are you pulling me away?

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:09.588
-He's so young and already talking back.
-Don't!

00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:11.882
And you're fucking telling me
not to hit him?

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:14.051
-How will he turn out?
-He saw you hitting me.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:14.969
Go away!

00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:16.804
He wanted to protect me.

00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:17.888
You beat him up.

00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:19.432
Get out of the way!

00:10:20.099 --> 00:10:21.559
UNCLE COW'S STEAKHOUSE

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:07.646
Hello.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.524
I'm Wen-ling's
high school classmate Lai Yun-chen.

00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:13.110
Hey.

00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:16.781
Let her come in and take a look.

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:26.749
About two weeks ago,
Wen-ling suddenly came home one day

00:11:26.832 --> 00:11:28.542
and locked herself in her room.

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:32.046
She kept saying a ghost was haunting her.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:34.965
She's clearly having mental issues,

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:37.760
but we can't force her to see a doctor.

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:42.598
We… really don't know what to do.

00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:46.143
Can I go in and see Wen-ling?

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:49.104
If I talk to her about high school

00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:51.273
and help her recall happy memories,

00:11:51.774 --> 00:11:53.275
she might get better sooner.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.493
Okay. Please be careful.

00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:34.692
WAY-YA STUDIO, ADULT VIDEOS, ADULT PHOTOS

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.410
I was going to let you die.

00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:49.039
But now I think
it's better to keep you alive.

00:12:57.298 --> 00:12:59.300
You left Hsiao-tung in that hell.

00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:01.385
Now it's your turn.

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:05.222
No one will save you.

00:13:06.307 --> 00:13:08.017
You can stay in this hell.

00:13:08.893 --> 00:13:10.019
Grieve for Hsiao-tung.

00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:15.024
Hsiao-tung.

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:18.235
Hsiao-tung.

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:20.362
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.489
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:13:23.073 --> 00:13:24.658
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:26.535
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:52.853
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:55.940
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:13:56.023 --> 00:13:57.274
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:13:58.317 --> 00:14:02.988
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I'm sorry!

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:36.146
Fuck!

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:39.566
No! What do you want?

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.735
Stay away.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.405
No. Fuck!

00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:46.323
Fuck!

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:53.998
Wang Yu-hsiang, what are you doing?
You're so damn loud.

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.667
My wife's innocent.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.169
She doesn't know you!
You wouldn't kill the innocent.

00:15:00.004 --> 00:15:02.381
I'm going to the US tomorrow for good.

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:03.757
Like I'm dead!

00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:05.092
Don't!

00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:14.101
Don't.

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:30.868
Don't.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.629
Don't.

00:15:46.925 --> 00:15:47.760
Fuck!

00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:07.946
Don't.

00:16:08.447 --> 00:16:10.032
Let… me explain.

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:11.241
Let me explain.

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.369
I don't think
I raped Chiang Hsiao-tung that day.

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:18.373
I… I really didn't rape Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:22.711
There were so many people.
I couldn't even get hard.

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:26.840
I really didn't!

00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:28.884
I didn't! I…

00:16:31.053 --> 00:16:32.179
I'll give you money.

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:34.848
I'll give you money.
Lots of it. As much as you want.

00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:36.517
My wife is rich too.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.810
It's all yours.

00:16:37.893 --> 00:16:39.603
Don't. Wait, you…

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:25.315
Don't forget about me.

00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:11.236
No! Don't take it! No!

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.321
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:13.238
No!

00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:15.032
Get lost!

00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:17.409
Please!

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:19.328
-Why are you grabbing me?
-Please.

00:18:24.124 --> 00:18:26.043
Didn't I say I'd pay you back

00:18:26.126 --> 00:18:27.920
with some extra next week?

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.089
This is what Jen-yao has sent me.
I can't give it to you!

00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:33.342
You're making me do this.

00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:34.718
Come here! Give it to me.

00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:37.471
Or I'll beat you. You're asking for it.

00:18:38.805 --> 00:18:39.640
Give it to me.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.934
I'll pay you back. What are you doing?

00:18:42.017 --> 00:18:43.268
No!

00:18:43.852 --> 00:18:44.686
Please.

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:50.275
Give it to me.

00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.052
Jen-yao, don't do this.

00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:18.929
I was wrong.

00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:21.098
I'll go with you, okay? I'll go with you.

00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:23.976
I promise I'm done with him.
Don't do this.

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.185
I'm begging you.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:27.521
Listen to me. I'll go with you.

00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:30.107
No, don't do this. Don't.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.024
Jen-yao.

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:43.787
Jen-yao, listen to me. Listen, okay?

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.997
Listen to me.

00:20:38.425 --> 00:20:39.343
Mom.

00:20:42.596 --> 00:20:44.556
Take good care of yourself from now on.

00:20:47.893 --> 00:20:49.353
I won't be coming back.

00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:24.805
Hello? I'm Li Jen-yao.

00:21:25.597 --> 00:21:26.765
I killed someone.

00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:30.435
I am at Lane 16, Ching-chuan Street.

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:41.363
Don't you know?

00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:43.031
-He even killed his own dad.
-What?

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.493
Yeah, why did he do that?

00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:48.036
-I don't get it.
-He's out.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.623
Li Jen-yao,
why did you kill so many people?

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:52.791
What was your motive?

00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:55.419
-Do you feel guilty?
-You even killed a child!

00:21:55.502 --> 00:21:57.003
Could you explain?

00:21:57.087 --> 00:21:58.630
Who's that influencer to you?

00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:01.258
-Why did you kill them?
-What was the feud about?

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:03.552
Li Jen-yao, would you like to explain?

00:22:03.635 --> 00:22:05.929
-What did that influencer do?
-Could you explain?

00:22:06.012 --> 00:22:06.888
Look this way.

00:22:06.972 --> 00:22:09.266
-Please tell us.
-Li Jen-yao, any comment?

00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:10.725
Camera is here, Li Jen-yao.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.253
Li Jen-yao!

00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:40.338
-What was the feud about?
-Please explain!

00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:41.298
Li Jen-yao!

00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:02.694
What did you do
after killing Wang Yu-hsiang and his wife?

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:05.405
What did their child do to you?

00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:08.992
Why didn't you spare him?
What did he do wrong?

00:23:19.252 --> 00:23:21.546
Don't forget about me.

00:23:29.137 --> 00:23:31.556
If it hadn't been for you,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.478
Mommy wouldn't have cried so much.

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:38.313
It's all your fault.

00:23:38.396 --> 00:23:41.525
Everything is your fault.

00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:45.737
If it hadn't been for you,

00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:48.365
Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been like this.

00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:55.247
If it hadn't been for you…

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:01.169
If it hadn't been for you,

00:24:01.253 --> 00:24:03.547
we wouldn't have been in so much pain.

00:24:05.423 --> 00:24:10.011
If it hadn't been for you…

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:12.180
If it hadn't been for me…

00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:17.143
Everything is your fault.

00:24:17.227 --> 00:24:19.020
Everything is my fault.

00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:22.065
Everything is your fault.

00:24:22.148 --> 00:24:23.316
Everything is my fault.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.402
If they hadn't met you…

00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:26.820
If they hadn't met me,

00:24:26.903 --> 00:24:30.782
they wouldn't have suffered so much.

00:24:30.865 --> 00:24:32.534
It's all your fault.

00:24:32.617 --> 00:24:34.703
-It's all my fault.
-Everything is your fault.

00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:36.913
Everything is my fault.

00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:39.082
If it hadn't been for you…

00:24:39.165 --> 00:24:40.458
If it hadn't been for me…

00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:42.377
If it hadn't been for you…

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.757
-If it hadn't been for me…
-If it hadn't been for you…

00:24:48.633 --> 00:24:50.218
If it hadn't been for me…

00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:51.803
It's all your fault.

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:53.972
It's all your fault.

00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:56.099
-It's all your fault.
-Stop talking.

00:24:57.642 --> 00:25:00.103
Stop talking!

00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:13.116
Stop talking!

00:25:13.617 --> 00:25:16.161
Shut up!

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:04.584
Answer me!

00:26:04.668 --> 00:26:06.252
Why did you kill that child?

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:12.217
I don't know why I killed him either.

00:26:15.011 --> 00:26:16.096
Maybe…

00:26:18.515 --> 00:26:20.600
I'm just a jerk.

00:26:24.187 --> 00:26:25.980
Perhaps I shouldn't have lived

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:28.900
in the first place.

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:32.153
Serial murders in the past few months
have caused widespread fear.

00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:34.280
The murderer is finally caught.

00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:37.742
Li Jen-yao, dubbed "The Rainstorm Killer"
by the media, is only 25 years old.

00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:41.955
He turned himself in to the police
after killing his father yesterday

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:44.958
and confessed to multiple murders.

00:26:45.041 --> 00:26:47.001
Li Jen-yao,
who committed multiple murders,

00:26:47.085 --> 00:26:48.545
was sentenced to death in 2017.

00:26:48.628 --> 00:26:50.588
Now, six years later,
he still awaits execution.

00:26:50.672 --> 00:26:52.716
Attorneys are reportedly exploring

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:54.968
a constitutional review for Li Jen-yao,

00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:57.429
but Li Jen-yao has yet to sign
an engagement letter

00:26:57.512 --> 00:26:59.764
and has refused to file
an extraordinary appeal.

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:27.292
Pin-yu?

00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:31.504
I remember when I first met you…

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.799
you said we were family.

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:38.720
You said I had forgotten a lot
because of a car accident.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.098
None of this is true, is it?

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.438
Tien-ching never met you.

00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:50.857
But you knew so much about me.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.484
This can't be a coincidence.

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:54.611
Did Li Jen-yao plan it?

00:28:01.326 --> 00:28:03.036
Did everything

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:05.038
come back to you?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.332
Answer me first.

00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:10.502
When you stayed and took care of me,

00:28:11.377 --> 00:28:13.004
did you already know

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:18.218
that Li Jen-yao was going to kill
everyone who hurt Hsiao-tung?

00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:26.351
Why didn't you stop him?

00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:28.478
Why did you let him do it?

00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:31.064
Why should I have stopped him?

00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:33.066
If he hadn't done it,

00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:36.152
I would've done it myself
and killed him too!

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.866
Because if it hadn't been for him,

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.286
this wouldn't have happened to you.

00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:49.833
He was with you back then.

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:53.127
But he failed to protect you
and even let this happen.

00:29:01.052 --> 00:29:03.304
Yet, in fact,
I know better than anyone else

00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:06.724
that deep down, the person I hate the most

00:29:07.684 --> 00:29:09.394
is myself.

00:29:10.937 --> 00:29:13.064
Back then, I really wanted to contact you.

00:29:13.565 --> 00:29:15.108
I really wanted to know

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:18.027
how you were doing
after I moved to Taipei.

00:29:20.238 --> 00:29:22.448
But I was afraid to hear

00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:26.995
that you were doing well without me.

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:29.998
I was afraid you would realize

00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:33.334
that I had been missing you,

00:29:34.127 --> 00:29:35.795
that I wished we could go back to

00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:38.506
when we were together all the time.

00:29:39.674 --> 00:29:41.384
But I was afraid to say it.

00:29:42.427 --> 00:29:43.845
HSIAO-TUNG CALLING

00:29:47.181 --> 00:29:48.975
Hello? Hsiao-tung.

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:51.060
How come you're calling out of the blue?

00:29:51.144 --> 00:29:54.397
You seriously said that?
What's been keeping you so busy?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.190
Why haven't you called me?

00:29:58.651 --> 00:29:59.736
Sorry.

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:02.405
I've had a lot of homework lately.

00:30:02.488 --> 00:30:04.657
I'm also taking
tutoring classes after school.

00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:07.285
And on weekends,
I have to help out at my mom's store.

00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:09.579
Why did you leave without waiting for us?

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.332
Sorry, I forgot.

00:30:12.832 --> 00:30:15.209
-I'm talking to a friend. One moment.
-Okay.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.420
-Hey, Hsiao-tung. So…
-Hey, Yun-chen.

00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:18.922
It's okay.

00:30:19.422 --> 00:30:20.965
I'll let you get back to your friends.

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:23.009
My dance practice is starting.

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:24.636
We'll talk soon.

00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:27.639
I'm going to hang up now. Bye.

00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:28.765
Hey, then--

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:44.030
That's why

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:48.868
I pretended that I was doing well
on my own in Taipei,

00:30:50.286 --> 00:30:52.914
that I was living
a great and fulfilling life…

00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:56.918
that I'd gotten used to

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.295
life without you by my side.

00:31:02.548 --> 00:31:04.676
Yet I didn't know

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.762
that was when it all happened.

00:31:09.722 --> 00:31:12.183
I didn't know I wasn't there for you

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:14.852
when you needed me the most.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.982
I didn't know anything.

00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:21.776
I didn't know any of it.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:24.696
How could I not have known any of it?

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.447
How could I…

00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.784
how could I have let you
go through that alone?

00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:47.593
I'm sorry.

00:31:51.222 --> 00:31:52.473
I'm sorry.

00:31:55.476 --> 00:31:57.020
Hsiao-tung, I'm sorry.

00:32:00.565 --> 00:32:02.567
I'm so sorry.

00:32:12.577 --> 00:32:16.456
Have you ever regretted
the crimes you committed?

00:32:17.957 --> 00:32:19.292
I don't regret them.

00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:24.380
Will you not regret them
even if you're executed in the end?

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.300
This is what I deserve.

00:32:29.302 --> 00:32:30.928
No matter what my punishment is…

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:34.807
I accept it.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.161
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

00:33:37.245 --> 00:33:39.163
If every person Li Jen-yao killed

00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:41.374
was connected to that video,

00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:43.292
that means his motive for murder

00:33:43.793 --> 00:33:46.003
was to get revenge for Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:33:47.213 --> 00:33:49.006
Rather than revenge,

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.425
I think

00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:54.470
Li Jen-yao was trying
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:33:54.554 --> 00:33:56.097
To protect Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.140
Yes.

00:33:57.223 --> 00:34:00.643
I think he did what he did
to protect Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:34:00.726 --> 00:34:03.146
He didn't want other people to know

00:34:03.646 --> 00:34:06.440
that those things
happened to Chiang Hsiao-tung,

00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:09.527
nor did he want anything
to trigger her memory.

00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:11.154
Hold on, Yu.

00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:12.989
Can you first tell us

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.825
where you learned about these things?

00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:18.119
Like the relationship between Jen-yao
and Hsiao-tung,

00:34:18.202 --> 00:34:20.538
and the people who hurt her.

00:34:22.582 --> 00:34:23.791
How do I even start?

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:25.418
Yu,

00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:27.545
have you found Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:34:29.422 --> 00:34:30.339
What?

00:34:30.423 --> 00:34:31.883
Isn't she already dead?

00:34:31.966 --> 00:34:34.594
Didn't you two find out
about Chiang Hsiao-tung

00:34:34.677 --> 00:34:36.637
because Yu was possessed by a ghost?

00:34:36.721 --> 00:34:38.431
No, listen.

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:40.850
If you follow Yu's train of thought,

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:43.644
everything Li Jen-yao did

00:34:44.437 --> 00:34:47.064
was not only to avenge Chiang Hsiao-tung

00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:49.859
but also to protect her,

00:34:49.942 --> 00:34:52.111
so she wouldn't remember
those things, right?

00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:53.070
What does it mean?

00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:56.782
Chiang Hsiao-tung isn't dead!

00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:02.538
Is she still alive somewhere?

00:35:10.963 --> 00:35:12.173
Wait.

00:35:14.592 --> 00:35:15.551
If

00:35:16.052 --> 00:35:19.472
Li Jen-yao had risked so much
to hide Chiang Hsiao-tung,

00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:21.599
he would never tell you all this.

00:35:24.227 --> 00:35:25.228
Hsu Ta-wei.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.318
Hey, besides, I've watched that video.

00:35:33.236 --> 00:35:35.238
No one else's face was shown,

00:35:35.863 --> 00:35:37.573
except Chiang Hsiao-tung's.

00:35:38.074 --> 00:35:38.908
What does it mean?

00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:41.911
She was the only one
who could have told you about it.

00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:48.417
Yu.

00:35:50.294 --> 00:35:51.462
You two have met, right?

00:35:55.716 --> 00:35:56.717
Yes.

00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:59.095
Everything you just said is correct.

00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.972
Chiang Hsiao-tung

00:36:02.348 --> 00:36:03.599
told me all this.

00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:05.101
Hey, then,

00:36:05.977 --> 00:36:07.770
can you arrange for us to meet?

00:36:09.188 --> 00:36:11.190
Strictly speaking,

00:36:11.274 --> 00:36:14.610
I'm trying to figure out
a way for you guys to meet.

00:36:32.253 --> 00:36:33.462
What's on your mind?

00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:41.470
Do you think

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:43.806
what Yu said earlier

00:36:44.307 --> 00:36:45.141
is true?

00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:53.065
Hey.

00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:55.860
Do you remember

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.446
when we first made it
into the Taipei Film Festival?

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:02.116
How could I possibly forget?

00:37:03.326 --> 00:37:05.703
We were supposed to receive
our award that day.

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:08.331
But we ended up at the police station.

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:10.082
What was the honk for?

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:12.293
What was that? Get out of the car.

00:37:12.877 --> 00:37:15.296
Get out! Why are you being
a coward now? Get out!

00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:17.381
Hsu Ta-wei, you're not getting out.

00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:19.383
I'll call the cops. Let them handle it.

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:20.301
Honking nonstop!

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.471
You kept honking.
What the hell was that for? Get out!

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:25.639
-Hsu Ta-wei! You--
-Get out!

00:37:25.723 --> 00:37:26.932
Get out.

00:37:27.016 --> 00:37:28.434
Don't think I won't hit you.

00:37:35.524 --> 00:37:36.525
Stop!

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:38.069
Stop!

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:39.904
Hsu Ta-wei!

00:37:39.987 --> 00:37:42.198
Hsu Ta-wei, what are you doing?
Hsu Ta-wei!

00:37:43.574 --> 00:37:44.408
Hsu Ta-wei!

00:37:44.992 --> 00:37:46.619
Hsu Ta-wei!

00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:57.963
I lied to you.

00:37:58.839 --> 00:38:00.007
What do you mean?

00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:01.342
I don't get it.

00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:11.143
He dropped the charges against me

00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:15.314
because after we got
to the police station,

00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:16.774
he recognized who I was.

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:19.568
You knew each other?

00:38:25.408 --> 00:38:26.909
I left the car and beat him up,

00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:30.162
not because he blocked us in,

00:38:30.746 --> 00:38:32.081
but because he was…

00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:39.880
the one who raped my sister…

00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:43.926
and drove her to suicide.

00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:51.725
I could never forget

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:54.895
that, in court,

00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:57.189
he knelt on the floor

00:38:57.982 --> 00:38:59.400
and said tearfully,

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:02.153
"Please forgive me."

00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:05.781
"I know I made a mistake."

00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:08.993
"I will turn over a new leaf."

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:19.336
I could never forget
the way my sister died.

00:39:20.129 --> 00:39:22.339
None of us said we would forgive him.

00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:26.635
But the court

00:39:27.845 --> 00:39:30.055
was swayed by his damn crocodile tears.

00:39:31.974 --> 00:39:33.851
They believed he was truly remorseful

00:39:34.768 --> 00:39:36.479
and still had a conscience.

00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:40.733
Not to mention he was a minor.

00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:43.402
Fuck.

00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:46.906
He… only did a few years and was released.

00:39:59.168 --> 00:40:00.461
Since the day

00:40:02.129 --> 00:40:04.006
I left the courthouse,

00:40:04.924 --> 00:40:06.133
you know,

00:40:06.884 --> 00:40:09.011
I have been so angry.

00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:11.680
I'm still furious.

00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:17.353
That's why I wanted to film Li Jen-yao.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.357
Why film that murderer?

00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:31.700
I was thinking that if it was
because I couldn't release my rage,

00:40:32.743 --> 00:40:34.954
then maybe I could use my documentary

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:37.915
to let others see

00:40:38.832 --> 00:40:41.919
and understand the hatred inside me.

00:40:52.763 --> 00:40:55.683
TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA VERSUS SIX

00:40:59.478 --> 00:41:02.231
TALENTED HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA VERSUS SIX

00:41:13.742 --> 00:41:17.663
But I could never have imagined
that the only person in the world…

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:24.753
who could understand my pain

00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:27.881
would actually be Li Jen-yao.

00:42:23.812 --> 00:42:26.774
Chiang Hsiao-tung, I know you can hear me.

00:42:49.922 --> 00:42:51.298
These past few days,

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.469
I've been watching Li Jen-yao's interview.

00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:01.225
I also secretly went to see your parents.

00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:11.235
I didn't know what was going on back then…

00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:15.280
so I didn't feel much.

00:43:16.615 --> 00:43:19.827
Now that I've experienced
everything you went through…

00:43:23.956 --> 00:43:25.457
seeing them

00:43:26.792 --> 00:43:28.460
made my heart ache.

00:43:34.299 --> 00:43:35.759
But I couldn't tell

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:38.637
if that was your pain or mine.

00:43:42.433 --> 00:43:43.600
Hsiao-tung.

00:43:44.768 --> 00:43:45.936
Let me ask you.

00:43:47.354 --> 00:43:49.440
Are you sure
you don't want to see Li Jen-yao?

00:43:52.359 --> 00:43:54.278
Because I know you do.

00:43:54.778 --> 00:43:59.533
That's why you took my computer then
and looked up what happened to Li Jen-yao.

00:43:59.616 --> 00:44:02.661
And after learning
that he was put on death row,

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:04.788
you wanted to see him one last time.

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:07.207
Were you crying?

00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:09.334
That wasn't me.

00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:10.753
It was her.

00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:13.630
LI JEN-YAO

00:44:14.423 --> 00:44:15.966
Why did she look up Li Jen-yao?

00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:18.093
What's their relationship?

00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:24.224
I don't know why you backed out later.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:28.187
But I know you want to see Li Jen-yao.

00:44:28.937 --> 00:44:31.899
That's why you told me
all about the two of you.

00:44:32.649 --> 00:44:35.527
You want me to protect him and help him

00:44:36.028 --> 00:44:37.029
on your behalf.

00:44:37.821 --> 00:44:39.281
But you should know

00:44:39.364 --> 00:44:42.701
that, although I am happy
to face anything for you,

00:44:43.285 --> 00:44:44.828
there's one thing

00:44:45.537 --> 00:44:46.955
I can never do for you.

00:44:47.664 --> 00:44:48.916
That is…

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.297
I'm not the person
Li Jen-yao wants to see.

00:45:15.192 --> 00:45:16.401
Just like you,

00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:18.737
all these years,

00:45:19.238 --> 00:45:21.114
the person Li Jen-yao wants to see most

00:45:22.282 --> 00:45:23.575
has always been you.

00:45:26.286 --> 00:45:28.455
No matter how you've changed,

00:45:29.915 --> 00:45:31.792
he still only wants to see you.

00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:37.811
TO LI JEN-YAO

00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:44.609
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

00:50:30.382 --> 00:50:31.758
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

PLANNER: CHOU PIN-YU

00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:38.992
It's about time. So…

00:51:41.995 --> 00:51:45.540
Will you… come again?

00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:49.127
I will come again.

00:52:19.741 --> 00:52:20.700
Dummy.

00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:23.536
I've missed you so much.

00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:28.124
Me too.
