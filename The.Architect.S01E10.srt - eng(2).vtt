Xi Yan.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.519
You are already my honored consort.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.359
(Why would I dream of such a thing?)

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.960
(The entire Shen clan died unjustly.)

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.210
(Not to mention Pei Yu has yet
to clear his name,)

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.679
(even if he were innocent,)

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.600
(if I let affection cloud my mind,)

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.280
(it would disgrace the ancestors
of the Shen family.)

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.479
(Shen Changning,)

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.640
(as long as you are alive,)

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.520
(you must never forget)

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.180
(the blood-deep hatred
of the Shen clan.)

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.240
(Even if you have only one breath left,)

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.520
(you must keep it to avenge
the Shen family's injustice.)

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.312
(Shen)

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:38.241
(Were the Shens killed for wealth?)

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.346
(Yet valuables were untouched.)

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.275
(Was Prince Duan's Residence involved?)

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.959
(Why is there no record
of the mysterious man in the case file?)

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.640
Greetings,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Your Highness.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.959
Your Highness.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.359
Insolent!

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.560
The Governor's study's

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.799
contents are state secrets.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.560
Even I cannot enter without permission.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.829
What are you to sit here so boldly?

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.919
Matron Li.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:14.479
Yes.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.479
Teach her properly

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.879
what rules are.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.400
Your Highness.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.520
She hit me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.639
- Your Highness cannot enter,
- Your Highness.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.120
doesn't mean I cannot enter.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.560
This is the Governor's Residence.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.560
It follows the Governor's rules.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.360
How dare you

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.759
lay a hand on my people?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.639
Seize her.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.400
Yes.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.240
Quickly.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.319
Matron Li,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.199
cut off her hand.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.280
Stay still.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.199
With no proof,

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.680
you punish me with private torture?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.560
You treat lives as nothing,

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.159
how are you fit to be mistress
of this residence?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.719
Do you deserve it?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.919
How dare you rebuke me?

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.919
Do you even know what you are?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.080
Why haven't you done it yet?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.890
- Greetings, Your Lordship.
- Greetings, Your Lordship.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.120
Miss.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.599
I did not know

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.380
the servants in my residence
had begun using your surname.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.039
Yu.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.520
I only

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.319
helped discipline

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.840
one of your concubines.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.759
Discipline a concubine?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.639
Your Highness has repeatedly

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.240
used private punishment in my residence.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.439
Do you take my rules for nothing?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.719
Yu.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.599
This lowly maid barged into your study.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.800
Should she not be punished?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.360
I already granted her permission

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.120
to enter freely.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.279
From today on,

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.759
you will move into my room.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.839
Stay by my side day and night,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.279
sleep and eat with me,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.759
go wherever I go,

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.920
so others will not misunderstand again.

(My vital point lies here.)

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600
You seem interested in my study.

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.079
This is not my first time here.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.199
The Princess made a fuss over nothing.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.959
If you want something,

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.680
you can simply ask.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.800
I may not refuse.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.319
You

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.560
aren't punishing me for trespassing?

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.360
you may serve me closely from now on.

you may go.

at least I used this chance)
