00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.750
[Episode 8]

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.400
Let's talk about it later.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.100
Come back.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.610
You're the girl
from the boxing gym that day, right?

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.770
So what if I was?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.579
How did you hook up with Jin Zhao?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.060
Have you two slept together?

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.690
Don't talk nonsense.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.650
He and I aren't like that.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.700
And who are you?

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.170
Guess.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.530
Snakey?

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.810
Are you crazy?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.220
What snake? That's a dragon on my waist!

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.790
So you're Dragon then.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.860
I just realized

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.680
you're kinda cute,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.210
like a little bunny.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.680
I'm Wan Qing.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.420
And you?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.930
Jiang Mu.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.740
Jiang Mu.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.050
Jiang.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.700
Tell me,

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.240
what's really going on
between Jin Zhao and you?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.370
Be honest.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.050
Tell me!

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.240
What are you doing?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.880
Don't scare her.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.490
I'm just joking with her.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.750
Right?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.700
Why so fierce?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.650
If you think I'm fierce, get lost.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.980
No way.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.370
I just like you this way.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.260
Besides,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.210
I've only been gone for a few days,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.530
and you've already hooked up
with someone new.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.810
That's so heartless.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.740
Come on,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.320
let's go get some pork trotters.
Ignore him.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.020
Crazy, Crazy! Hurry!

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.410
Clear some space, clear some space!

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.940
Hot dish coming through!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.580
Jiang Mu,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.500
guess what's in here?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.470
You really made chicken soup?

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.790
Brandy bought the chicken this morning,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.180
and I just stewed it for you.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.950
I didn't lie to you, right?

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.870
Thank you.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.159
Brandy,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.270
come sit with me and have a drink.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.560
These pork trotters are delicious.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.090
Pass them around. Try some.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.470
Quick, give me some.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.200
Here you go.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.950
Cheers.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.610
You don't know how to eat trotters?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.900
Eat.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.970
I'll eat it later.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.590
What?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.409
I stewed this chicken for two hours,

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.940
and you want the first bite?

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.870
What do you even need nourishment for?
Are you crazy?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.200
Come on, come on.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.100
My bad, my bad.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.660
Sis.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.470
Please try some.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.510
Thank you.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.640
How is it?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.530
Very delicious.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.620
You glutton, really.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.850
Who's this girl with?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.700
Brandy's sister.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.680
Isn't Brandy's sister

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.640
still in elementary school?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.620
Where did this beautiful little girl

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.820
come from?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.530
Blood-related siblings?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.060
Well, why are you looking at me?

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.470
I'm talking to you! Can't you hear?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.780
Blood-related.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.030
His blood-related sister.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.260
She's really his blood-related sister.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.850
Um...

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.460
I swear on my old man,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.490
they're siblings by blood,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.090
and their bond is stronger
than anyone else's.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.970
I heard Guang and his men came here

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.280
and caused trouble.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.680
What were they thinking?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.330
I called Xiang to the back

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.600
and taught him a lesson.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.970
I did pretty well, huh?

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.730
No need.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.970
What do you mean, "no need"?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.770
Unnecessary.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.290
Crazy Jin works for Wan's Garage?

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.460
I was just looking out for our buddy.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.890
Are you eating that trotter?
If not, give it to me.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.820
I have more here.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.290
Stop that.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.440
Your hands are all greasy.
Let me wipe them for you.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.910
I can do it myself.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.710
Brandy, are you crazy?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.490
Take your time eating, sister.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.370
Be careful not to choke.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.190
Hurry up and eat.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.090
After eating,
go back to Jin Qiang's place.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.290
I haven't finished my homework yet.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.220
I'll go back to my room to finish it.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160
Come on, Jiang Mu.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.880
Here's a big coconut for you.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.810
Thank you, Sanlai.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.730
Sanlai.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.990
Where's Jin Zhao?

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.530
He's outside.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.570
Is Wan Qing his girlfriend?

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.290
Brandy wouldn't be with her.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.740
Why?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.860
She's the daughter

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.700
of Wan's Garage's owner.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.230
The daughter of Wan's Garage's owner...

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.640
So,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.950
not going home again tonight?

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.380
Of course not.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.930
I haven't finished my homework yet.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.570
I'll go home after I finish it here.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.450
Besides, the AC at home is still broken.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.450
It's boiling hot.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.600
Your AC is broken.
Then you really shouldn't go back.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.930
It must be insanely hot.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.560
I never said I wasn't going home.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.550
Really?

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.580
Alright, I'm not teasing you anymore.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.710
I'll leave you to it.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.990
As I said before,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.410
if you need money, just tell me.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.950
Please don't get yourself into that mess.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.260
You're wading

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.650
into deep waters.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.020
Just listen to me on this.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.380
I'd never harm you.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
My business is none of your concern.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.060
Have I ever bothered with
other people's business?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.320
You're unbelievable.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.660
Jin Zhao, don't push me too far.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.930
And if I do?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.170
Let me put it this way:

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.690
you can't get that part you want

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.050
anywhere in Manshi.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.200
My father had people buy them all.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.940
Just give in a little,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.500
and I'll help you get one.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.360
How about that?

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.360
I don't need your help.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.360
I can handle it myself.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.050
Leave.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.290
Stop coming here all the time.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.140
Suit yourself.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.970
As if I wanted to come here.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.710
What are you doing?

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.900
Cleaning the car.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.470
Stay away from here.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.410
Why?

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.360
Can't you see there's stuff everywhere?

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.030
What could you do here anyway?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580
Why is she allowed to come here then?

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.670
Are you...

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.850
throwing a tantrum?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.260
What tantrum?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.480
I'm not throwing any tantrum.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.880
I have a very good temper.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.370
I'm just seeking fairness and justice.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.740
Yes,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.500
you have a great temper.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.100
You're not as even-tempered
as you used to be too!

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.230
Look who's talking.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.880
Crazy works for Mr. Wan.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.530
He heard about those guys

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.620
who came here the other day
to cause trouble.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.820
He gave Xiang a good beating afterward.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.710
But Jin Zhao changed the subject,

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.380
probably because Wan Qing was there.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.400
There's a conflict
between Jin Zhao and Mr. Wan,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.480
and Snakey is Mr. Wan's daughter.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.020
However, her stance is unclear.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.440
She seems to care about Jin Zhao a lot.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.810
She...

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.350
She has feelings for Jin Zhao.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.340
But Jin Zhao probably
isn't interested in her.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.690
Otherwise,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.390
he wouldn't have interrupted her
like that.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.530
Look at this place.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
So much stuff.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.220
It's dirty and messy.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.010
I almost put it in the washing machine

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.500
with his work clothes.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.380
It looks brand new.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:56.380
Of course.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.490
Brandy... washed it

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.170
by hand.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:27:59.410
I saw it that day.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.630
No wonder.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.300
That day I saw this uniform

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.010
hanging by the door,

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.340
and I wanted to try it on.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.010
But your master really chewed me out,

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.650
saying my hands were covered in
dog and cat hair,

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.100
and wouldn't let me touch it.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.380
So he was saving it for someone.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.300
Thank you, Zhao.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920
I can do it myself.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.540
But Jiang Mu,

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.840
you must treasure this uniform.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.790
Brandy never had the chance to wear it.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.790
There's only one uniform like this.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.900
Here, eat more.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.800
Talk less.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.490
Don't worry, I'll definitely treasure it.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.580
Thank you, Brandy.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.070
Thanks again, Brandy.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.110
Just eat your food.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.650
Right on time.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.030
Mu, you're here.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.590
We can get started now.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.650
You got a uniform?

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.140
Who did you borrow

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.850
this uniform from?

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.460
Jin Zhao. What's wrong?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.650
Your brother was a top student?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.200
Yes, I told you when we first met.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.210
I mean,

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.150
he was a top student at our school?

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.580
When I was in 11th grade,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.820
I heard that at our school,

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.970
winners of city-level competitions
and above

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.490
receive not only certificates
and scholarships

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.450
but also a special uniform.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.490
The uniform looks
just like our regular one,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.970
with no obvious difference.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.450
The only difference is

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.880
that around the school badge,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.600
there's a gold star.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.880
As far as I know,

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.970
only one student has received
the gold star uniform in recent years.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.660
Our homeroom teacher, Mr. Ma,
once mentioned

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.840
that the owner of this gold star uniform

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.170
was his prized student.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.600
Looks like that person

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.820
is your brother, Jin Zhao!

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.370
No wonder

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.290
Jin Zhao wouldn't let Sanlai try it on

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.420
when he asked.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.450
Turns out it's limited edition.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.380
Nana,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.960
since you know the story
of the school badge,

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.010
do you know

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.140
why Jin Zhao suddenly gave up his studies?

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.000
What exactly happened back then?

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.690
I don't know.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.300
No one ever talked about it.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.820
I have some problems I can't solve.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.350
Could you help me with them?

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.110
Sit down, and let's go through them.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.490
What competition

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.650
did you win to get this uniform?

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.840
City-wide physics competition trials.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.660
So you were selected?

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.660
What happened then?

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.520
Then nothing.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.400
Then...

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.010
Back then...

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.240
why didn't you take
the college entrance exam?

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.010
I've made notes

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.390
on all these problems for you.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.410
Take a look.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.350
Ask me if you don't understand.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.700
Jiang Mu!

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.900
-Sanlai.
-Stop studying.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.500
You're gonna fry your brain.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:45.870
Chocolate flavor.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.510
How did you know I like chocolate flavor?

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.620
Brandy told me.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.880
Forget about him.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.480
I'll take you somewhere fun.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.070
Where?

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.120
Let's go.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.760
I'll show you a magic trick later.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.540
Linda!

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.010
She's so adorable.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.860
Linda, why are you being so good today?

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:12.970
Come on, come on!

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960
Come on, twirl!

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.070
Go play.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.340
How did you do that?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.340
It's so adorable!

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.880
Linda has been with me for years.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.040
No wonder you're so close.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:30.720
Jiang Mu.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.540
Are these her puppies?

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.160
Yes,

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.530
Xishi just gave birth to these puppies.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.380
Xishi.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.060
Congratulations, Xishi.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120
What about that one?

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.860
Why isn't its mom taking care of it?

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.730
Goldie was barely breathing
when he was born,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.210
so Xishi abandoned him at the door.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.470
I went and rescued him.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.980
Poor puppy.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.800
-Come on, Goldie!
-Poor baby.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.910
Come on.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.080
Take a look at him.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:13.120
Little one.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.860
Hello there.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.739
I'll get him something to drink.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.920
You're lying down.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.679
He lay down.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.389
He seems to really like you.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.060
Here, you feed him.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.860
Time for some water.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:36.860
Just a little bit.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.489
Slow down, slow down.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.340
When I was little, I met

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.650
a little yellow dog in my neighborhood.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:52.969
It followed me all the way home.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:54.830
But my mom wouldn't let me keep it.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.870
You can't have a dog!

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.990
Get rid of it.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.780
Zhao, what should we do about the puppy?

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.100
It needs a home.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:12.610
How about...

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:15.930
we hide it?

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.490
That works.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.820
Let's go.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.540
Okay.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:50.900
-Puppy.
-Puppy.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.930
Little puppy.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.560
Little puppy. Woof, woof.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.800
Where's the puppy?

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.690
Zhao, where's the puppy?

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:09.750
I don't know.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.130
Did it get lost?

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.700
Could it be in danger?

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.860
It won't be in danger.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.740
Don't worry.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.000
There it is. Let's go.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.810
Come with me.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.300
Later, Jin Zhao and I

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.340
gave that puppy a name.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.780
We called it Lightning.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:28.380
I never saw it again after that.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.740
Would you like to keep him?

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.870
I can give him to you.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.570
Forget it.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.810
I don't have a place to keep him now.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.130
You're thirsty again.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.500
Let's go!

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.520
Coming!

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.720
Puppy, I have to leave now.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.490
I'll come see you next time.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.160
If you want to keep him,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.270
there's a place.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.400
Go ask Brandy.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.470
Would that work?

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.970
You've been staring at me this whole time.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.230
What do you want to say?

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.410
I just saw the golden retriever's

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.340
puppy at Sanlai's store.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.870
It's so adorable.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.090
Sanlai said

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.260
that the puppy was abandoned

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.780
by its mom the moment it was born.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.140
He saved its life.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.740
And it seems...

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.590
Xishi doesn't like it very much either.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.610
Don't you think that's sad?

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.200
He just makes up a story,

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.940
and you get all emotional about it.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.930
Why don't you ask Sanlai

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.010
how he saved it?

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.880
You want to keep it?

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.460
Out of his four puppies,

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.360
two pretty good ones

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.120
have already been reserved.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.950
He's giving you one of the two
that won't sell,

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.200
so you can ask me to keep it at my place.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.470
That way, you'll cover the dog food

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.090
and grooming costs for him.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:10.470
Are you stupid?

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.700
If I pay for all the dog food

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.220
and grooming

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.590
and keep it at your place temporarily,

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.120
would that be okay with you?

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.460
And what about later?

When you have to leave in the future,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.180
would you take it with you

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.240

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.400
Since you're going to leave anyway,
