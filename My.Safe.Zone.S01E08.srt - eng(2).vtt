00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:04.624
Being proposed to
is kind of nerve-wracking, right?

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:07.305
If you can't let go,
then let's stop seeing each other.

00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:09.025
It just makes things harder.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:10.665
Why keep trying?

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.665
I don't want to regret
not doing everything I could.

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.185
I told her already.

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:16.865
Someone's already claimed me.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:18.905
I can't love anyone else now.

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:33.425
I'll bring it to your house
when I'm done writing it.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.425
I packed everything for you.

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.905
Go take a shower and get ready,
or you'll miss your flight.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.905
I don't want to go, Mom.

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:01.945
I know your life is here.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:07.905
But if you go, it could be even better.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:10.545
There'll be more opportunities.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.545
You should go.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.625
You earned that scholarship.
It wasn't easy.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.825
And have you told Jane yet?

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:34.825
If you've thought it through,

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.425
I'll respect your decision.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:15.905
THE WAIT

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:34.265
Wow. Done. It smells nice.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:37.825
Have you seen Lin?

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.385
She walked home early this morning.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:42.105
She didn't wake me up.

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.985
-What's that?
-What?

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:53.785
On your finger, what is that?

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.585
What is it?

00:03:58.785 --> 00:03:59.625
Lin gave it to me.

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:06.465
Congratulations, dear.

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:14.665
You finally got your wish.

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:19.624
I'm going to marry Lin.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.385
Whatever makes you happy, dear.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:26.705
I've seen you wait for her for so long.

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:28.345
You never even looked at anyone else.

00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.185
Lin was my first love,

00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:35.025
and she'll be my last.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.305
Give me a hug, I'm so happy.

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:01.065
I miss you.

00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:05.865
Let's go pick out rings today.

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:13.705
This daisy will wilt soon.

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:22.865
But before we go,

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.425
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

00:05:33.505 --> 00:05:34.505
Aom,

00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:37.505
I brought your favorite snacks.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:40.545
Thank you.

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:42.505
Has your daughter told you anything yet?

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:44.665
Not yet.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:47.665
We're really going to be a family soon.

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:50.065
If it's Jane, I'd be happy.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:53.465
That's great!

00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:56.705
But I do worry a bit.

00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:01.305
My family's not rich.
We still have to work to get by.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.625
Money isn't the issue.

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:10.145
Hey,

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:14.625
I liked Kate
because I thought she loved Lin,

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:16.385
and if things got tough,

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:18.225
they would take care of each other.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:21.785
But if it's Jane,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:24.945
she's better than anyone in this world.

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:31.585
In the end,
it's about whether they love each other.

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.985
One day, we won't be around anymore.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:40.225
And when that day comes,
they'll have to take care of each other.

00:06:43.345 --> 00:06:45.065
You're so sweet.

00:06:54.785 --> 00:06:58.665
They reached out. If I say yes,
they want me to start right away.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.465
When would you go?

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:06.105
I haven't decided yet.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.185
I wanted to talk to you first.

00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:21.705
I'm going home.

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:25.025
Jane…

00:07:31.665 --> 00:07:32.945
They're really getting married?

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:34.185
Are you serious?

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:36.145
Yes. My girl told me herself.

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:38.945
Jane, what do you think--

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:41.745
Hey? Wait.

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:43.945
Jane! I'll be back. Jane!

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:44.825
What happened?

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:46.865
What's wrong, Jane?

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:50.705
Jane, wait for me.

00:07:58.905 --> 00:08:00.065
Jane.

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:02.985
Why are you crying?

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:21.785
A fashion magazine in New York
reached out to Lin.

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.665
Is she going?

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.825
She asked me.

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:37.985
And what did you say?

00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:46.865
I don't want her to go.

00:08:54.945 --> 00:08:56.505
But it's the job she loves.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.905
It's a big opportunity for her.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.225
What if I let her go,

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:17.265
and she disappears again?

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:57.785
Did Jane change her number?

00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:58.705
Yes.

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:02.105
Then may I have her new number?

00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:05.025
Jane's not doing well right now.

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:07.905
She cries all the time.

00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:11.065
She won't eat, won't sleep.
She's lost so much weight.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.345
She won't leave the house
or talk to anyone.

00:10:14.065 --> 00:10:15.185
I feel so bad for her.

00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:19.785
If you're not coming back to Thailand,

00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:22.785
I think it's better
you don't contact her anymore.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:28.105
I understand.

00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:31.105
I won't contact her again.

00:10:42.505 --> 00:10:44.305
I told Lin to stop contacting you

00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:47.225
if she wasn't ever coming back.

00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:51.825
You kept crying,

00:10:53.065 --> 00:10:54.665
couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.

00:10:57.345 --> 00:10:59.985
Every time you woke up,
you cried yourself back to sleep.

00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:05.385
I couldn't bear to see someone I love

00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:11.745
in that much pain.

00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:14.025
I couldn't.

00:11:19.305 --> 00:11:21.105
I felt bad for you.

00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:25.785
So I decided

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:28.065
it was better if you two stopped talking.

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:32.345
I'm sorry.

00:12:16.665 --> 00:12:17.985
Jane already left, didn't she?

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:23.225
Yes.

00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:29.545
I got a job offer from New York.

00:12:32.865 --> 00:12:35.785
So what are you going to do?

00:12:39.345 --> 00:12:42.945
Ever since I came back,
I had been waiting for that email.

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:46.865
I checked my phone morning, noon,
and night, waiting for it.

00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:52.505
But one day, I forgot about it.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.145
Because I was happy to be here with you,

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.105
to be at home,

00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:02.505
and to be with Jane.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:11.185
So you've already
made your decision, haven't you?

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:20.185
I'VE GOT A JOB AS A PHOTOGRAPHER ASSISTANT

00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:27.585
THIS IS THE FIRST MAGAZINE I'VE SHOT.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER NOW.

00:13:46.585 --> 00:13:48.225
DEAR JANE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
BE HAPPY…

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:53.105
Every year on your birthday,
Lin sent a card.

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:56.585
I had to put them away each time.

00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:59.865
Actually, the one who stopped talking
these past eight years

00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:02.065
was me, not Lin.

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.065
I think she's always been consistent.

00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:10.225
It was me. I was scared
she wouldn't come back.

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:11.985
Scared she'd hurt you again.

00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:16.585
But now, I think
even if she goes to New York,

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:19.345
or anywhere in the world,

00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:22.465
I believe she'll still be true to you.

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:35.945
No need.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:37.665
Thank you.

00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:49.985
Jane's waiting inside.

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:54.945
Lin.

00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:56.745
Yes?

00:14:57.345 --> 00:15:01.105
I just found out you never told Jane
that I asked you

00:15:01.185 --> 00:15:02.785
to stop contacting her.

00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:11.465
Thank you for that.

00:15:15.545 --> 00:15:17.105
Go. She's waiting.

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:29.065
Let's not disturb them.

00:15:52.665 --> 00:15:54.705
Thank you for never forgetting me.

00:15:57.225 --> 00:15:58.545
How could I?

00:16:00.465 --> 00:16:02.505
You've always meant the world to me.

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:08.465
When we were friends,

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:11.425
you were the closest person in my life.

00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:14.425
I could spend the whole day with you

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:16.465
without saying a word.

00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:19.505
Just having you beside me

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:22.865
made me happy.

00:16:25.545 --> 00:16:28.425
I didn't know if I liked being around you

00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:31.105
because of comfort,

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:33.185
closeness,

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:35.785
or because…

00:16:39.505 --> 00:16:41.745
I'd already been
in love with you all along.

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:46.785
I've never loved anyone but you.

00:16:49.705 --> 00:16:53.705
And I keep falling in love with you
over and over again.

00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:15.265
These are my letters.

00:17:15.345 --> 00:17:16.345
‎DEAR JANE, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
‎I HOPE YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY THIS YEAR…

00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:29.505
Aunt Tuk kept them all.

00:17:32.825 --> 00:17:33.905
Every single one?

00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:44.425
About the New York job,

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:49.265
I'm okay if you take it.

00:17:58.065 --> 00:18:00.905
I know you wouldn't leave me.

00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:07.625
How could I stay away from you?

00:18:10.345 --> 00:18:11.825
My little ball of joy.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.625
Is she still on leave today?

00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:24.625
If she doesn't show up, I guess she's off.

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:25.545
Yeah.

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.425
Weird, right?

00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:29.825
She used to be
at the restaurant every day.

00:18:29.905 --> 00:18:31.265
Now she's like,

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:34.625
I am

00:18:34.705 --> 00:18:37.825
the CEO

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:43.025
The CEO…

00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:47.025
‎Sorry, Tim…

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:50.145
-Tim…
-Where's Jane?

00:18:51.985 --> 00:18:53.625
She hasn't come in yet.

00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:55.905
Do you have any business with her?

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:59.145
No. I just arranged to meet someone here.

00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:03.385
-You should get back to work.
-Sure.

00:19:03.465 --> 00:19:05.465
Let's go then. Time to prep the fish.

00:19:05.545 --> 00:19:08.785
The fish…

00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.385
-Come here.
-Let's go.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.785
Who's he meeting with?

00:19:15.385 --> 00:19:17.545
I don't know. But not me.

00:19:18.945 --> 00:19:21.385
Of course not. If it were,

00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:23.145
it would be to fire you.

00:19:26.105 --> 00:19:27.225
Don't you wanna know?

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:29.905
Nope.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.625
Boss's business.

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:47.505
Who's that?

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:51.225
Oh, now you're curious?

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:54.225
I'm just looking out for Jane, okay?

00:19:55.545 --> 00:19:56.905
Sure.

00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.385
I think this is the end.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.225
But I want to see Lin.

00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:03.105
Why would you?

00:20:03.185 --> 00:20:06.225
I thought we got our answer at the resort.

00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:10.225
Lin's not picking up my calls.

00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:15.145
So, she's Lin's ex?

00:20:18.105 --> 00:20:19.185
This isn't good.

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:22.385
If you know where she is,

00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:25.145
could you take me to her?

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:46.465
Thank you, Lin, for once loving me.

00:20:49.705 --> 00:20:52.825
That was the best time of my life.

00:21:00.265 --> 00:21:02.265
At first, I came back
hoping to win you back.

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:05.465
I really wanted to do everything I could

00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:08.625
to get you back.

00:21:15.145 --> 00:21:17.625
But when I saw the way you looked at Jane…

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:20.385
I understood everything.

00:21:24.705 --> 00:21:27.025
There's no way you'll ever look
at anyone else again.

00:21:33.665 --> 00:21:36.305
Well, I'm gonna head to the restaurant.

00:21:47.145 --> 00:21:49.225
Can we still be friends?

00:21:54.785 --> 00:21:57.185
Why isn't she here yet?

00:21:57.265 --> 00:21:58.665
I don't know.

00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:04.385
Oh, there she is. Jane!

00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:05.305
Jane!

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:07.385
What's up?

00:22:07.985 --> 00:22:12.385
Well, Tim brought
a girl here to talk today.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:15.385
Yeah, they were talking
about going to a resort with her.

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:18.265
It looks like

00:22:18.345 --> 00:22:20.865
the girl was--

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:22.385
What?

00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:24.345
Whoa.

00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:26.945
Well, it looks like the girl--

00:22:27.505 --> 00:22:28.585
What's wrong?

00:22:28.665 --> 00:22:30.185
Are you sick?

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:32.225
If you've caught a cold, go rest.

00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:36.785
It looks like the girl was Lin's ex.

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:42.225
What?

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:49.385
We're so getting fired.

00:22:52.105 --> 00:22:54.185
But the kitchen's so busy, right?

00:22:54.265 --> 00:22:55.225
Yeah, seriously.

00:22:55.305 --> 00:22:58.705
So busy that without us,
Jane would be overwhelmed.

00:22:58.785 --> 00:22:59.865
Yeah, she'd be overworked.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.865
We can't get fired. We need to work hard.

00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:03.305
Show max effort.

00:23:03.385 --> 00:23:05.825
This restaurant
can't survive without us, Tim.

00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:07.625
Whoa, so scary…

00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:18.785
You brought Kate here, didn't you?

00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:25.825
And you're the one
who took her to the resort.

00:23:32.025 --> 00:23:33.865
It's been a long time, Tim.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:37.385
I've always been clear that whatever
this is between us isn't possible,

00:23:39.225 --> 00:23:42.705
not because you're not good enough,
but because I already love someone,

00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:45.425
and I've loved her for a long time.

00:23:46.745 --> 00:23:48.745
So you're telling me to give up?

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:50.745
You don't have to give up

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:53.625
because you were never Lin's competition.

00:23:54.945 --> 00:23:57.025
I've always loved Lin.

00:23:58.385 --> 00:24:00.265
No one could ever replace her.

00:24:00.785 --> 00:24:03.385
And I could never love anyone else
the way I love her.

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:14.105
-Jane.
-Hmm?

00:24:17.785 --> 00:24:19.265
I wanted to talk about Pie.

00:24:20.585 --> 00:24:23.745
The police found a money trail from her
to the person who threw the rock.

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:28.425
This morning, she confessed
because of the evidence.

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:31.505
She also admitted that

00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:34.705
the car that grazed Lin
during the photoshoot

00:24:35.665 --> 00:24:37.465
was meant to hit you.

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:41.265
What did the police say?

00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:43.185
They're going to issue
a warrant for her arrest.

00:24:46.225 --> 00:24:47.465
Why would she do that?

00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:49.625
Maybe she wanted Lin to invest.

00:24:50.225 --> 00:24:51.945
And when I got in the way,

00:24:52.025 --> 00:24:54.145
she wanted me out of the picture.

00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:58.105
No wonder. The police said
she's got several fraud cases.

00:25:02.465 --> 00:25:04.705
Then please take care of this matter.

00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:07.545
I'll go prepare for tonight.

00:25:42.385 --> 00:25:44.025
Are you here to see Jane?

00:25:49.265 --> 00:25:50.585
She's picking up her girlfriend.

00:25:50.665 --> 00:25:52.465
We're just the extras.

00:25:52.545 --> 00:25:54.065
Can't we sneak a peak?

00:25:54.145 --> 00:25:55.785
-Let's go.
-Where to?

00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:57.545
If you're hungry, go buy something.

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:01.705
Ew.

00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:02.905
-Disgusting.
-Let's go home.

00:26:04.665 --> 00:26:06.545
Goodbye.

00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:09.505
-Get home safe.
-Bye. See you.

00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:11.065
Of course she'll get home safe.

00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:19.865
I missed you.

00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:23.985
Missed me? We were just home together.

00:26:27.305 --> 00:26:28.585
I miss my girlfriend.

00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:31.185
I miss you the moment you turn your back.

00:26:32.545 --> 00:26:34.145
Someone's crazy in love.

00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:36.505
Me?

00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:39.505
Me.

00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.705
I still remember the first day

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.705
I waited here for you
to close the restaurant.

00:27:04.145 --> 00:27:06.345
Back then, I had nothing left.

00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:09.705
Everything was falling apart.

00:27:09.785 --> 00:27:13.025
It felt like I was drowning.

00:27:14.665 --> 00:27:16.705
But today is a completely different story.

00:27:18.585 --> 00:27:20.265
I'm still unemployed,

00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:24.945
but I'm genuinely happy.

00:27:28.105 --> 00:27:29.185
Right now,

00:27:29.265 --> 00:27:31.785
I've stopped chasing success…

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:37.705
because I finally realized
it's not what I'm truly after.

00:27:40.105 --> 00:27:42.265
Happiness that doesn't require effort

00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:45.865
or a race to find.

00:27:47.345 --> 00:27:48.945
That's real happiness.

00:27:53.545 --> 00:27:56.105
So you're really not going back
to work in New York?

00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:07.545
I'm happy here.

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:10.585
I don't overthink things anymore.

00:28:11.665 --> 00:28:14.465
As for work, once they find out I'm here,

00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:16.105
the offers will come eventually.

00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:19.865
In the meantime,

00:28:19.945 --> 00:28:22.105
I'll just keep helping you
shoot your food pics.

00:28:24.465 --> 00:28:25.585
Yes.

00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:28.425
It's been ages since you came back,
and we haven't finished the menu.

00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:32.825
You know

00:28:32.905 --> 00:28:34.985
why the New York office contacted me?

00:28:37.025 --> 00:28:39.025
They said
they canceled my contract back then

00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:41.305
because at that time,

00:28:41.385 --> 00:28:43.345
my photos all looked the same.

00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:45.785
Nothing new.

00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:49.705
The photos came out boring,
nothing exciting.

00:29:16.905 --> 00:29:20.945
They reached out again
because these photos felt fun,

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:24.865
lively, like I wasn't afraid
to try something new.

00:29:24.945 --> 00:29:27.745
They said
I'd stepped out of my comfort zone.

00:29:31.065 --> 00:29:32.545
And that's all because of you.

00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:37.945
Me?

00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:40.745
I didn't do anything.

00:29:41.265 --> 00:29:44.185
I just made you take pictures of my food.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:59.385
You taught me to see
the world differently.

00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:04.425
You showed me that fashion
isn't just in magazines.

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:06.545
It's in lifestyle.

00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:10.745
And that a beautiful photo
doesn't need a beautiful model.

00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:14.945
It depends on
the person behind the camera.

00:30:15.025 --> 00:30:18.625
You figured all that out on your own.
It's not because of me.

00:30:21.305 --> 00:30:22.585
You have no idea

00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:27.305
how lucky I feel to have you.

00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:24.785
Lin.

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:27.425
What is it, Jane?

00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:29.625
Open your eyes.

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:37.865
Come sit here.

00:31:41.905 --> 00:31:43.505
So? What is it?

00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:49.345
The daisies wilted days ago.

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:53.945
I got scared you might forget
you were mine.

00:31:57.145 --> 00:32:00.785
Even without a ring, I could never forget.

00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:09.505
I'm wearing your ring.

00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:11.745
You should wear mine too.

00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:29.865
So where do you want to hold our wedding?

00:32:29.945 --> 00:32:31.305
I don't want to.

00:32:32.465 --> 00:32:33.665
Why not?

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:37.825
I'd rather hold on to the happiness
our families already have.

00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:40.905
So, no wedding at all?

00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:08.625
Auntie. Do you know
where Lin and Aunt Aom went?

00:33:08.705 --> 00:33:10.305
No idea. Why would I?

00:33:11.785 --> 00:33:14.905
Ms. Natasha Romanoff always knows
everyone's moves in that house.

00:33:14.985 --> 00:33:16.305
How come you're clueless today?

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:19.065
They didn't say anything.

00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:20.905
I'm heading out.

00:33:20.985 --> 00:33:22.865
-Where to?
-Out.

00:33:25.825 --> 00:33:27.385
What's with the black bag?

00:33:34.505 --> 00:33:35.665
Trash bag.

00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:39.785
What's wrong?

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.145
No need to call. I'm about to leave.

00:34:22.225 --> 00:34:24.905
Jane, you don't have to rush.

00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:27.225
The restaurant's fine.
We can handle it. Same old stuff.

00:34:27.304 --> 00:34:28.784
Just take your time.

00:34:28.865 --> 00:34:30.625
That's right.

00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:33.945
Normally, you always rush me to come in.
What's going on?

00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:35.784
Because it's not normal today--

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.065
Hey!

00:34:38.905 --> 00:34:41.465
There's nothing to worry about.

00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:44.505
Yes.

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:46.465
Take your time, okay?

00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:49.865
Lin's probably coming to see you.

00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:52.784
-Lin's at the restaurant?
-Yes.

00:34:52.865 --> 00:34:54.264
What's she doing there?

00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:55.705
-Well…
-It's--

00:34:57.665 --> 00:34:59.065
Well,

00:34:59.145 --> 00:35:02.985
just dress up and wait for her. Bye.

00:35:10.745 --> 00:35:12.945
You almost ruined it!

00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:17.825
Did I hang up yet? Oh, I did.

00:35:17.905 --> 00:35:19.105
You scared me.

00:35:47.825 --> 00:35:49.345
LET'S GO TAKE A PHOTO - ALIN

00:36:10.145 --> 00:36:11.305
Let's go get dressed.

00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:41.825
I told you, no wedding.

00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:43.185
It's not a wedding.

00:37:46.425 --> 00:37:48.785
Let me do something for you, okay?

00:38:05.025 --> 00:38:07.905
They say people change with time.

00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:12.025
But I'm lucky. You never did.

00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:15.265
You still love me. You still waited

00:38:15.345 --> 00:38:17.625
until the day we found each other again.

00:38:19.225 --> 00:38:22.025
I'm lucky you never left my side,

00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:24.505
and that we still have each other.

00:38:25.905 --> 00:38:28.585
We've been through so much,

00:38:29.185 --> 00:38:31.505
and we'll go through even more.

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:35.105
But none of that
will ever change how we feel.

00:38:36.985 --> 00:38:40.665
You'll have me until my very last breath.

00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:33.465
I love you, Jane.

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:34.705
I love you too, Lin.

00:40:10.105 --> 00:40:13.905
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:40:13.985 --> 00:40:18.585
From now on, we'll wake up
to each other every morning,

00:40:18.665 --> 00:40:20.785
fall asleep
in each other's arms every night,

00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:23.385
and make every minute together
full of happiness.

00:40:24.825 --> 00:40:26.745
We'll be everything to each other,

00:40:27.665 --> 00:40:29.225
with every breath we take.

00:41:05.705 --> 00:41:06.865
Busy day at the studio?

00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:08.505
A little.

00:41:14.665 --> 00:41:16.465
Aren't you going to the restaurant today?

00:41:16.545 --> 00:41:17.625
No.

00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:26.705
Why that face?

00:41:27.305 --> 00:41:28.665
Stop joking.

00:41:28.745 --> 00:41:30.705
I'm not joking.

00:41:44.745 --> 00:41:46.425
Happy birthday.

00:41:46.505 --> 00:41:49.225
How could I forget?
We were born on the same day.

00:41:50.705 --> 00:41:52.185
I thought you forgot.

00:41:52.265 --> 00:41:53.825
You've been so busy.

00:41:55.865 --> 00:41:56.825
Let me see.

00:41:59.025 --> 00:42:00.465
Thank you.

00:42:06.585 --> 00:42:07.985
Happy birthday to you too.

00:42:09.185 --> 00:42:10.585
I also have something for you.

00:42:13.425 --> 00:42:14.785
Wait a moment.

00:42:26.745 --> 00:42:28.145
Now make a wish.

00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:40.745
What did you wish for?

00:42:42.105 --> 00:42:44.705
That you'll be my safe zone forever.

00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:57.265
I think it's time we expand our safe zone.

00:43:07.105 --> 00:43:08.585
They responded?

00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:15.945
Our family is about to grow.

00:43:17.145 --> 00:43:18.265
Do Mom and Aunt Tuk know yet?

00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:20.225
I wanted to tell you first.

00:43:22.185 --> 00:43:25.065
They're going to be so happy
to have a grandkid.

00:43:40.465 --> 00:43:44.705
Jin, come help Grandma put away
the books and toys.

00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:48.585
Grandma, look!

00:43:48.665 --> 00:43:50.265
All done. Come here.

00:43:50.345 --> 00:43:52.985
-All filled up!
-I finished assembling this. Let's play!

00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:54.625
Grandma, I'm hungry.

00:43:54.705 --> 00:43:56.265
Oh? You're hungry now?

00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.905
What do you want to eat today, sweetie?

00:43:58.985 --> 00:44:00.905
I want Mommy's five-spice eggs!

00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:03.025
-Ooh, five-spice eggs.
-Should we eat at home

00:44:03.105 --> 00:44:04.985
or go to the restaurant?

00:44:05.065 --> 00:44:07.145
Can I go see Mommy at the restaurant?

00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:11.545
Who's here?

00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:14.305
Careful!

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.545
Walk slowly.

00:44:15.625 --> 00:44:16.945
Be careful.

00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:18.305
Be careful, Jin.

00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:23.465
Can we go see Mommy Jane?

00:44:23.545 --> 00:44:24.385
Of course.

00:44:26.105 --> 00:44:27.465
I can't keep up with her.

00:44:28.785 --> 00:44:31.865
Take her to the restaurant.
Let her play there.

00:44:32.825 --> 00:44:34.425
Your mom and I could use a break.

00:44:37.225 --> 00:44:38.105
Let's go.

00:44:42.545 --> 00:44:45.065
It looks just like
the photo of you in your wedding dress.

00:44:45.905 --> 00:44:47.945
That's because we really got married here.

00:44:48.025 --> 00:44:50.585
I want to wear a white dress like you too!

00:44:50.665 --> 00:44:52.025
What are you two doing?

00:44:54.585 --> 00:44:56.025
Jin said

00:44:56.105 --> 00:44:57.985
she wants to wear
a wedding dress like ours.

00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:04.745
Someday, when you grow up

00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:08.185
and find someone
who means the world to you,

00:45:10.745 --> 00:45:12.345
I'll give you the dress.

00:45:12.425 --> 00:45:13.545
Really?

00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:16.905
By then,

00:45:17.985 --> 00:45:21.705
You can wear Mommy Lin's
or Mommy Jane's, whichever you like.

00:45:22.945 --> 00:45:24.185
Promise?

00:45:24.265 --> 00:45:25.465
Promise.

00:45:26.825 --> 00:45:28.185
Promise.

00:45:35.545 --> 00:45:38.065
I'm going to play with Bam and Pete.

00:45:38.145 --> 00:45:39.345
Okay.

00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:40.385
Be careful not to fall.

00:45:55.225 --> 00:45:56.345
After all this time,

00:45:57.225 --> 00:45:59.745
I always knew waiting for you
would be worth it.

00:46:01.265 --> 00:46:03.345
And it really is,

00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:07.225
because we're finally together.

00:46:18.145 --> 00:46:19.705
Turns out happiness is really simple.

00:46:42.745 --> 00:46:46.945
I don't have to
chase after happiness anymore,

00:46:47.025 --> 00:46:50.465
because it's right here with me, always.

00:47:26.025 --> 00:47:28.265
