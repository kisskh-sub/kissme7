00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:13.868
Li Jen-yao.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.829
Li Jen-yao.

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:17.956
Can you hear me?

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.375
Li Jen-yao.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:22.001
Li Jen-yao, are you awake?

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:36.099
Your eyelids were twitching,
as if you were about to wake up,

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:37.725
so I came closer to check.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:42.814
Do you feel okay?

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.198
You're injured. Don't get up yet.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.913
Why am I here?

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:01.040
On my way home,

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:03.501
I saw you pass by on your motorbike.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.003
Then there was a bang.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:07.714
When I looked over,
I saw you had fallen off.

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:10.049
You were lying on the ground
and unresponsive.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.301
There was no passerby.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:13.720
I was afraid you'd die,
so I called an ambulance.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.430
Young man, you're awake.

00:01:15.513 --> 00:01:18.183
The doctor said earlier
that your condition is stable.

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:22.061
Mostly external injuries,
but you might have a concussion,

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:25.231
so you should stay overnight
for observation.

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:26.774
Since you're awake,

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:29.485
you can ask your family
to help with the admission process.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.738
Otherwise, we can't transfer you
to a regular ward.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:33.907
Okay, I got it. Thank you.

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:37.869
What's your home number?
I'll call them for you.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.415
No need to call.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.959
They won't come.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.554
TAI-EN HOSPITAL

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:12.654
Hello, why did you call me?

00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:14.447
Hsiao-tung, what were you doing?

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.199
You didn't answer the home phone.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.705
I was sleeping.

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.167
I heard it, but I was too sleepy,
so I didn't answer it.

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:28.711
It's just past 9:00.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.964
When have you ever gone to sleep
this early?

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:34.092
You… My dance practice went longer today.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:35.551
I'm exhausted.

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:37.011
Aren't you busy now?

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.764
You're slacking off just to call me.
Mom might scold you.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.975
Goodness. You don't understand, okay?

00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:44.769
Your mom hits and scolds me
because she loves me.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.271
Huh! Yeah, right.

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:49.691
All right, I'm off to bed. Bye.

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:57.699
No need to call.

00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.742
They won't come.

00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:07.750
He was brought in
after passing out in a car crash.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.794
He's a minor,
but his family's unreachable,

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:10.962
so we reported it.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:12.380
-Is he awake?
-Yes.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:13.798
-I'll take you over.
-Okay.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.687
Li Jen-yao, there you are.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.023
I think the nurse called the police.

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:32.025
-I'll search over there.
-Okay.

00:05:58.337 --> 00:06:04.635
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:11.851
Earlier, I…

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:13.603
I know.

00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:15.897
You were dodging the cops.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.191
But you didn't hit anyone.

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:19.567
Why are you dodging them?

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:25.031
I don't have a license yet.
There'd be trouble if I get caught.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:27.783
I see.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.702
Is my bike still there?

00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:33.873
Yes. It should still be there.

00:06:33.956 --> 00:06:37.585
When I got in the ambulance,
I saw that it was still there.

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:40.796
You aren't going to get it now, are you?

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.969
Thank you for today.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.013
It's very late.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.182
You should go home.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.064
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:00.566
I'll go with you.

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:03.069
No need.

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:04.779
You might have a concussion.

00:07:04.862 --> 00:07:06.906
What if you collapse on the street
and die?

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.909
Since I saved you,
I wanna ensure you stay safe.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:12.703
Anyway, I'll only leave
after I see you home safely.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:17.333
Suit yourself.

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.213
It stinks, right?

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:08.134
You can't see the sun here,
even during the day.

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:14.098
Since it's dark, garbage is everywhere,

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:17.059
mixed with the smell of fish

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.728
and rotten meat.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.690
But even if it stinks that bad,

00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.861
you get used to it after a while.

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.759
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:58.953
You're not going home yet?

00:10:00.705 --> 00:10:03.708
Hey, I was worried about you,
so I walked you home.

00:10:03.791 --> 00:10:05.209
Why talk to me like that?

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.585
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:10:40.745 --> 00:10:44.081
Where are your parents?
They're still out at this time of night?

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:46.959
Can you go home now?

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:52.256
I'm just concerned about you.
Why are you talking to me like that?

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.555
You want to check in on me?

00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:01.432
Fine.

00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:05.603
My dad is a scumbag.

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:08.355
He's unemployed and gambles every day.

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:12.109
Whenever he gets drunk,
he takes it out on me and my mom.

00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:17.615
He owes a lot of money.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:21.452
Now that he can't pay it back,

00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:24.038
my mom has rushed to pack up

00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.831
and run off with that scumbag.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:31.295
She's only left 5,000 dollars
and told me to take care of myself.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.006
Are you satisfied now?

00:11:36.884 --> 00:11:37.968
What about you?

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:41.764
They just abandoned you?

00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:47.770
They didn't abandon me.

00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:52.817
I just don't need them.

00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:59.406
He has a lot of old injuries,
and they're not minor.

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.326
His medical records indicate

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:05.120
that he was abused at home
when he was little.

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.252
I'm home now.

00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:12.378
Everything's okay.

00:12:16.674 --> 00:12:17.633
Can you go now?

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.771
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:20.404
Good morning.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.156
Morning.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.494
Hey. Eat up.

00:13:31.457 --> 00:13:32.917
What?

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:37.296
Why are there dark circles
around your eyes? I know.

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:40.424
That's the trendy smoky eye makeup, yeah?

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:42.384
This isn't smoky eye makeup.

00:13:42.468 --> 00:13:44.595
These are dark circles
from poor sleep, okay?

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:46.847
But when I called you yesterday,

00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:48.474
you said you were sleeping.

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:51.185
Why do you have dark circles
after sleeping so much?

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:55.481
Well… I slept too much,
which is why I didn't sleep well.

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:57.358
Okay.

00:13:58.651 --> 00:13:59.652
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:01.862
I'd like more food in my lunchbox today.

00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:04.365
I already put in a lot of food. Look.

00:14:04.448 --> 00:14:05.282
Here.

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:09.828
Hey… You… Wait.

00:14:09.912 --> 00:14:11.747
Didn't you just reach your target weight?

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.500
You… Isn't this too much for lunch?

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:16.835
Don't come crying to me
when you gain weight again.

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:19.505
It's fine. Otherwise,
I'll get hungry in the afternoon.

00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:20.673
I'll diet if I have to.

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:21.674
You…

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.884
Fine.

00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:27.179
I'll eat breakfast at school.

00:14:27.262 --> 00:14:28.097
-Okay.
-Sure.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.431
-I'm going to school.
-Okay.

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:31.308
Okay. Take care.

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.309
Okay.

00:14:39.984 --> 00:14:41.068
Hey.

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:42.778
Is this for school or worship?

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:44.071
Okay, school time, bye.

00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:47.199
-Wait, what's with the big lunch?
-Off I go.

00:14:47.282 --> 00:14:48.784
-I can't believe it.
-Bye.

00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:11.432
SECOND-YEAR DANCE STUDENT
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG WINS FIRST PRIZE

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:16.603
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG TRIUMPHS
IN YOUTH BALLET COMPETITION

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.404
Li Jen-yao.

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:36.331
How much will you embarrass the school
before you're satisfied?

00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:38.667
The police informed us this morning.

00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.585
Hey!

00:15:39.668 --> 00:15:42.379
They said you rode a motorbike illegally,

00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:45.090
got into an accident,
and left the hospital against advice.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:47.509
Incredible.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.595
Are you made of steel?

00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:50.512
How ridiculous!

00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:54.391
Do you know what you did
isn't just a violation of school rules?

00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.809
It's against the law!

00:15:58.062 --> 00:16:00.314
If the school
didn't care about protecting students,

00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:02.149
they would've reported you long ago.

00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:04.401
Li Jen-yao,

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:07.821
do you know that
any misconduct by you outside of school

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:11.325
will humiliate and embarrass
every student who wears the same uniform?

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:13.368
What is it?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.673
From now on,
I hope you'll realize your mistakes,

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:30.177
reflect on yourself, and do better.
Do you hear me?

00:16:33.931 --> 00:16:35.015
Do you hear me?

00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:44.108
-What?
-Give me some. That's a full lunch.

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:45.776
-What do you want to eat?
-Beef.

00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:47.653
-Is this beef?
-Disgusting.

00:16:47.736 --> 00:16:50.948
It doesn't look good at all, okay?
It tastes so bad, fuck.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.950
Yu-hsiang, what are you eating?

00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:10.008
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:14.263
You're the only one who hasn't paid
the class fee. When will you pay?

00:17:14.346 --> 00:17:16.348
You forgot how much
his family owes the Ouyangs?

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:18.809
-How can he afford the class fee?
-Right.

00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:21.603
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:24.273
You can't even pay 600 NTD
for the class fee.

00:17:24.356 --> 00:17:25.440
Are your family all beggars?

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:26.984
Do you want to eat my food?

00:17:27.067 --> 00:17:29.027
-Even beggars are richer than he is.
-Beggar.

00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:30.195
Do you want a bite?

00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:33.949
Beggar.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.453
Pay before school ends tomorrow.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.877
Hsiao-tung, you're here
to have lunch with me, right?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.295
-Give me a second.
-Yun-chen.

00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:49.214
Does your class
always bully people like that?

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:54.428
I told you before.
They've had beef since their first year.

00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:57.764
Your girl's here.

00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:04.229
Don't talk nonsense.

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.148
I haven't won her over yet.

00:18:07.316 --> 00:18:08.817
I'll get my lunchbox. Hang on.

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:10.152
I've got other things to do.

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:11.820
-I can't eat with you.
-Hey.

00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:28.337
That's so loud. Someone's hungry.

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:37.971
I've been looking for you.
So you're hiding here again.

00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:42.935
Why were you looking for me?

00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:45.229
It's nothing.

00:18:45.729 --> 00:18:48.023
I have no idea
what was up with my mom this morning.

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:50.025
She put half a chicken in my lunchbox.

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:54.363
Try holding it.
It's half a chicken. So heavy.

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:58.784
Hey.

00:18:58.867 --> 00:19:01.370
You didn't forget that you promised

00:19:01.453 --> 00:19:04.081
to eat my lunch for me
while I'm on a diet, did you?

00:19:07.042 --> 00:19:09.711
Why are you so nice
to someone you don't know at all?

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:16.510
You're so mean.

00:19:17.177 --> 00:19:19.930
You ate my lunch,
and you say we're not close.

00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:22.391
Let's say we weren't close before.

00:19:22.474 --> 00:19:24.977
I took you to the hospital
when you got hurt yesterday,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.436
and I went home with you.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.146
That means we're friends, right?

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:30.232
You think you care?

00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:32.234
I think you're pitying me.

00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:34.444
You're giving me all this food.

00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:35.612
You think I'm a stray?

00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:38.407
Do you expect me to treat you
like a master and wag my tail?

00:19:43.203 --> 00:19:44.246
No, I don't.

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:54.131
We're from different worlds.

00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:56.091
You and I cannot be friends.

00:19:56.174 --> 00:19:57.384
Why not?

00:19:59.594 --> 00:20:02.472
Anyone would think…

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.102
you only treat me like a friend
because you pity me.

00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:13.066
If I talk to you,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.486
everyone else would think
that I'm trash seeking your sympathy.

00:20:24.953 --> 00:20:26.038
So…

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:30.042
don't come to me again.

00:20:31.543 --> 00:20:34.046
What's more, don't say things
like "we're friends."

00:20:35.213 --> 00:20:36.214
From now on,

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:37.924
just act like I'm not there.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:20:59.488
Lower.

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:12.751
Chiang Hsiao-tung, focus.

00:21:16.963 --> 00:21:18.090
Extend.

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:22.010
Point your toes.

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:30.727
I'm so exhausted.

00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:33.021
Try to get some rest today.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.774
Don't you think
the teacher is really strict?

00:21:36.441 --> 00:21:37.275
She's okay.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:38.777
She always scolds us.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.570
-Really?
-Hey.

00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:44.241
Are you going home? I can go with you.

00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:46.326
No need. I have practice.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.537
That's okay. I can wait for you.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.956
I can treat you to dinner afterward.

00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:53.834
No need. My dad is picking me up.

00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:56.211
Thank you. Thanks.

00:22:22.946 --> 00:22:24.030
A stray dog?

00:22:25.157 --> 00:22:26.825
Stray dogs are much cuter than you.

00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:30.203
At least they won't bite me
when I feed them.

00:22:30.829 --> 00:22:33.457
What are you mumbling about?
What stray dogs?

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:37.085
Nothing. A mad dog bit me for no reason.

00:22:38.044 --> 00:22:39.463
It's fine. Let's go.

00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:49.681
You're so cute.

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.020
Unlike a certain person.

00:22:55.103 --> 00:22:56.605
I think you're pitying me.

00:22:56.688 --> 00:22:58.148
You're giving me all this food.

00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.524
You think I'm a stray dog?

00:22:59.608 --> 00:23:02.152
You expect me to treat you
like a master and wag my tail?

00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:03.487
From now on,

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.197
just act like I'm not there.

00:23:44.528 --> 00:23:46.780
I was gonna treat you
like a stranger, as you wished,

00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:48.949
but one thing kept making me angrier.

00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:49.950
Let's talk.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.996
I bought drumsticks and rice for you
on my way since they're delicious.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.997
Eat it if you want.

00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.378
Why did you come looking for me?

00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:03.838
Didn't I make it clear to you already?

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:06.007
How was it clear
if you did all the talking?

00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:09.261
Plus, who gave you the right
to call all the shots?

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:14.057
I treated you like a friend
'cause we met and got to know each other.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.226
That's how everyone makes friends.

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:19.062
How is that sympathy and pity to you?

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:20.564
Are you stupid?

00:24:20.647 --> 00:24:22.482
I just want to be your friend.

00:24:23.483 --> 00:24:24.985
But I don't wanna be your friend.

00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:27.195
Why?

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:30.740
-Because people would say--
-Friends or not, it's between us.

00:24:30.824 --> 00:24:32.450
What's that got to do with anyone else?

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:34.244
Why does anyone else
have to know about it?

00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:36.037
Is being friends an act for other people?

00:24:36.121 --> 00:24:37.455
That can't be what you think.

00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:40.292
Haven't you heard
what people say about me?

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:43.712
I'm a weirdo who's an outcast in class
and hated by the whole school.

00:24:44.838 --> 00:24:46.798
I don't get why you want to be friends.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:48.341
So?

00:24:48.842 --> 00:24:49.676
So what?

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.679
Can you stop belittling yourself?

00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:55.599
Look at me. I have a pierced ear.

00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:57.225
I have a tattoo on my hand.

00:24:57.726 --> 00:24:59.853
I wear a short skirt and makeup to school.

00:24:59.936 --> 00:25:03.064
In my first year,
I won first place in a dance competition.

00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:05.066
Someone started rumors
that I was an escort

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.860
and had a sugar daddy,

00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:08.361
that I won because I had a backer.

00:25:09.487 --> 00:25:12.073
Do you think those rumors are true?

00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:21.833
What people say is their business.

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:23.585
I only believe what I see.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.588
I think you're great.

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:29.382
The things you said that happened to you

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:32.385
are not your fault,
and you didn't want it to happen.

00:25:32.969 --> 00:25:33.845
Right?

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.779
In that case, apologize to me now.

00:25:52.822 --> 00:25:53.657
Why?

00:25:56.493 --> 00:26:00.163
Because I sent you to the hospital
when you got hurt in the accident.

00:26:00.914 --> 00:26:02.624
I was worried about your injury

00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:04.042
and walked you home.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.460
I was afraid you'd be hungry,

00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:07.587
and I came all the way here
to bring you food.

00:26:10.006 --> 00:26:13.176
Yet you chased me away for lame reasons.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.181
Don't you think you owe me an apology?

00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:35.865
I'm sorry.

00:26:41.371 --> 00:26:42.497
It's okay.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.621
Yun-chen. Why are you here?
Have you been here long?

00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:12.582
Not really. Just a little while.

00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:15.251
Why didn't you just come in?
Why are you standing outside?

00:30:16.294 --> 00:30:17.629
It's okay.

00:30:17.712 --> 00:30:19.797
It's nothing important anyway.

00:30:20.798 --> 00:30:24.510
I just wanted to tell you
that I have no plans after school today.

00:30:24.594 --> 00:30:25.970
Do you wanna go home together?

00:30:26.054 --> 00:30:26.888
Okay.

00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:29.599
Give me a second.
I'll pack up and change quickly.

00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:31.559
-Take your time. No rush.
-Just a sec.

00:30:31.643 --> 00:30:32.518
Okay.

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:49.243
-Hey.
-Yeah?

00:30:49.327 --> 00:30:50.787
To be honest,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.790
I'm quite nervous
about the end-of-semester show.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.376
You're nervous? Why?

00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:59.671
The school values the dance class highly,

00:30:59.754 --> 00:31:01.506
and this is a chance to promote it.

00:31:01.589 --> 00:31:04.676
So they invited a principal dancer
from a Parisian troupe that I love

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:05.885
to be the special guest.

00:31:07.261 --> 00:31:09.472
Just the thought
of dancing in front of her

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:10.932
makes me nervous.

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:12.517
I'm afraid…

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.978
What are you afraid of?
That you won't dance well?

00:31:15.478 --> 00:31:17.647
Gosh, please. You don't know ballet, okay?

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.565
If you did, you'd know I dance very well.

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:24.112
Even though I don't know ballet,

00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:27.115
I can still tell that you dance well.

00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:34.414
When I watched you dance
at school earlier,

00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:37.458
I really thought you danced so well.

00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:41.838
You'll surely be the brightest star
of this performance.

00:31:43.006 --> 00:31:43.881
Obviously.

00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:44.841
Who am I?

00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:46.342
That's a given, okay?

00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:51.180
To be honest,

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:53.933
I really want her to watch me dance.

00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:58.521
I really hope
she'll tell me that I have talent,

00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:02.859
that I have what it takes
to go on to dance professionally like her.

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:07.030
This performance is very important,
more so than any contest.

00:32:07.947 --> 00:32:08.990
You've got this.

00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:27.967
Grandma.

00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:31.637
Yun-chen. It's so late,
and you're still not home.

00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:33.765
Do you know how worried I was about you?

00:32:35.516 --> 00:32:37.894
Hi, Mrs. Lai.
I'm Chiang Hsiao-tung, Yun-chen's--

00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:39.353
Sorry, Grandma.

00:32:39.437 --> 00:32:41.564
I lost track of time.

00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:44.734
Let's go home.

00:32:45.401 --> 00:32:47.361
Aren't you gonna say goodbye
to your friend?

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:51.532
She's not really my friend,

00:32:51.616 --> 00:32:53.826
just a schoolmate.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.078
I see.

00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:34.700
Good morning, sir.

00:33:34.784 --> 00:33:36.285
Good morning, students.

00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:39.122
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

00:34:18.995 --> 00:34:20.705
I'll go to school, then, Grandma.

00:34:20.788 --> 00:34:22.915
I'll pick you up after school.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.500
Don't make me wait too long.

00:34:26.127 --> 00:34:28.379
Got it. Bye.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.875
Hsiao-tung.

00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:10.129
Where are you going?

00:35:12.298 --> 00:35:14.217
I've made lunch plans with a friend.

00:35:17.595 --> 00:35:20.389
You're not meeting Li Jen-yao, are you?

00:35:20.473 --> 00:35:23.184
Didn't I already tell you
to stay away from him?

00:35:24.352 --> 00:35:28.439
Yes, but I also remember
you told your grandma we're not friends.

00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:31.025
Since we're not friends,

00:35:31.108 --> 00:35:33.694
who I hang out with
is none of your business, right?

00:35:37.281 --> 00:35:38.282
Hsiao…

00:35:49.502 --> 00:35:50.544
Are you in a bad mood?

00:35:52.255 --> 00:35:53.089
Yeah.

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:54.924
A little.

00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.553
Why are you in a bad mood?

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:03.099
I don't know how to describe it.

00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:08.479
It's fine if you don't want to tell me.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.399
I just want to tell you

00:36:12.358 --> 00:36:15.987
that if you need someone to talk to
about what's on your mind

00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:19.031
but don't know who to turn to,

00:36:20.283 --> 00:36:22.034
you can talk to me. It's okay.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:28.249
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:30.918
What?

00:36:31.669 --> 00:36:34.046
Are you comforting me now?

00:36:44.932 --> 00:36:47.893
Isn't that what friends do?

00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:53.274
Why are you smiling?

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:56.277
It's nothing.

00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:58.237
Thank you.

00:36:58.779 --> 00:37:01.157
I feel a bit better now.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.244
CAPTURE

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.913
SAVED TO PHOTOS

00:37:22.678 --> 00:37:25.264
If you need someone to talk to
about what's on your mind

00:37:25.765 --> 00:37:28.017
but don't know who to turn to,

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:30.895
you can talk to me. It's okay.

00:37:31.479 --> 00:37:34.273
Are you comforting me now?

00:37:35.483 --> 00:37:38.277
Isn't that what friends do?

00:37:49.663 --> 00:37:50.664
Stop.

00:37:50.748 --> 00:37:51.999
Chang En-ya.

00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.876
Do you know what your problem is?

00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:55.795
Your legs get weak after a bit of dancing.

00:37:55.878 --> 00:37:57.880
You're wasting my time. Go away.

00:37:57.963 --> 00:38:00.466
Next. Lai Ting-yi, come up.

00:38:05.388 --> 00:38:06.889
Hurry.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.600
Is Chiang Hsiao-tung here?

00:38:12.937 --> 00:38:14.897
Change out of your dance clothes now.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.524
Come to the office with me.

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:26.409
Li Jen-yao.

00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:28.828
Come here.

00:38:30.037 --> 00:38:32.039
The rest of you,
study on your own quietly.

00:38:39.046 --> 00:38:39.880
Hey.

00:38:40.381 --> 00:38:42.758
Who knows what Li Jen-yao did this time?

00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:45.386
Damn it.
Did you set him up secretly again?

00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:46.720
Why didn't you invite me?

00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:48.305
Here's the thing.

00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:50.891
Ouyang and I were
at the military instructors' office

00:38:50.975 --> 00:38:52.810
and heard a student report

00:38:52.893 --> 00:38:56.730
that he had been banging his girl
on the rooftop during lunch break.

00:38:57.314 --> 00:38:58.232
Seriously?

00:38:58.315 --> 00:38:59.900
Fan Wei-ting, don't talk nonsense.

00:38:59.984 --> 00:39:01.193
They just said

00:39:01.277 --> 00:39:03.988
there might be kissing,
hugging, and indecent behavior.

00:39:04.071 --> 00:39:05.656
Nothing crazy like banging.

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:08.492
As if. Haven't you watched baseball?

00:39:08.576 --> 00:39:10.995
If you get to third base
and no one is covering home plate,

00:39:11.078 --> 00:39:12.455
why not make a run for it?

00:39:12.538 --> 00:39:13.914
-I would.
-Me too.

00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:17.751
Which class is the girl he banged in?

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:19.462
-Damn it.
-Fuck, is she pretty?

00:39:19.545 --> 00:39:20.588
I'd be mad if she were.

00:39:20.671 --> 00:39:22.673
Idiot, what's that got to do with you?

00:39:22.756 --> 00:39:24.717
Why don't you take a look at yourself?

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.260
You're one to talk.

00:39:26.844 --> 00:39:28.012
Guys.

00:39:28.512 --> 00:39:30.181
It's self-study time.

00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:32.183
It's up to you what you do,

00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:34.685
but please be quiet
and don't disturb the other classes.

00:39:36.353 --> 00:39:37.771
Okay, we'll keep it down.

00:39:37.855 --> 00:39:38.856
This.

00:39:38.939 --> 00:39:40.024
Lower your voice.

00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:48.324
Shush, quiet down.

00:40:02.213 --> 00:40:04.632
Say what? How could I do that?

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:07.343
That's right. I told you,
this is impossible.

00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:09.345
Hsiao-tung's been busy practicing.

00:40:09.428 --> 00:40:12.014
How could she have time to date?

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:13.724
Our school is different.

00:40:13.807 --> 00:40:16.435
We have clear rules on dating in school.

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:19.188
Last semester,
the school specifically published

00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:21.565
the student code of conduct guidelines.

00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:24.777
It states that improper contact
between students is not permitted,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.238
nor is inappropriate correspondence.

00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.740
Violators will be punished
per school rules.

00:40:30.449 --> 00:40:34.119
I also want to believe
that you didn't break any school rules.

00:40:34.203 --> 00:40:36.830
But the student who reported you
provided proof.

00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:39.124
I have no reason to doubt what she said.

00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:43.337
You're not meeting Li Jen-yao, are you?

00:40:43.837 --> 00:40:46.507
Didn't I already tell you
to stay away from him?

00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:51.804
Ma'am, is the one who reported me
in class two of year two?

00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:55.140
It doesn't matter who reported you.

00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:58.477
What's important is that I know
this boy is often badly behaved.

00:40:58.561 --> 00:40:59.979
He's not a good student.

00:41:00.062 --> 00:41:01.230
Be honest with me.

00:41:01.313 --> 00:41:03.399
When that incident happened
on the rooftop,

00:41:03.482 --> 00:41:04.900
did you feel coerced?

00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:07.486
We're just friends who had lunch together.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.071
Why do you make it sound so bad?

00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:12.575
Given your usual performance,
I don't want to give you a hard time.

00:41:12.658 --> 00:41:14.827
Now, if you'd just write a statement

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.247
promising that from now on
you'll keep your distance from him

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.750
and that you won't be alone with him,
either in or out of school,

00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:24.295
perhaps I could still de-escalate
this matter for you.

00:41:26.714 --> 00:41:28.465
Li Jen-yao.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:30.801
Staying silent won't solve anything.

00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:33.554
What exactly did you and that girl do
on the rooftop?

00:41:35.889 --> 00:41:37.766
Anyway, if you get a major demerit,

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.102
you'll just get probation
or be expelled at most.

00:41:40.185 --> 00:41:42.605
It's no big deal to someone like you.

00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:45.190
But have you considered the girl?

00:41:46.525 --> 00:41:49.236
After what you did to her,
she might get a major demerit

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.614
and lose the chance
to represent the school in competitions.

00:41:52.197 --> 00:41:55.659
Her chances for special admission
and further studies may also be affected.

00:42:04.001 --> 00:42:05.919
Let's say we weren't close before.

00:42:06.003 --> 00:42:08.922
I took you to the hospital
when you got hurt yesterday,

00:42:09.006 --> 00:42:10.299
and I went home with you.

00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:12.426
That means we're friends, right?

00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:18.223
Chiang Hsiao-tung and I aren't dating.

00:42:19.183 --> 00:42:20.517
She's not interested in me.

00:42:21.644 --> 00:42:23.771
I forced her
to go to the school's rooftop.

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:27.274
What did you say? Explain it clearly.

00:42:29.485 --> 00:42:30.319
Ma'am.

00:42:41.789 --> 00:42:43.457
How many times do I have to say it?

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.125
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:42:45.209 --> 00:42:47.503
Nothing will change,
even if you call my parents in.

00:42:47.586 --> 00:42:50.464
I won't admit to any mistake,
and I won't sign a statement.

00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:53.801
Hsiao-tung, don't get agitated.
Don't yell at the military instructor.

00:42:53.884 --> 00:42:55.969
We're working to find a solution
to your problem.

00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:00.140
Yes.

00:43:07.606 --> 00:43:09.441
Lai Yun-chen already admitted

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:13.195
she was the one behaving intimately
with Li Jen-yao on the rooftop.

00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:16.323
Li Jen-yao didn't deny it either.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.368
Lai Yun-chen even mentioned

00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:22.329
that you'd surely protect her
since you're a good friend.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.708
Even if others misunderstood you,
you wouldn't tell the truth.

00:44:10.252 --> 00:44:11.086
Go shower.

00:44:53.045 --> 00:44:53.962
Grandma.

00:44:57.966 --> 00:44:59.301
You're filthy.

00:44:59.384 --> 00:45:00.803
Sorry, I know my mistake.

00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:02.221
Grandma, I'm sorry.

00:45:03.347 --> 00:45:05.808
How long have you known Li Jen-yao?

00:45:05.891 --> 00:45:09.812
You didn't come home last night.
Were you with him?

00:45:11.188 --> 00:45:13.190
Grandma, don't do this. It really hurts.

00:45:13.273 --> 00:45:15.150
I'm sorry.

00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:16.985
Answer me!

00:45:17.653 --> 00:45:19.446
Did you two kiss?

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:22.407
Are you still a virgin?

00:45:22.491 --> 00:45:23.909
Answer me!

00:45:24.993 --> 00:45:27.746
Grandma, don't do this.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.581
Grandma, sorry, it's my fault.

00:45:29.665 --> 00:45:30.749
I'm sorry.

00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:32.626
You're just like your mom.

00:45:33.293 --> 00:45:34.545
Cheap, disgraceful,

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:36.880
and filthy!

00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:39.800
It's useless,
no matter how well I treat you!

00:45:39.883 --> 00:45:42.052
It's useless! You're filthy.

00:53:28.643 --> 00:53:33.648
