The last one is cute.

00:00:07.487 --> 00:00:09.656
Hey, the one on the left is hot.

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.658
I was hard the whole time.

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:13.243
Fuck, you're still hard now?

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:14.244
Fuck, are you dumb?

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:16.913
Those are ballet clothes,
not underwear and stockings.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.707
-You're still hard?
-It's… Yeah.

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.042
-You're hard?
-Show me.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:22.168
No.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.657
Help me.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:55.702
Help.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:57.412
Help me.

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.216
Fuck!

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.346
Fuck!

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.849
Fuck!

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:20.768
Fuck!

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:38.661
Fuck! I'm going to kill you!

00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:44.042
You're dead!

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:53.676
I'm going to kill you.

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:55.678
I…

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.555
I'm going to kill you.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:02:00.516
I'm going to kill you.

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:03.603
I'm going to kill you.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.313
Darling.

00:02:06.564 --> 00:02:07.690
I'm going to kill you.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.234
Darling, what's wrong?

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.154
Did you have a nightmare again?

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:14.489
I'm going to kill you.

00:02:15.073 --> 00:02:17.742
It's all right. Mom's here.

00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.620
Mom's here. It's okay.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:23.248
It was just a nightmare, okay?

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.792
Don't be scared. Mom's here. Don't--

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.460
Who's scared of him?!

00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.548
Who's scared of him?! Who…

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:41.099
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:43.893
I misspoke.

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:45.353
It's my fault.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.398
The doctor said the reason you often

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:50.817
do this…

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.237
is something psychological.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.948
If you don't want to see a doctor,

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.243
then how about I take you to a temple?

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:03.997
I know of a master who's good at treating

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.541
this.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:12.839
I'll wash the bedsheet for you.

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:17.719
I won't let anyone know about this.

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.179
If…

00:03:20.263 --> 00:03:24.767
if you want me to buy… adult diapers,

00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.519
I can buy them for you too.

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:28.855
-Just tell me--
-Are you fucking done yet?!

00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:31.357
Even you look down on me, don't you?!

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:34.819
Even you think I'm useless, don't you?!

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:35.820
Don't you?!

00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:37.989
Don't you?!

00:03:51.377 --> 00:03:53.171
Darling, don't be like this.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.089
I don't think--

00:03:55.673 --> 00:03:57.633
You're the most useless,

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:58.551
you know?

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:03.806
Why didn't you kill Li Jen-yao
when he was in prison?

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.184
Why didn't you kill him?

00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:07.894
Speak!

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:09.979
You're the most useless!

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.357
Who made me

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:14.192
turn out this way?

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:16.694
Why didn't you kill him?!

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:19.530
Who made me turn out this way?!

00:04:19.614 --> 00:04:21.491
It's all because of you!

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:22.909
It's because of you!

00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:24.994
You're useless! Trash!

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:27.872
You're the most useless.
How dare you talk about me!

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:30.666
Are you looking down on me?!

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:34.045
You're looking down on me.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.672
You're useless. It's all because of you!

00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:38.299
Speak!

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:39.384
What?!

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:43.012
Speak!

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:12.852
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:24.155
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:27.783
Do you know
if that family still lives here?

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.620
They moved out a while ago.

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:33.956
Do you know where they are now

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.791
or how I can reach them?

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.543
No, I don't.

00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:38.794
I'm sorry.

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.821
FOR RENT, FURNISHED, 9,000 NTD

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.242
Where exactly did you go?

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:53.703
Oh, you are up.

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:58.541
Just a moment. The coffee's almost done.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.263
Good morning.

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:13.639
Good morning.

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:25.693
How did you get these injuries?

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:31.115
They were

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:33.826
from when my dad used to beat me.

00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.006
I can't imagine that.

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:49.967
Why would someone
treat their child that way?

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:01.729
That's all in the past now.

00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:09.612
If we had met earlier,

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:13.199
would our lives have been different?

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.361
I can't stop you two.

00:09:52.071 --> 00:09:53.823
So you'd better keep your word.

00:10:09.797 --> 00:10:10.923
Offer flowers.

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:17.638
Next, the Lai Foundation.

00:10:17.722 --> 00:10:18.848
Please be ready.

00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:22.184
Please bow to the deceased. One.

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:26.021
The ritual is complete.
Please return to your seats.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.609
Yun-chen.

00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:33.154
This is madam's…

00:10:33.237 --> 00:10:35.030
-Granddaughter.
-I see.

00:10:35.573 --> 00:10:36.782
You're finally dead.

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:57.720
Class leader?

00:10:58.637 --> 00:11:01.307
It's been a while.
Here for your grandma's funeral?

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:05.436
Let's have a meal some time.

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:08.773
Hey, you can invite Chiang Hsiao-tung too.

00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:12.276
But I heard she's dead.

00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:14.528
I think it was suicide.

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:16.489
You… you didn't know?

00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:20.826
Explain it to me.
Why did you say it was suicide?

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.369
What exactly happened to her?

00:11:22.912 --> 00:11:26.582
Calm down.
I don't know if she's really dead.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:29.084
Everyone just says she killed herself.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.253
I think it's such a pity.

00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:32.755
I think about her often too.

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:35.424
All right.

00:11:35.508 --> 00:11:37.760
Let's meet while we still can.
We were classmates.

00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:39.637
My condolences. I'll head inside.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.646
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:11:48.729 --> 00:11:49.980
Here you go.

00:12:05.371 --> 00:12:07.206
You forgot your drink from Dad.

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:22.221
Thank you.

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:34.984
What? Do you like handsome guys?

00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.695
You never give me one.
I always get it myself.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.822
-Here, give it to Dad.
-Bad girl.

00:12:40.406 --> 00:12:42.533
-Give it to Dad.
-One for me? How nice of you.

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:43.826
Big K.

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:48.998
Can we talk later?

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:52.543
What did you say?

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:54.920
I said…

00:12:57.298 --> 00:12:58.173
this is my last month.

00:13:00.217 --> 00:13:01.051
Why?

00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:09.476
You found her.

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:17.902
Hang on.

00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:22.489
Hi, Mighty Good Cleaning.

00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:29.330
Sorry, you've asked the wrong guy.

00:13:29.413 --> 00:13:31.832
I'm not in touch with that family anymore.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:36.629
Fuck. What the hell do you mean?

00:13:37.254 --> 00:13:39.673
I told you.
I'm not involved with them anymore.

00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:43.427
I don't know where that jerk is,
what he's doing, or what he's up to.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.720
Nor do I want to know.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:46.764
Get it? Don't call again.

00:13:46.847 --> 00:13:47.973
Why did he call me?

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:55.147
It was an old friend.

00:13:56.148 --> 00:13:57.691
He was asking about your classmate.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:01.236
He said your classmate's underling
slept with a boss's woman.

00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:03.405
The gang is now looking for him.

00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:14.541
You really don't know where Ouyang Ti is?

00:14:18.796 --> 00:14:20.714
Back then, to get out,

00:14:20.798 --> 00:14:22.925
do you know the price I paid?

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:27.304
Don't you know what I paid
to walk normally like other people?

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.349
Would I be stupid enough
to reconnect with them?

00:14:41.402 --> 00:14:42.987
Since you've found her,

00:14:43.487 --> 00:14:45.239
forget the past.

00:14:46.615 --> 00:14:47.449
Move on.

00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:51.870
Don't let things from the past
that you can't change

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:54.206
ruin your future with her.

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:17.688
Legislator Ouyang announced last week
he'd run in Taichung's mayoral primary.

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:20.899
He seems to have recovered
from his son's alleged drug involvement.

00:15:20.983 --> 00:15:24.903
Although his son wasn't prosecuted
in the end due to insufficient evidence,

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:28.240
the drug case still cost
Ouyang Hsiang the election.

00:15:28.323 --> 00:15:31.118
He brought his youngest son,
who just started middle school,

00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:32.786
to canvass the streets with him today.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.456
The first stop was
in Wu Ching-ming's electoral district.

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:39.168
Since Wu declared his intention
to run in the primary just a few days ago…

00:15:39.251 --> 00:15:41.420
What's with you
and news about that old man?

00:15:41.503 --> 00:15:44.214
…to dissuade Wu Ching-ming
and consolidate the party…

00:15:44.298 --> 00:15:45.299
Nothing.

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:48.260
It just happened to be on TV.

00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:52.306
Do you also think

00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:54.725
we've ended up like this

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.185
because of me?

00:15:57.686 --> 00:15:58.645
No.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.440
I never thought of it that way.

00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:04.151
Stop lying.

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.863
Did it never occur to you

00:16:09.406 --> 00:16:12.284
that the bitch who threw herself at him

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:15.287
couldn't have replaced you

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.539
if it weren't for your disgraceful son?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.213
I've never thought of it that way.

00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:42.147
What's up?

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:55.452
I see.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.164
Right.

00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:00.457
Okay.

00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:02.501
-I see.
-I got bentos.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.336
Okay.

00:17:04.962 --> 00:17:08.340
So you haven't kept in touch
with Hsiao-tung?

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:11.635
Then

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:15.973
do you know why Hsiao-tung
transferred to a school in Taipei?

00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:17.850
I see.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.602
Okay. All right, thank you.

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:22.146
Okay. Bye.

00:17:23.438 --> 00:17:25.941
Why have you started looking for
your good friend again recently?

00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:29.528
I remember you looked for her
for a while a few years ago,

00:17:30.028 --> 00:17:31.697
then you gave up, didn't you?

00:17:34.908 --> 00:17:38.078
Back then, she disappeared without a word.

00:17:40.038 --> 00:17:42.291
She moved and changed her cell number.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.169
I tried everything
and still couldn't find her.

00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:48.297
Later on,

00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:50.340
I was too scared to look for her.

00:17:51.133 --> 00:17:51.967
Why?

00:17:55.095 --> 00:17:57.764
Maybe I was afraid
she really didn't want me as a friend.

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:00.142
All these years,

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:01.977
even while I was in the UK,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.605
I was afraid to change
my email and cell number

00:18:05.355 --> 00:18:06.940
because I was waiting

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:09.735
for a day when she might think of me…

00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:12.821
and want to reconnect.

00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:18.869
But when I was in Taichung this time,
I met a high school classmate.

00:18:22.247 --> 00:18:23.165
He…

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:27.669
he said Hsiao-tung committed suicide.

00:18:27.753 --> 00:18:28.879
Suicide?

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:30.797
I don't know.

00:18:31.298 --> 00:18:32.799
I don't believe it either.

00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:37.179
But no one has seen
Hsiao-tung all these years.

00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:41.725
She moved and transferred schools.

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.646
Maybe something did happen.

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:52.069
But if that's why she couldn't contact me…

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:56.490
then I really can't forgive myself.

00:18:58.158 --> 00:18:59.785
Hi, everyone.

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:01.453
I'm Lisa, and this is Mimi.

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:03.247
We are Lisa Mimi.

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.500
Check out my new favorite lip gloss.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.460
Everyone, this is

00:19:08.543 --> 00:19:10.796
Bobo Seamless Kissie…

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:13.715
This… is

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:16.927
Bobo Perfect Seamless Kissie…

00:19:17.719 --> 00:19:20.931
Fuck! Why the hell
is the name so fucking long? Damn it.

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:24.309
Such a fucking bad product.

00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:26.353
And I can't get a single word wrong.

00:19:26.853 --> 00:19:29.273
Shitty company. Stingy as hell.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:30.774
This is too gluey!

00:19:31.358 --> 00:19:32.401
Super annoying!

00:19:32.484 --> 00:19:34.361
If only I weren't short on cash now.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.282
Only 100,000 NTD, and they want all that?

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:39.241
Hey.

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:42.244
I market myself as
a cultured, elegant, ethereal goddess.

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:44.371
I have hundreds
of thousands of subscribers.

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:47.416
They wanted me,
but didn't bother to check my rates?

00:19:52.629 --> 00:19:54.548
Could you not smoke here?

00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:56.967
I don't really like secondhand smoke.

00:19:58.468 --> 00:19:59.511
What now?

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:01.722
Idiot.

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.145
Hello?

00:20:09.938 --> 00:20:10.856
Tsai Wen-ling.

00:20:11.356 --> 00:20:12.399
What's this about?

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.485
A class reunion?

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:24.911
-This is from the same store?
-Yes.

00:20:24.995 --> 00:20:25.912
No.

00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:27.831
It's a bit hard.

00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.584
Yes, I think so too.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.586
-That's great.
-Hey, how's your drink?

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:35.839
Sorry. Excuse me, I'm late.

00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:38.800
-It's okay.
-The cameraman was so slow just now.

00:20:38.884 --> 00:20:41.428
Hey, we're all subscribed.
You're so popular now.

00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:42.387
-Really?
-Yes.

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.722
-Thanks.
-You're so pretty.

00:20:43.805 --> 00:20:45.307
-Thank you.
-You're great.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.892
-I'm so jealous of you.
-Nah.

00:20:48.268 --> 00:20:51.188
-We've ordered. Pick whatever you like.
-Okay, thanks.

00:20:51.271 --> 00:20:53.690
Have you all received a call from a girl

00:20:53.774 --> 00:20:55.525
asking about Hsiao-tung recently?

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:57.319
Yes, I have.

00:20:57.402 --> 00:20:59.696
She asked if I knew
who still talks to Hsiao-tung.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.657
I just said,
"I haven't heard. I don't know."

00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:03.658
Who's that girl?

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:05.410
Lai Yun-chen.

00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:08.705
I forgot which class she was in,
but she was close to Hsiao-tung.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:12.209
She changed schools before Hsiao-tung,
so she didn't know what happened later.

00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:14.169
I was afraid to tell her.

00:21:14.252 --> 00:21:16.922
I said I don't know, or I'm not in touch.

00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:19.925
Right, she's Hsiao-tung's friend,
and even she doesn't know.

00:21:20.008 --> 00:21:21.718
I couldn't say it either.

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:24.388
So do any of you still talk to Hsiao-tung?

00:21:24.471 --> 00:21:26.098
Didn't she commit suicide?

00:21:26.181 --> 00:21:28.266
Is that true? Why does everyone say that?

00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:35.023
I think it's because of that.

00:21:36.441 --> 00:21:39.277
Wasn't Hsiao-tung filmed?

00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:42.864
After she transferred schools,
some boys shared the videos.

00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:46.701
Then someone said they saw her
being sent to a hospital in Taipei.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:49.162
She was all bloody,
like there was no hope for her.

00:21:49.246 --> 00:21:51.415
-Yes, I remember it was like that.
-Yeah.

00:21:51.498 --> 00:21:52.833
Isn't that such a pity?

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:54.793
She was the best dancer in our class,

00:21:55.585 --> 00:21:57.712
but she ended up like this.

00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:15.230
We were all chatting earlier.
I didn't get to talk to you alone.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.442
Actually, I've been watching your videos.

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.194
You look more beautiful in person.

00:22:21.278 --> 00:22:24.030
-You must have a lot of suitors.
-It's all right.

00:22:24.573 --> 00:22:27.993
But if you are comparing me
with those ordinary girls,

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:29.327
of course, I have a lot.

00:22:31.413 --> 00:22:33.248
Your job must pay well.

00:22:33.957 --> 00:22:35.834
Actually, it's not that much.

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:38.128
My channel earns little.
Brand deals are flaky.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:41.047
Besides, I have to pay
my editors and content managers.

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:43.008
They earn more than I do.

00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:44.593
After paying them this month,

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:46.636
I can't even afford a handbag.

00:22:50.849 --> 00:22:52.684
If you need money,

00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:54.311
I can refer you for a job.

00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:56.605
I'm in ad sales now.

00:22:56.688 --> 00:22:58.648
We often work with clients abroad.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:02.068
We have a US client
who's planning to move to Taiwan.

00:23:02.152 --> 00:23:05.322
He's looking for a pretty
and classy girl like you to hang out with.

00:23:06.072 --> 00:23:08.200
-Hang out?
-Actually, it's just having meals.

00:23:08.283 --> 00:23:10.410
And going to attractions
in Taiwan with him.

00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:11.912
Like a companion.

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:13.038
You know, bosses.

00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:16.333
Relationships are too much trouble,
but they don't want to be lonely.

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:20.378
Then how much is it
for each meal and each hangout?

00:23:20.462 --> 00:23:22.964
100,000 NTD for meals.
Not sure about hangouts.

00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:25.467
Maybe you'll have to meet and discuss it.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.551
But don't worry.

00:23:26.635 --> 00:23:29.012
I'll make sure you're happy with the deal.

00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:32.182
But I won't sleep with him.
After all, I'm somewhat known.

00:23:32.265 --> 00:23:33.725
Yes, of course.

00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:35.810
Why don't you meet with him first?

00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:38.438
He said if he's pleased,

00:23:38.522 --> 00:23:39.898
he'll pay you

00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:41.691
a 200,000 NTD deposit at once.

00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:43.443
200,000 NTD just to meet?

00:23:43.527 --> 00:23:45.028
Are you free after we're done?

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:47.948
I can let him know
if you can meet him tonight.

00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:50.825
Sure.

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:51.743
Okay.

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:03.421
My client highly values privacy.

00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:04.673
Don't worry.

00:24:04.756 --> 00:24:07.926
Although I'm not going up with you,
I'll wait for you here.

00:24:08.009 --> 00:24:09.469
Just come to me if anything is off.

00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:11.513
Sure, as long as he pays me.

00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:12.681
Okay.

00:24:17.227 --> 00:24:18.228
Just swipe in.

00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:21.856
Thanks. I'll buy you a meal
after I get the money.

00:24:22.357 --> 00:24:23.316
It's nothing.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.402
You're the one helping me.

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:41.251
You found a replacement so quickly?

00:24:42.168 --> 00:24:43.003
Hey.

00:24:44.504 --> 00:24:45.672
Who is it?

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:50.260
It's okay.

00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:51.970
I'll take a look myself.

00:24:52.053 --> 00:24:53.888
That room was prepared for you anyway.

00:24:53.972 --> 00:24:55.015
It has

00:24:55.515 --> 00:24:56.516
a camera.

00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:03.982
It's an old classmate.

00:25:04.482 --> 00:25:06.109
Is this a class reunion?

00:25:08.153 --> 00:25:09.779
You look like such a good girl.

00:25:09.863 --> 00:25:10.947
I didn't expect this.

00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:16.077
Hey.

00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:17.287
Do you want to watch?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.455
It's heating up.

00:25:19.831 --> 00:25:20.790
Come.

00:25:20.874 --> 00:25:22.208
Come here.

00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:23.877
You can't see if you look down.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.378
Come on.

00:25:25.962 --> 00:25:27.339
Can't face what you've done?

00:25:51.863 --> 00:25:52.906
Tsai Wen-ling.

00:25:52.989 --> 00:25:55.325
You really have been an idiot
since high school.

00:25:55.408 --> 00:25:58.161
You wanted to trick me,
but didn't check who Ouyang is to me?

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.455
Since high school,

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:03.333
Ouyang and I have hooked up
countless times.

00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:06.252
We couldn't be closer.

00:26:08.088 --> 00:26:11.007
In fact, when you were discussing
prices with me,

00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:13.218
I already knew what you were up to.

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:15.804
Earlier downstairs,

00:26:15.887 --> 00:26:18.223
Ouyang and I were laughing at you
in our texts.

00:26:20.725 --> 00:26:21.685
Ouyang.

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:24.729
-Yes.
-Punish that bitch properly for me.

00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:26.439
Oh, give it to me.

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:27.941
Sure.

00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:30.902
What do you want her to do
before you forgive her?

00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:34.447
She wanted to turn me into a porn actress.

00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:36.783
Given my status,

00:26:38.493 --> 00:26:40.370
it's only fair to pay me

00:26:40.453 --> 00:26:42.330
a few million NTD, right?

00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:50.046
Sure. Let me handle this.

00:26:52.173 --> 00:26:53.550
Come on.

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.267
A two-million NTD promissory note.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.351
Sign before you leave.

00:27:04.894 --> 00:27:06.938
I really don't have any money left.

00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.065
I'm sorry. Spare me.

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:11.317
I can't afford that.

00:27:13.778 --> 00:27:15.530
I know you don't have money.

00:27:16.114 --> 00:27:18.783
Aren't your parents civil servants?

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.869
They should have some money, right?

00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:26.833
Don't go to my parents.

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:28.251
They have no part in this.

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:30.962
Spare me.

00:27:32.547 --> 00:27:34.048
I won't go to them, then.

00:27:34.716 --> 00:27:36.718
You come to me, all right?

00:27:38.261 --> 00:27:39.679
Each week,

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.514
I'll only charge you

00:27:42.015 --> 00:27:43.224
3% interest.

00:27:43.308 --> 00:27:44.768
Okay? All right?

00:27:45.894 --> 00:27:46.936
Hang on.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.614
Okay, got it, bye.

00:28:00.658 --> 00:28:01.659
Remember,

00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:05.830
if I don't see the money
by next Wednesday,

00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:08.166
you'll see what happens.

00:28:10.418 --> 00:28:11.252
Come on.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:15.965
You can do it.

00:28:16.466 --> 00:28:18.676
Hey, get the actress to sign.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.470
Then take some promotional shots.

00:28:24.307 --> 00:28:25.225
Fatty!

00:28:25.725 --> 00:28:26.726
What's up?

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.852
What's going on?

00:28:30.814 --> 00:28:32.524
-I just got a call.
-Yeah.

00:28:33.107 --> 00:28:35.568
A few call girls
filed a police report yesterday.

00:28:35.652 --> 00:28:38.196
They testified that Wei-ting drugged them

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.949
and that he was the one
who sold the videos online.

00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:45.829
Let's set a breakpoint first, okay?

00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:47.455
You took the site down?

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:48.790
Yes.

00:28:48.873 --> 00:28:51.084
I also removed
the hard drives in the office.

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:53.169
What are your plans for the warehouse?

00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:56.631
I already asked someone to move
all the goods to a different place.

00:28:56.714 --> 00:28:57.715
It should be fine.

00:28:59.676 --> 00:29:01.469
Great job, then, fatty!

00:29:02.387 --> 00:29:03.930
You don't need to worry.

00:29:04.013 --> 00:29:05.598
There is no evidence.

00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:07.684
The police can't do anything about us.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.394
No.

00:29:12.105 --> 00:29:13.565
The problem now isn't the cops.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.359
-Okay.
-It's Kun.

00:29:27.245 --> 00:29:28.746
How's Baldy Kun involved?

00:29:30.248 --> 00:29:33.251
One of the call girls
who filed a report yesterday

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:34.752
is

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:37.505
Kun's chick.

00:29:50.602 --> 00:29:52.520
Didn't I warn you guys earlier

00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:55.356
not to touch that girl?

00:29:55.857 --> 00:29:56.733
Didn't I?

00:29:57.275 --> 00:29:59.444
We never touched her again
after your warning.

00:29:59.527 --> 00:30:03.781
Who knows what got into Fan Wei-ting
that he messed around with her later on?

00:30:06.492 --> 00:30:09.120
Fuck, I'm not his penis!
How could I control him?

00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:25.845
Anyway…

00:30:26.387 --> 00:30:28.848
anyway, Kun's men have spread the word.

00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:33.186
He said if we don't hand Wei-ting over,

00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:35.271
from now on,

00:30:35.772 --> 00:30:36.940
when he sees us,

00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:38.358
he'll shoot first.

00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:42.445
Ouyang, how about…
we ask your dad to handle it?

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:50.620
Find that damn idiot, Fan Wei-ting, first.

00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:53.039
Where is he now?

00:30:53.831 --> 00:30:55.249
I don't know.

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:56.417
His phone is off.

00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:58.378
He's been missing since yesterday.

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:13.893
Fuck!

00:31:22.527 --> 00:31:26.614
Do you think Kun and his men
have already got hold of Fan Wei-ting?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.201
Fuck, if that's the case,

00:31:30.702 --> 00:31:32.328
he's really dead meat.

00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:34.372
I don't fucking care if he's dead or not!

00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:39.502
I'm worried that coward
will sell us all out to cover his ass!

00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:40.503
Okay?

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.881
What matters most now

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.592
is to find him

00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:48.469
before anyone else does.

00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:49.429
Okay?

00:31:50.096 --> 00:31:51.848
Got it?

00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:53.182
Go!

00:32:00.606 --> 00:32:02.734
This lamp seems nice,

00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:05.653
but it might be a bit too short.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.033
Can you help me pick a lamp?

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:12.910
It can have a more unusual shape.

00:32:12.994 --> 00:32:15.580
I want it in the living room.
The old one is broken.

00:32:15.663 --> 00:32:17.790
Will regular ceiling lights work?

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.585
It's not that they won't work.

00:32:21.085 --> 00:32:24.255
It's just that if I wake up
in the middle of the night

00:32:24.338 --> 00:32:27.300
and there are different light sources
to help me orient myself,

00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:28.676
I'll feel more at ease.

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:31.512
That's why you have all kinds of lamps.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.264
Right.

00:32:34.015 --> 00:32:36.350
Come on. Let's check over there.

00:32:36.434 --> 00:32:37.518
Okay.

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.951
Let's celebrate Christmas together.

00:32:54.035 --> 00:32:55.369
How do we celebrate it?

00:32:55.453 --> 00:32:57.288
We'll decorate
the Christmas tree together,

00:32:58.623 --> 00:32:59.999
have a feast,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.375
and exchange gifts.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.882
Does it have to be a lamp?

00:33:09.383 --> 00:33:11.636
What about a Christmas tree with lights?

00:33:12.637 --> 00:33:14.180
Why get a Christmas tree?

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.558
It's a while before Christmas.

00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:23.898
I remember

00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:26.400
when I was in high school,

00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:29.821
I once told someone

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.240
that I had never celebrated Christmas,

00:33:33.658 --> 00:33:36.119
so I didn't know
what to do during Christmas.

00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:40.665
They told me Christmas is spent
with someone special to you,

00:33:40.748 --> 00:33:42.708
decorating the Christmas tree together,

00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:44.669
and exchanging gifts.

00:33:49.423 --> 00:33:51.300
That must be a girl.

00:33:52.802 --> 00:33:56.305
So, in the end,
did she decorate the Christmas tree,

00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:58.099
exchange gifts,

00:33:58.182 --> 00:34:00.601
and celebrate Christmas with you,
her special someone?

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:07.567
No.

00:34:09.277 --> 00:34:10.278
Later on,

00:34:10.778 --> 00:34:12.655
I still didn't get to celebrate Christmas.

00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:18.494
But it's my wish now to celebrate
Christmas with someone special to me.

00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:20.872
It's not Christmas yet.

00:34:20.955 --> 00:34:22.206
However,

00:34:23.624 --> 00:34:25.418
if possible…

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.797
I want my first Christmas to be with you.

00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:38.389
I'm freer these days.

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.308
A few straight days off.

00:34:40.391 --> 00:34:42.143
Is there anywhere you want to go?

00:34:44.353 --> 00:34:45.813
The seaside.

00:34:48.816 --> 00:34:49.734
Sure.

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:53.154
Forget it.

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:56.073
I think we'd need to keep
changing buses to get there.

00:34:56.157 --> 00:34:58.451
It's such a hassle. Forget it.

00:34:58.534 --> 00:35:00.661
It's okay. I'll find a way.

00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:02.914
If you want to go there, let's do it.

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:06.292
Okay.

00:35:09.712 --> 00:35:10.755
Why do you

00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:13.299
suddenly want to go to the seaside?

00:35:15.259 --> 00:35:16.886
I had a dream a few days ago.

00:35:17.386 --> 00:35:19.931
I dreamed that I went
to the seaside with you.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.475
But this dream was unique.

00:35:22.558 --> 00:35:24.143
It wasn't just you and me.

00:35:24.227 --> 00:35:26.854
There was another girl
walking in front of us.

00:35:26.938 --> 00:35:28.231
I don't know why,

00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:30.274
but I felt nostalgic

00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:33.194
looking at her back.

00:35:35.446 --> 00:35:37.907
It's like I've been waiting for her
for a long time.

00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:43.120
I remember calling her name in the dream.

00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:44.622
Her name is…

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:46.374
Yun-chen.

00:35:53.005 --> 00:35:55.299
Yun-chen. Her name is Yun-chen.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.385
But I don't know her at all.

00:35:58.761 --> 00:36:02.265
Maybe that's why I still remember it
after a few days.

00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:25.705
Long time no see.

00:36:25.788 --> 00:36:27.915
Yun-chen, you still look the same.

00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:29.500
You haven't changed much.

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:34.255
I remember you were your class's leader.

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.882
And your family seemed well-off.

00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:39.260
I heard from my classmates

00:36:39.343 --> 00:36:41.345
that your grandma
was a landowner back home.

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:42.263
Is that true?

00:36:42.346 --> 00:36:44.974
You didn't ask to meet
just to discuss my grandma, did you?

00:36:46.225 --> 00:36:47.184
No.

00:36:47.268 --> 00:36:49.603
At our class reunion a while ago,

00:36:49.687 --> 00:36:52.690
I heard from my classmates that
you were asking about Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:36:54.233 --> 00:36:56.652
But you didn't want to tell me anything
over the phone

00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:58.738
and insisted that we meet in person.

00:36:58.821 --> 00:36:59.655
Why?

00:37:02.033 --> 00:37:03.200
Because

00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:06.120
I don't know
where Chiang Hsiao-tung is now.

00:37:07.288 --> 00:37:09.749
But I know what happened to her

00:37:09.832 --> 00:37:11.417
after you transferred schools

00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:14.462
and why she cut contact with everyone.

00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:31.187
It's just that I'm in some trouble now,

00:37:31.687 --> 00:37:32.646
and I need money.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.273
If you lend me two million NTD,

00:37:34.857 --> 00:37:37.068
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:38.736
Are you kidding me?

00:37:40.196 --> 00:37:41.280
Wait.

00:37:42.239 --> 00:37:45.534
Don't you want to know what happened
to your friend Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:48.287
Stop wasting my time.

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:49.955
Let go.

00:37:53.667 --> 00:37:54.752
Leave if you want.

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:56.003
When you get home,

00:37:56.087 --> 00:37:58.506
look up a few keywords if you have time.

00:38:01.926 --> 00:38:03.302
"Yi-no High School,"

00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:04.720
"leaked video,"

00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:06.847
and "gang rape."

00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:14.647
If you want to know more details,

00:38:15.147 --> 00:38:17.191
as long as you lend me two million NTD,

00:38:17.274 --> 00:38:19.318
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:23.322
I guarantee you,
no one else in the world will tell you

00:38:23.406 --> 00:38:25.199
what exactly happened to Hsiao-tung.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.829
Mr. Li, the transfer is done.

00:38:29.912 --> 00:38:31.580
Here are the documents and keys.

00:38:31.664 --> 00:38:32.790
They are yours now.

00:38:35.376 --> 00:38:36.377
Thank you.

00:38:48.931 --> 00:38:50.933
Are you taking me to the seaside?

00:38:51.016 --> 00:38:52.351
It's such a hassle.

00:38:53.144 --> 00:38:54.019
From now on,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.815
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

00:39:59.543 --> 00:40:01.962
Give me 100,000 NTD first.

00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:05.132
That's not a problem, of course.

00:40:05.216 --> 00:40:07.301
You'll enjoy it so much
that you won't be able to work.

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:16.769
Li Jen-yao, your girl's a good bang.
Have you boned her before?

00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:18.938
We're brothers if you have.

00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:24.693
Fucking moron.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.224
Call ended.

00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:50.506
I thought

00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:53.676
whoever was following me was probably
a police officer or Kun's man.

00:42:54.718 --> 00:42:57.971
I didn't expect it to be you,
a fucking mad dog.

00:43:07.439 --> 00:43:08.816
I even wondered

00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:11.944
if I should ask
why you were following me for no reason

00:43:12.027 --> 00:43:13.487
and let you explain.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.990
But look at your damn face.
It's fucking pointless to ask.

00:43:20.244 --> 00:43:21.870
I really don't get it.

00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:25.541
That was fucking centuries ago, you…

00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:27.167
You're that mad?

00:43:31.463 --> 00:43:33.799
We just fooled around
and fucked your girl.

00:43:33.882 --> 00:43:36.009
Was it that big a deal?

00:43:36.093 --> 00:43:38.512
Do you have to back everyone into a corner
like that?

00:43:38.595 --> 00:43:40.431
Do you?

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:44.893
Well…

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.316
I apologize.

00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:54.528
We were wrong.

00:43:54.611 --> 00:43:56.321
I'm sorry, okay?

00:44:06.165 --> 00:44:08.459
I fucked your girl and made you upset.

00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:10.753
It's my fault.

00:44:10.836 --> 00:44:12.212
I'll let you fuck me.

00:44:13.797 --> 00:44:15.632
Fuck me till you're satisfied, go ahead.

00:44:16.717 --> 00:44:19.178
We'll both have fun
and call it even then, okay?

00:44:21.847 --> 00:44:22.890
Come on.

00:44:35.444 --> 00:44:36.945
Or do you want me to fuck you?

00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:41.658
I can do you too.

00:44:42.534 --> 00:44:43.619
I fuck really well.

00:44:45.078 --> 00:44:46.955
Ask Hsiao-tung if you're not convinced.

00:44:54.505 --> 00:44:57.341
Many people fucked her that day,
but she had the most fun with me.

00:44:58.884 --> 00:45:00.677
She screamed so loudly.

00:45:01.512 --> 00:45:02.638
When it was my turn,

00:45:02.721 --> 00:45:04.139
she was a bit loose already.

00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:06.934
But it was fine, I was good.
You saw it then, right?

00:45:07.017 --> 00:45:08.769
She still loved it when I fucked her,

00:45:09.353 --> 00:45:12.981
so much so that, even though she said no,
her whole body was shaking!

00:45:24.243 --> 00:45:25.869
Fuck! What the hell?

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:38.507
I'm sorry.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:40.467
I'm sorry.

00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:42.803
I'm sorry.

00:54:31.247 --> 00:54:36.252
