kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.257
Nice.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:38.560
Hey.

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:41.104
Boy.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.439
Smile.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:46.943
Smile.

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.003
Jen-yao.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:51.883
Mom and Dad won't leave you anymore.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.719
This time, no matter where I go,

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:56.679
I'll bring you along for sure.

00:01:57.847 --> 00:02:01.059
We can finally be together again
as a family.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.024
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:28.122
What do you think?

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:29.665
Did you have fun?

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:38.883
I'm serious.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.635
If I were you,

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.970
I'd run as far away as I could.

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:44.722
It's best if you never come back.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:49.644
Otherwise,

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.355
I'll give you a shot

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:54.899
every time I see you,

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:55.983
just like a doctor.

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:57.902
One shot at a time,

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:00.279
until you're pleased.

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:02.156
Sounds good?

00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:37.024
Dinner's in the kitchen.

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:39.485
Make yourself a plate.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:51.080
Yun-chen.

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:54.584
Remember, when you're done eating,
make a pot of tea for me.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.921
Okay.

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:00.715
I'll do it right now.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.483
Grandma.

00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:06.781
Grandma.

00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:15.915
PASSBOOK

00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.519
Yun-chen.

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:02.503
I know you.

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.797
Really.

00:08:05.506 --> 00:08:07.883
I know you better than anyone else does.

00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:10.011
I know,

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.763
day after day,

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:15.891
you feel like you can't take it anymore.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:18.561
You can't stand
living with me in this house.

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:21.981
It feels miserable
and unbearable to you, doesn't it?

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.900
You're wrong!

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:28.738
In this house,

00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:34.535
you were never the one
who suffered the most.

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:36.287
It's me.

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:38.706
It's me!

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:41.459
The night Tao-ming left,

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.961
I promised him
that I'd take good care of you.

00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.632
But the older you get,

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:50.760
the more you look like that woman!

00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:57.475
Whether it's your voice,

00:08:57.558 --> 00:08:58.893
your facial expression,

00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:03.022
or the way you look at me…

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:06.984
it's exactly like hers.

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:10.196
Every time I look at you,

00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:12.990
I'd recall…

00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.995
that she took everything from me.

00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.875
Why must I raise the kid of a murderer?

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:26.879
Why must I let you live and torture me?

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.673
Stop talking.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:30.925
I hate you so much.

00:09:33.427 --> 00:09:34.470
But…

00:09:37.056 --> 00:09:39.767
I must pretend that I love you.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.352
Stop talking.

00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:43.479
You think

00:09:44.814 --> 00:09:46.148
you're the only one

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.360
who wants to get out of here?

00:09:51.112 --> 00:09:52.113
Let me tell you.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:55.866
No one wants to escape this place
more than I do.

00:09:56.951 --> 00:10:00.579
Living with you
makes me the most miserable.

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:02.707
It makes me suffer more than anyone else.

00:10:03.207 --> 00:10:04.750
I beg you! Shut up!

00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:06.210
Stop talking!

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:13.342
Okay.

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:15.803
Yun-chen.

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:17.763
I…

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:20.474
I beg you.

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:24.061
You're my only family now.

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:28.023
Don't leave me, okay?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.736
Don't be like Tao-ming,

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.362
who left me all alone.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:36.407
I know you really detest me.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.825
You hate me.

00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:39.285
But please,

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.579
you're my only family.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:44.081
Please don't abandon me.

00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:45.833
Promise you'll always…

00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:50.713
always stay with me, okay?

00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:53.299
I beg you.

00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:55.009
-No.
-Yun-chen.

00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:57.303
-Yun-chen.
-No!

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:06.497
Yun-chen.

00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:14.588
Hsiao-tung, I…

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:17.883
I don't know why it turned out this way.

00:12:18.884 --> 00:12:21.303
I really don't know
why it turned out this way.

00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:47.204
To be honest,
my original plan after high school

00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:50.875
was to get out of here
and study in Taipei.

00:12:55.462 --> 00:12:58.841
Who knew my grandma would be
so mad at me for running away…

00:13:00.968 --> 00:13:03.053
that she'd just withdraw me from school,

00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:05.931
saying she'd bring me to the US?

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:10.895
If I don't leave now…

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:17.776
it'll be even harder
to escape her clutches later.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.320
That's why…

00:13:20.112 --> 00:13:22.823
that's why I mixed
sleeping pills with her tea.

00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:28.037
Yun-chen.

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:31.624
Why do you have sleeping pills?

00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:49.308
Truth is, I've been seeing a doctor.

00:13:55.397 --> 00:13:57.650
I've always felt miserable
because of Grandma.

00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:00.527
Since I started middle school,

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:02.363
my condition has become worse.

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:05.240
I can't even get proper sleep.

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:07.576
Hsiao-tung, believe me.

00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:10.996
I really just want to get out of here.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.790
But I don't know…

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:15.292
I don't know why…

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:17.711
I don't know why my hand…

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:21.924
I really don't know why
it turned out this way.

00:14:22.007 --> 00:14:23.926
I really don't know why.

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:25.010
I don't know.

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:26.637
I really don't know.

00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.015
It's okay.

00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:32.476
Everything will be fine.

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:45.030
Hey, kid.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.159
I think this motorbike
is worth 12,000 NTD at most.

00:14:49.243 --> 00:14:51.328
-What do you think?
-Can't you make it more?

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:53.747
I can't. I need to make a living too.

00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:54.999
How about this?

00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:58.377
You can consign this motorbike to me.
See if the price will go up.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.545
Does that sound good?

00:15:01.714 --> 00:15:03.757
It's fine. 12,000 NTD it is.

00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:07.261
Okay, wait a moment, then.
I'll get the contract.

00:15:10.764 --> 00:15:13.392
The bus to Taipei is about to leave.

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.895
Passengers going to Taipei,
please board now.

00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:36.623
Shall we sit there?

00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.763
Wait. I'll buy tickets.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.524
Excuse me.

00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:05.027
I'd like two tickets for the next bus.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.528
Both are student tickets.

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.072
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:11.825
How much will that cost?

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:13.535
That will be 750 NTD.

00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:15.454
750 NTD.

00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:18.540
Thank you.

00:16:18.624 --> 00:16:21.001
CALL FROM GRANDMA

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:33.597
Are you really not going to answer it?

00:16:34.223 --> 00:16:35.265
There's no need.

00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:41.105
If she can still call me
and text me asking me to come home,

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.065
she should be okay.

00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:48.445
All right.

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:50.197
Don't think too much for now.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.907
It's the weekend.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.450
Let's treat this as a trip.

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:54.910
I got the tickets.

00:16:57.579 --> 00:16:59.164
Where are we going?

00:17:00.207 --> 00:17:04.086
Since you said you were fine anywhere
as long as we could leave quickly,

00:17:04.169 --> 00:17:07.673
and because I had nothing in mind,
I bought tickets for the next bus.

00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:10.300
To Kaohsiung.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.188
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:17:23.272 --> 00:17:26.150
What's that flying over there?

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:27.651
Is it a butterfly?

00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:36.243
TAIPEI STATION

00:17:44.126 --> 00:17:45.669
Although it looks like one,

00:17:45.752 --> 00:17:47.296
it's not a butterfly.

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:48.463
It's a moth.

00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:53.468
Right.

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:54.970
It's nighttime now.

00:17:55.804 --> 00:17:57.097
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:00.142
Have you ever wondered
why we can only see moths at night

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:01.518
and not butterflies?

00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:06.315
Because moths are nocturnal insects.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.943
They navigate using the moon.

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:14.489
But modern lights are closer to them
than the moon.

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:18.452
So they mistake lights for the moon

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:21.163
and keep flying towards lights.

00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:25.542
They think that as long as
they keep flying towards a light,

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.753
they can get out of here

00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:30.464
and reach somewhere farther away.

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.592
Yet they don't know

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:36.345
that no matter how hard they try,

00:18:37.638 --> 00:18:39.389
they're just going in circles

00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:41.266
and can never get out.

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:50.359
Butterflies are different.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.612
They only appear in the sun.

00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:56.823
To get where they want to go,

00:18:57.824 --> 00:19:00.285
they always dance in the wind.

00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:04.498
One only dances in the sun,

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:09.336
while the other has never seen the sun.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.384
So no matter how much they look alike,

00:19:15.926 --> 00:19:17.386
you'll never mistake them.

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:22.015
Because butterflies and moths

00:19:23.058 --> 00:19:26.770
can never appear
in the same place at the same time.

00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:56.300
Who says a moth can't be with a butterfly?

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:58.969
Look.

00:20:00.012 --> 00:20:01.555
Aren't they together now?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.084
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:22:36.585 --> 00:22:37.419
Why are you…

00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:40.422
Why are you here?

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.806
YUNGHE SOY MILK,
BREAKFAST, LATE-NIGHT SNACKS

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:01.902
Why did you guys come to Taipei?

00:23:05.363 --> 00:23:08.074
I've been feeling a bit stressed lately
due to dance practice,

00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:10.076
so I invited Yun-chen to go on a getaway.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.287
We were supposed to go to Kaohsiung,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.748
but Yun-chen said
she'd never been to Taipei,

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.708
so we decided to come to Taipei.

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:22.631
You go first.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.217
Thank you.

00:23:31.598 --> 00:23:32.432
What about you?

00:23:32.516 --> 00:23:33.808
Why are you in Taipei?

00:23:42.776 --> 00:23:43.735
Now…

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:45.278
now that he can't pay it back,

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.906
my mom has rushed to pack up

00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:49.533
and run off with that scumbag.

00:23:55.247 --> 00:23:56.998
You're not running away, are you?

00:24:04.673 --> 00:24:06.675
Yeah. You could say that.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.678
Anyway, I can't go home now,

00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:11.346
and I don't know where to go.

00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:13.890
So what are your plans?

00:24:23.233 --> 00:24:24.067
I don't know.

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:30.949
Goodness.

00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:32.576
What's with the sad faces?

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.411
We rarely hang out. Cheer up, okay?

00:24:34.494 --> 00:24:37.163
Don't overthink today.
Just leave everything to me.

00:24:41.668 --> 00:24:43.086
PHOTO STICKER BOOTH

00:24:43.169 --> 00:24:44.504
-This one.
-Okay.

00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:46.756
-Which one do you want?
-This. Are you ready?

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:50.885
Let's switch spots.

00:25:00.228 --> 00:25:01.479
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:25:01.563 --> 00:25:03.523
Li Jen-yao, come and take a photo.

00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:07.485
Hurry. Come inside.

00:25:07.569 --> 00:25:09.112
Hurry!

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:12.073
Which one should we choose?

00:25:12.157 --> 00:25:13.283
Let's go with this.

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:14.409
Are you ready?

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:16.453
One, two, three.

00:25:24.002 --> 00:25:25.045
This is for you.

00:25:40.393 --> 00:25:41.603
Lai Yun-chen.

00:25:41.686 --> 00:25:43.146
Why did you run away?

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.440
And you refused to take another one.

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:48.109
We could've had a photo
of all three of us. What a shame.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:53.031
Since we're in Taipei,
where else do you wanna go?

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:55.825
Shilin Night Market or Gongguan?

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:00.121
Can we go to the seaside?

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:01.539
Lai Yun-chen.

00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:04.209
Who comes here for the sea?
Haven't you seen enough in Taichung?

00:26:07.712 --> 00:26:08.672
I've never seen it.

00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:10.632
You've never seen the sea?

00:26:10.715 --> 00:26:12.425
How can that be? What about as a kid?

00:26:16.262 --> 00:26:19.265
Well, you know how strict my family is.

00:26:20.392 --> 00:26:22.727
My grandma doesn't like me roaming around.

00:26:23.978 --> 00:26:26.356
And when she goes out,
she hardly ever brings me along.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.774
So…

00:26:30.944 --> 00:26:32.237
It's fine.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.446
Forget I said that.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.868
Okay. Let's go see the sea.

00:26:38.952 --> 00:26:41.037
If that's what you want, we'll do it.

00:26:52.382 --> 00:26:54.175
-Hsiao-tung.
-Yes?

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:56.261
Where do you want to study
after graduation?

00:27:00.724 --> 00:27:04.227
The teacher kept suggesting
that I try schools abroad.

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:07.230
But we're not some rich family.

00:27:07.313 --> 00:27:08.398
More importantly,

00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:10.984
I don't want to rely on my parents
to pay for school.

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:13.987
So I'll probably try
to get into a school in Taipei.

00:27:15.822 --> 00:27:19.325
Also, many of the dance troupes I like
are based in Taipei.

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:23.329
If I can get into a school in Taipei,
maybe I can audition for them.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.749
You really like dancing.

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:29.419
Do you want to become
a professional dancer in the future?

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.755
In the future?

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.090
I don't know either.

00:27:35.717 --> 00:27:39.679
But I started ballet at five
and have been doing it ever since.

00:27:39.763 --> 00:27:41.848
Dancing feels like a part of me now.

00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:44.476
If I don't dance,

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.227
I'm not sure what else I can do.

00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.062
I'm not like you.

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:50.857
You have good grades and excel in school.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.317
I only know how to dance.

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:54.778
But I've thought about it.

00:27:55.278 --> 00:27:58.990
If I can join
the world's best dance troupe

00:27:59.073 --> 00:28:01.117
and perform for everyone,

00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:02.410
that's pretty good too.

00:28:04.746 --> 00:28:05.622
You can do it.

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:11.085
What about you?

00:28:11.795 --> 00:28:13.046
What do you want to do?

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:18.134
Never thought about it.

00:28:20.094 --> 00:28:22.680
My grandma has always planned my future.

00:28:24.474 --> 00:28:26.476
She doesn't let me have a say either.

00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:30.396
Since I was little,

00:28:30.897 --> 00:28:33.483
whenever I had to write
an essay on My Future,

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:36.569
my mind would go blank.

00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:40.615
The only thing I could think of was…

00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:46.913
"I wish I could leave that house."

00:29:03.888 --> 00:29:04.889
It's the sea.

00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:09.894
That's right.

00:29:10.436 --> 00:29:11.980
It's so blue and beautiful, isn't it?

00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:14.941
It's even more gorgeous up close.

00:29:15.692 --> 00:29:16.526
Come on.

00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:17.944
Li Jen-yao!

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.246
Quick, come here! Hurry!

00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:33.585
Wait!

00:29:33.668 --> 00:29:36.671
Lai Yun-chen, hurry! You're the one
who wanted to come to the seaside.

00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:38.047
Hurry.

00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:44.762
You try.

00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:45.680
Like this.

00:29:47.098 --> 00:29:48.057
Lift it.

00:29:48.558 --> 00:29:49.642
How do I lift it?

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:50.727
One more time.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.103
Up.

00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:36.689
Hey, Li Jen-yao!

00:30:36.773 --> 00:30:37.815
Hurry!

00:30:58.461 --> 00:30:59.587
Go into the sea!

00:31:04.592 --> 00:31:06.135
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:26.531
Let's come here again, okay?

00:31:33.788 --> 00:31:34.789
I'm serious.

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:39.043
The three of us
have to come here again next time.

00:31:46.676 --> 00:31:47.677
Sure.

00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:51.347
Next time.

00:31:52.765 --> 00:31:54.809
The three of us will come here again.

00:31:58.312 --> 00:32:00.356
Sure, we'll come earlier next time.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.941
It's a deal, then.

00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:03.484
No take-backs!

00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:23.004
Here. One each. Take this.

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:24.714
Thank you.

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:29.302
What's our plan for tonight in Taipei?
Where are we staying?

00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:39.812
Hsiao-tung.

00:32:40.897 --> 00:32:42.982
Go home. You don't need to stay with me.

00:32:44.025 --> 00:32:45.526
What will you do if I go home?

00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:54.327
I don't plan on going back
after escaping that house.

00:32:56.329 --> 00:32:57.288
I can't anyway.

00:33:00.666 --> 00:33:01.876
If I go back,

00:33:02.585 --> 00:33:03.920
my grandma won't spare me.

00:33:07.924 --> 00:33:10.802
Should I talk to my parents?
If they know how she treats you--

00:33:10.885 --> 00:33:12.095
I know where I'm going.

00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:18.059
Or I should say,

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.394
I knew where I wanted to go

00:33:21.854 --> 00:33:23.648
from the moment I escaped.

00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:26.651
I've always wanted to find out…

00:33:30.363 --> 00:33:31.823
the answer to one thing.

00:34:12.488 --> 00:34:14.198
I'm sorry. We sell alcohol here.

00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:15.283
No students allowed.

00:34:19.912 --> 00:34:21.247
Don't you remember me?

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.418
I…

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.796
I'm Lai Yun-chen.

00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:30.423
I am--

00:34:38.848 --> 00:34:41.559
Why did you leave me all alone there?

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:44.770
Why didn't you come find me?

00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.149
I'm sorry.

00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:51.152
Do you know…

00:34:51.736 --> 00:34:52.904
do you know

00:34:53.738 --> 00:34:55.573
how much I've missed you?

00:34:56.782 --> 00:34:57.867
I'm sorry.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.268
Are you okay?

00:35:25.895 --> 00:35:28.648
I'm fine. Why do you ask?

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:32.818
Lai Yun-chen is back with her mom.

00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:34.862
You probably won't see each other much.

00:35:36.822 --> 00:35:38.491
Aren't you bummed?

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:50.294
What Yun-chen wants is

00:35:50.795 --> 00:35:52.296
to stay with her mom.

00:35:53.381 --> 00:35:55.299
I couldn't be happier for her.

00:35:56.217 --> 00:35:57.635
Why would I feel sad?

00:36:10.314 --> 00:36:12.066
It's actually quite simple.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.527
Even though I'll miss her

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.446
and feel very lonely
without her by my side,

00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:19.782
I want her to be happy above all.

00:36:20.449 --> 00:36:22.410
I don't want to see Yun-chen cry anymore.

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:24.954
She's my best friend,

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:27.498
so I hope she can be happy.

00:36:31.627 --> 00:36:32.712
And you're wrong.

00:36:33.462 --> 00:36:35.881
Who says Yun-chen and I can't meet often?

00:36:35.965 --> 00:36:37.717
When I get into a school in Taipei,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.678
we'll be able to see each other every day,
just like before.

00:36:42.138 --> 00:36:44.807
That's why I must work harder
and dance better.

00:36:52.315 --> 00:36:53.357
Perfect timing.

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:48.496
At this moment,

00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:51.040
I suddenly feel

00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:54.752
that maybe my life isn't so bad.

00:37:57.671 --> 00:38:00.549
Maybe I can give it another try.

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:03.177
And this time,

00:38:04.095 --> 00:38:06.055
maybe things will be different.

00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:21.362
You're really not going back with me?

00:38:23.989 --> 00:38:24.990
No.

00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:26.992
I don't want to go back.

00:38:32.164 --> 00:38:34.542
Chiang Hsiao-tung, don't worry about me.

00:38:37.962 --> 00:38:40.047
I was lost before.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.509
I felt a little uneasy
even after I came to Taipei.

00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:48.597
But after today…

00:38:54.812 --> 00:38:55.980
I think…

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.400
I've figured some things out.

00:39:02.027 --> 00:39:04.029
For the first time, I've figured out

00:39:05.781 --> 00:39:07.283
what I want to do in the future.

00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:11.912
So from now on,

00:39:12.413 --> 00:39:14.290
I don't want to go back there.

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:18.210
A place that
even my parents don't want to be

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:21.088
can't possibly be called home.

00:39:23.716 --> 00:39:24.800
So…

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.055
I want to find a job

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.433
and try to stay here.

00:39:34.768 --> 00:39:36.437
And every day from here on out,

00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:39.106
I want…

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.033
to live for myself.

00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:53.829
That's great.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.789
I'm happy for you.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.586
But I'm also going to miss you.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.885
Does this mean
we won't see each other again?

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:19.230
Passengers who wish to board,
please do so now.

00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:20.898
The bus is about to leave.

00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:22.191
I'm boarding the bus.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.867
Our class's end-of-semester show
is at the end of May.

00:40:31.951 --> 00:40:33.744
Will you come if I invite you?

00:40:39.166 --> 00:40:40.334
It's okay.

00:40:41.001 --> 00:40:43.671
With all that's going on,
how can you come to my show?

00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:45.089
I didn't think it through.

00:40:45.172 --> 00:40:46.507
Forget I said that.

00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:50.511
The driver can't wait for me.
I have to go.

00:40:52.346 --> 00:40:53.347
Li Jen-yao.

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:55.307
Bye.

00:41:04.191 --> 00:41:05.693
Do you like Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:41:07.528 --> 00:41:08.529
Coward.

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:12.116
Don't even dare tell her you like her.

00:41:13.993 --> 00:41:15.411
Don't be like me.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.081
By the time I had the courage
to tell her that I liked her,

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:22.585
she had already fallen for someone else.

00:41:27.548 --> 00:41:28.716
Trust me.

00:41:29.842 --> 00:41:31.260
You'll regret it when it happens.

00:41:34.263 --> 00:41:35.431
Chiang Hsiao-tung!

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:38.601
I'll come!

00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:42.146
I'll definitely come to your performance!

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:51.780
Li Jen-yao!

00:41:52.364 --> 00:41:53.490
I'll wait for you.

00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:55.284
You have to come.

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:57.953
Otherwise, I won't talk to you ever again.

00:43:13.237 --> 00:43:15.280
Ms. Chu, excuse me. I have a question.

00:43:16.198 --> 00:43:19.576
Do you know the girl
in the photo with Li Jen-yao?

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:21.203
I don't know them.

00:43:22.162 --> 00:43:23.122
Well,

00:43:23.956 --> 00:43:26.291
it's fine if you don't know the girl.

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:28.669
But wasn't Li Jen-yao in your class?

00:43:28.752 --> 00:43:30.254
I told you, I don't know them!

00:43:32.464 --> 00:43:34.466
I need to prepare for my class.
I have to go.

00:43:35.092 --> 00:43:36.552
Ms. Chu.

00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:37.761
Leave now!

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:39.096
Wait.

00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:41.098
Wasn't he your student?

00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:44.101
Wasn't Li Jen-yao your student?

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:47.563
Damn it.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.065
I… I'm sorry.

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:53.110
Don't blame Ms. Chu.

00:43:53.193 --> 00:43:54.111
What?

00:43:55.362 --> 00:43:57.823
No teacher wants
their students to become criminals.

00:43:58.699 --> 00:44:00.701
When Li Jen-yao was caught,

00:44:00.784 --> 00:44:02.995
reporters bombarded
the school with questions.

00:44:03.078 --> 00:44:04.371
Ms. Chu had a hard time too.

00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:05.664
She was chased constantly.

00:44:10.753 --> 00:44:13.213
Hey, excuse me. Can I ask you something?

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:16.175
Well, back when Li Jen-yao studied here,

00:44:17.009 --> 00:44:19.136
were you already teaching here?

00:44:22.806 --> 00:44:24.850
-Yes.
-Is that so? Good.

00:44:28.312 --> 00:44:29.229
May I ask

00:44:29.313 --> 00:44:32.232
if you know this girl?

00:44:33.442 --> 00:44:34.526
Was she a student here?

00:44:36.612 --> 00:44:38.238
I do know her.

00:44:39.865 --> 00:44:42.534
She was the most outstanding student
in my class back then.

00:44:43.118 --> 00:44:46.163
Her name is Chiang Hsiao-tung.
She danced so well.

00:44:46.246 --> 00:44:49.500
-Chiang Hsiao-tung.
-I still think of her from time to time.

00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:54.379
Then can I ask how I can reach her now?

00:44:54.463 --> 00:44:56.590
I have some questions for her.

00:44:57.174 --> 00:44:58.717
Not that I don't want to help,

00:44:58.801 --> 00:44:59.760
it's just that…

00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:05.307
Well,

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.685
even though the school forbade us
from discussing this in private,

00:45:08.769 --> 00:45:10.354
everyone was saying

00:45:10.437 --> 00:45:12.689
Hsiao-tung suddenly disappeared because

00:45:13.941 --> 00:45:14.900
she

00:45:15.692 --> 00:45:16.693
committed suicide.

00:45:19.613 --> 00:45:20.489
If I were her,

00:45:20.572 --> 00:45:23.659
a young girl with such a bright future
who went through all that,

00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:26.203
I'd probably do the same.

00:45:45.222 --> 00:45:46.056
Pin-yu?

00:45:54.773 --> 00:45:57.401
Why did you come without an umbrella
in such heavy rain?

00:45:58.527 --> 00:46:00.070
I met Chiang Hsiao-tung today.

00:46:06.618 --> 00:46:08.704
She showed me a lot about you guys.

00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:12.040
When you two met,

00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:14.877
your name wasn't Shen Mu, was it?

00:46:18.005 --> 00:46:19.256
It was Lai Yun-chen.

00:46:25.262 --> 00:46:26.179
How…

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.724
how do you…

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.684
Sis.

00:46:31.602 --> 00:46:33.312
Be honest with me.

00:46:33.896 --> 00:46:35.063
Chiang Hsiao-tung…

00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:47.826

00:46:51.622 --> 00:46:52.456
Nice!

00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:56.460
Hurry!

00:46:56.543 --> 00:46:57.544
Film her.

00:46:57.628 --> 00:46:58.587
Get a close-up.

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:02.132
Closer!

00:47:02.215 --> 00:47:03.216
Nice!

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.010
Hurry!

00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:06.720
Take it off!

00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:08.430
Film her face!
