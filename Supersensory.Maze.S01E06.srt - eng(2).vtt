00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.920
I have reviewed the promotional plan

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.760
you made for me.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.120
It's quite good.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.130
I'd like to ask you
to take charge of it.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.600
Really?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.350
That's great; it's my honor.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.070
I will surely complete it.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.070
I heard you are abroad.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.350
Can you make it back on time

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.990
to finalize the plan with the publisher?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.840
Don't worry.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.680
Leave it to me.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.480
(Hello, Mr. Xu.)

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.550
(I am Zhi Fei, an editor.)

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.400
(I will be in charge)

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.180
(of the publishing)

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.640
(of Examples of Criminal Psychology.)

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.660
(Looking forward to it.)

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.710
This is Lu Ran, right?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.920
You know each other?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.360
My schoolmate.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.360
A college schoolmate?

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.710
Sorry, Mr. Xu.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.630
I still remember

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.000
the laboratory explosion incident.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.560
We used to be very good friends.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.590
I often miss him.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.750
Me, too.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.870
I didn't expect

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.870
the brother Lu Ran often mentioned

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.430
to be you.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.000
I didn't expect it either

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.200
that you were schoolmates.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.780
The Mingcheng Scholarship
at Kazen University

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.480
was established by my parents

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.730
in my name.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.240
And Lu Ran

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.630
is the most outstanding

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.470
among them.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.960
We met there.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.800
Another round?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.710
One more round.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.130
We're not in a hurry; take it slow.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.800
Sometimes,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.750
taking it slow won't get results.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.630
You must attack,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.520
even if it costs something.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.910
You're still young.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.560
My father often told me

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.150
that if you're not sure you can win,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.270
don't do it.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.670
If you do it,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.630
you must win.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.310
The original family will have

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.560
some influence on the child.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.750
Are you empathizing with me?

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.000
I am not a psychiatrist.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.270
Then you are profiling me.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.270
Do I look like someone who likes

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.830
to bring work into their personal life?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.760
Do I?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.630
I just feel

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.310
that you seem different

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.510
from the brother

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.460
that Lu Ran often mentioned.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.240
How did Lu Ran see me?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.120
He said you were a good brother.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.720
Maybe it's hard in your country,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.200
but here,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.070
everyone's biological information

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.240
is stored on my company's servers.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.820
If I just swapped

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.220
the information of two people,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.750
no one would notice at all.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.160
The scholarships at this school

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
are all named after you.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.350
Do you think

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.390
we can keep it from others?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.240
What about plastic surgery?

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.670
But

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.510
only one Zhuang Mingcheng

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.120
can live in this world.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.390
Thank you for reminding me,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.910
Lu Ran.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.630
He said that all his achievements

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.190
were thanks to you.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.510
So, I'm curious.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.430
Lu Ran said

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.870
you never visited him.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.720
I did owe Lu Ran

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.800
something.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.760
If I could do it all over again,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.750
I'd want to make it up to him.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.780
(Liu Wanyao)

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.780
(Citizen Personal Fingerprint, Lu Ran)

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.390
Mr. Xu, you may collect Lu Ran's ashes

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.680
within three working days.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.920
This contains the address
and phone number

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.000
of the funeral home.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.720
What about the autopsy report?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.870
You need to ask the police.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.830
The neighbor complained
about Room 1103

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.200
(He Ya)
for having too many flies.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.440
The owner couldn't be reached,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.550
so we were called.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.030
When we came over, we found

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.150
body parts hidden in the freezer
in the living room.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.390
They've been taken back.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.720
What did the M. E. say?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.330
For now, they can only determine

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.380
that it's an adult female.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.030
Any other valuable information?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.960
There's one more strange thing.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.780
Look for yourself when you get there.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.920
Bye.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.750
Anyone here?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.470
I'm here.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.420
The homeowner is called Hu Bo.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.360
About 3 months ago,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.890
he was assigned to the overseas branch.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.080
He brought his wife, Wu Xinxin, along.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.960
The property management said so.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.940
It hasn't been verified.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.650
If it weren't for the power outage,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.390
this corpse

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.040
might not have been discovered.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.320
Xu Jingzhi.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.130
This refrigerator was placed here.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.600
Don't you find it strange?

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.220
This isn't a refrigerator.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.110
It's a freezer.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.150
It should be placed in the kitchen.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.870
Why would it be placed here?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.110
Xu Jingzhi?

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.360
The smell is really strong.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.400
What do you think of the crime scene?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.750
There are almost no traces

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.950
of living here.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.600
Even if the killer cleaned up,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.440
it couldn't be as spotless as it is now.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.770
It'd surely have gathered dust.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.630
Also,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.840
the placement of this freezer

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.680
is suspicious.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.320
Quite a few suspicious points.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.360
But before the time of death

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.480
and the number of victims are confirmed,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.960
it's hard to judge.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.130
Are you thoroughly recovered?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.150
I'll go back and rest.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.780
(Rice cake)

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.120
Cooking is

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.550
a special form of chemistry.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.080
So, in fact, this is still

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.030
his profession.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.910
Maybe it's because he

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.550
no longer takes over
the family business,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.360
he's been more outgoing and cheerful.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.750
Mr. Xu is so interested in me?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.580
You could just ask me directly.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.960
There haven't been

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.320
any murder cases lately?

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.240
Isn't it good to be safe and sound?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.120
He's a regular here.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.080
Officer Xu.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.630
We already know each other.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.390
Alright then.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.790
What's this?

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.540
Let me treat you to rice cakes.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.550
Do you like rice cakes?

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.870
Yes.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.660
I started to eat it since childhood.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.580
The taste from childhood
is unforgettable.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.630
Thank you.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.600
Are these flowers prepared

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.720
for your mother?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.600
Yes, every year at this time.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.670
I remember your parents died
in a plane crash

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.750
on Christmas.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.440
Mr. Xu,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.580
you checked very thoroughly.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.390
But in our family,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.270
we hold memorials on birthdays.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.480
My mother's birthday is coming.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.960
Mr. Xu,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.290
you can look into it again.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.910
I feel like the way
you're looking at me now

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.360
is like you're looking at Lu Ran.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.000
You look so much like Lu Ran.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.210
Seeing you makes me wish even more
that Lu Ran were alive.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.910
Alive above the legal bottom line.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.320
You, too.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.110
Yuan.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.320
My mother is dead.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.270
Don't look at me like that again.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.840
Don't look at me like that again!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.120
You have the same eyes

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.200
as a rapist.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.640
There will be no result

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.590
in a short time.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.920
Let me take you out.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.310
I will surely find the murderer.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.590
I want to know

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.030
why it had to be my mom.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.480
Why?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.720
I don't want a result.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.720
I want the truth.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.000
Why don't you go in?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.110
I just saw Editor Song

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.280
go upstairs.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.720
So many writers in this building.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.200
Today, you found
a fresh blood fingerprint

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.030
under the end table.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.610
The dismembered body
was hidden in the freezer.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.550
The freezer was then placed

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.110
in the living room.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.350
The scene was cleaned spotlessly.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.440
Clearly,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.790
this scene was reserved for us.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.470
You haven't changed that bad habit.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.480
We welcome ideas

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.030
that help solve the case.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.160
But you can't act on your own.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.390
Can you do that?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.110
I'll try my best.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.960
That's not enough.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.310
You must do it.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.580
Why did you become a police officer?

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.920
To explore myself and the truth.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.550
Looks like you should

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.790
take a good look at yourself.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.750
What do you want?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.590
You.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.060
(Beautiful Writer Chen Danling)

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.820
(Please contact me, Lu Youliang)

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.060
(Lu Youliang)

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.240
I thought you wouldn't contact me again

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.210
after the police came
to see me last time.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.860
(500,000 Yuan)

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.070
Quite generous.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.030
Help me look into Xu Yi.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.640
Who has he been meeting with lately?

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.580
What has he been doing?

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.440
My scope of business

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.400
does not include

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.480
marital infidelity.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.030
It has nothing to do with that.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.000
His club

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.830
is not a business he built alone.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.320
When do you need it?

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.480
The sooner, the better.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.010
That public training school

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.360
under your name.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.760
If you have time,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.440
it's best to go and take a look.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.000
What do you mean?

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.340
The supply source of the club.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.390
Mr. Xu,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.750
I need to talk to you.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.000
Is it convenient?

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.390
Of course.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.920
Please sit anywhere you like.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.760
Sure.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.070
Just right.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.200
I have something to give you.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.160
Do these designers nowadays

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.750
even have any taste?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.940
It's the same decoration style

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.300
as your home.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.020
Last time I went to your place,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.980
it startled me.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.350
This is for you.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.720
I asked a friend.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.110
During the year-end evaluation,

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.310
it can earn extra points.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.640
Thank you for saving my life.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.240
I can't accept it.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.520
How about this?

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.960
If it's convenient for you,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.080
deliver it to my workplace.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.150
Okay.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.110
Do you like collecting

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.480
different little toys?

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.480
All made in China?

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.070
It's just a hobby.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.960
I bought them all in Chinatown.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.910
This one.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.400
My favorite when I was a child.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.590
I even skipped class

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.270
just to buy it.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.110
But after buying it,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.660
my parents wanted to take it away.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.880
Yet I was good at hiding it.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.940
(Police)

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.340
(Controlled Personnel, Lu Youliang)

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.420
(Sentence completed,
released on April 12, 2011)

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.380
(Jiang Yongquan)

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.780
(Culprit of the "8·19" trafficking case,
currently at large)

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.750
I am not capable.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.540
But if your father hands
the business over to me,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.640
would I go work

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.480
under Mai Boyuan?

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.310
Don't mention Mai Boyuan to me.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.650
Your club can make money

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.850
through a legitimate business.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.170
I can also give you money.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.160
Why make the business dirty?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.070
If you hadn't lost

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.030
that camera,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.250
would I be this passive now?

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.850
What does it have to do
with the camera?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.030
What did you shoot?

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.250
What could I have shot?

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.960
What could I possibly have shot?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.550
Inside is our lifeline.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.590
That thief

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.880
only stole a worthless camera.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.950
Here's the thing.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.550
I'm going to write a new book next.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.750
It's about the impact

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.200
of genetic inheritance

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.690
on psychological growth.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.000
Would you be willing to continue

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.180
to take charge of my new book?

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.870
Zhi Fei?

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.160
Looking forward to our collaboration.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560
Actually,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960
my designer

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.950
was also amateurish and tasteless.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.830
My home was decorated by my ex-wife.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.480
I didn't put any thought into it at all.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.790
You actually copied

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.310
my ex-wife's idea.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.350
Your field of study is...

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.200
DNA decoding and sequencing.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.790
After my parents passed away,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.830
I took over

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.270
the family business.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.880
But as you can tell,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.750
with my personality,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.280
I'm not suited for those social niceties

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.070
in the company.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.800
Alright.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.440
I'm going to rest.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.640
Mr. Xu, take care.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.910
Good night.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.590
I'll take the trash out for you.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.240
Thank you.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.220
(Jing)

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.000
Yi.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.070
- Where is Mr. Hou?
- Mr. Hou?

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.030
He just left.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.000
Left?

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.000
Hello,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.240
Hou.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.030
Why did you leave
without saying anything?

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.160
I just came over.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160
You look too busy.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.680
How's the ledger?

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720
How's the ledger?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.350
I've looked

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.440
everywhere I should.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.350
Still no luck.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.200
But Hu Bo's matter

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.580
needs to be resolved asap.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.480
If someone else gets the ledger,

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.830
neither of us

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.670
will end up well.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.650
There are also negatives.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.830
How did you know about this?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.550
That person
investigated faster than you.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.070
Any new findings on the carpet?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440
Blood sedimentation.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.640
After the tech dpt. cut open the carpet,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.480
they discovered it.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.880
It's been taken back for testing.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.350
Also, the identity of the victim

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.200
was almost confirmed.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480
Her face is complete.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.680
It should be Wu Xinxin.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.480
The body has been decomposed,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.030
but there are no missing parts.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.720
Except for cutting marks,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.720
there are very violent injuries

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.720
caused before death

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.000
in the chest, head, and neck.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.350
Maybe the cause of death is one of them.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.920
There's detergent residue.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.200
It shouldn't have been long.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.670
Liu Ming,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.380
check the surveillance
on the 11th floor.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.460
See who has entered this room
within the past week.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.320
Okay.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.720
Captain He,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.670
we found this.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.560
Flashlight.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.350
There is a second victim.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.480
The victim, Wu Xinxin,

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.960
(Hu Bo, Wu Xinxin)
is Hu Bo's wife.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.580
5 years of marriage. A housewife.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.050
Her social connections were simple.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.160
As for another victim,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.070
Qin, please explain.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.240
(Crime scene photo)
As for this blood fingerprint,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.510
the bloodstains and fingerprints

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.630
do not belong to the victim.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.560
This blood fingerprint

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.850
was formed less than a week ago.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.570
The owner of the blood is a female.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.920
The large amount of blood

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.030
under the carpet

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.870
also belongs to her.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.740
(Crime scene photo)
We're checking who she is.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.820
Bloodstains on the carpet

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.270
were cleaned with a floor scrubber.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.480
Based on what we were able

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.350
to extract,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.550
the amount of blood loss
was already very large.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.730
We still need further analysis

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.020
before we can draw a conclusion.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.030
The current prime suspect

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.270
is the missing Hu Bo.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.640
He lied to the property management

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.310
that he was assigned overseas

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.960
and had to take his wife with him.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.030
So, he most likely premeditated

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.000
the murder.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.200
Two women and one man.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.400
A love triangle, I guess.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.960
These three people must be connected.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.920
But not necessarily

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.550
in the way we imagine.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.000
Alright.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.150
Let's wait for the info
on the second victim.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.480
We'll follow their relationship.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.550
The fresh blood at the scene

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.830
belongs to Liu Wanyao.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:22.960
She was previously

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.430
a victim of domestic abuse.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.680
Domestic abuse?

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.200
It was ten years ago.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.740
The convicted person was

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.340
her mother, Zhao Chunzhi.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.790
Long-term abuse of children.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.880
Domestic violence.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.320
She also has a history of drug use.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.790
It relapsed after release.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.480
She committed robbery with her boyfriend

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.420
and went back to prison.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.180
(Case Registration Form)

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.780
(Case Acceptance Receipt)
The informant

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.160
is Wu Xinxin's husband.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.780
(Hu Bo)

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.240
Ten years ago,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.270
Wu Xinxin and Hu Bo

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.350
weren't married yet, right?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.270
What was their relationship?

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.590
If it hadn't been

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.830
for registering her household,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.440
I wouldn't have married

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.480
a useless man.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.550
I worked so hard

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.760
to raise her,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.950
and what did she do?

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.320
She sent me to prison.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.960
Whatever happened to her,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.330
or what crime she committed,

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.800
it has nothing to do with me.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.950
Across the street.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400
Do you know Hu Bo?

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.440
Is that her man?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.710
Has Liu Wanyao contacted you recently?

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.760
Contact me?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.880
Why?

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.320
Does Liu Wanyao have

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.160
any close friends?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.910
We met once.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.200
This is Hu Bo's last known whereabouts

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.600
we can trace.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.190
Have you ever seen this man?

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.000
I remember now.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.480
He's quite strange.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.000
He paid half a month's rent

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.540
but left after staying a few days.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.810
Are you sure it was him?

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.230
Do you know where he went?

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.320
When he left, he asked

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.180
how to get to the minibus
to Dingquan County.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.200
Dingquan?

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.690
I have the timetable here.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.320
Here.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.780
(Dingquan Long-distance Bus Station)

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.670
Dingquan.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.030
Liu Wanyao is quite miserable.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.190
Lu Ran and Liu Wanyao's

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.760
original families are quite similar.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.550
I feel like

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.000
you've been thinking about the past.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.110
Lately, I've been thinking

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.680
about the things between us in the past.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.980
Then I must have really failed

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.150
if thinking of me

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.840
makes you look deeply resentful.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.160
Really?

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.550
What a fake smile.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.670
Do you still remember the one

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.920
called Zhuang Mingcheng?

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.880
The rich man

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.630
who almost lost his life from dating?

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.150
Do you think he looks like Lu Ran?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.360
I think you should

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.480
go see a psychologist.

In that school,

some female students can earn

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.400
much more than nurses.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.840
What does it mean?

They've found Hu Bo.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.800
What to do next?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.150
After Zhao Xueli died,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.000
we can force Jiang Yongquan out.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:48.900
Once Hu Bo, who kept the accounts,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.750
and Zhao Xueli,
who managed the ledger, died,

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.440
Jiang Yongquan and his boss behind him

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.630
will suspect each other,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.140
thinking they've obtained the ledger,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.000
and try to silence them.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.920
No matter how deep they hid before,

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.670
they'll jump out to protect themselves.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.920
Jiang Yongquan is just an appetizer.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.150
I will surely let

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.190
the boss behind him

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.960
die at your hands.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.110
