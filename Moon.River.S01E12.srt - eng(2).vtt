00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:09.155
(Moon River)

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:10.485
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.785
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.895
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:17.695
I...

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:21.695
must have caught two.

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:26.635
After all, my first love and I...

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:33.245
ended up married twice.

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:44.825
I...

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.185
I am so sorry.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:55.495
At a time like this,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:57.835
you should not be on your knees.

00:00:58.405 --> 00:00:59.905
You should be holding me.

00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:12.845
Like you will never let go.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.215
The river water must have been freezing.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:50.885
Your life must have been equally cold after that.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:53.125
I am truly sorry.

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:58.965
I lived better than you think, Your Royal Highness.

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.595
I laughed often.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:05.905
And there were times I was so happy I could barely breathe.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.875
I, Park Dal, lived a pretty wonderful life.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:11.575
So when you pity me like this,

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:13.505
what does that make my last five years?

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.145
A life is a life, however short.

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:16.645
No.

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:19.085
It is not pity.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.155
I am just so very sorry.

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:25.925
And please stop speaking to me so formally.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:27.255
It is awkward.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.355
How can I go back to speaking to you so casually?

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.995
Do not treat me like Crown Princess Gang Yeon Wol.

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.165
Treat me like Park Dal.

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:36.865
Just like you always have.

00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:40.435
It is not as if all my memories have returned.

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:42.205
And compared to that hazy past,

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.975
the five years I lived as Park Dal feel so much more real.

00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:48.915
- But... - Besides,

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:52.015
what if someone were to hear you?

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:54.315
We must be careful, for both of us.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.155
Okay?

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.295
You were right beside me,

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:09.595
and I was too foolish not to recognise you.

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:13.335
What right do I have to argue? From now on,

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.235
everything will be as you wish, Dal.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:20.205
But...

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:23.915
I am suddenly curious about something.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.215
Is it Gang Yeon Wol?

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:28.715
Or Park Dal?

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:30.585
Well...

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.985
- What are you... - Come on.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:35.925
I am just asking.

00:03:35.955 --> 00:03:37.195
Which one of us do you like more?

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:40.695
And for the record, you cannot say both.

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.035
I mean, what kind of...

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:52.275
Is it that hard of a question?

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:58.415
What right does a fool like me have to say anything?

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:00.715
I will do as you wish, Dal.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:02.285
Trying to weasel your way out of it?

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.495
I am a fool. What right do I have?

00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:09.195
I will do as you wish, Dal.

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:12.525
Are you okay?

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:17.065
Oh, no. Are you hurt?

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:19.805
Does a fool like me even have the right to be okay?

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:21.735
I will do as you wish, Dal.

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:28.015
You scared me. Gosh.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:34.485
This fool...

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:37.115
is going to do as he pleases just this once.

00:05:24.165 --> 00:05:25.205
Elder!

00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:27.305
Elder!

00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:31.945
What is this?

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.145
When one red string of fate goes awry,

00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:37.415
the others are bound to follow.

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:41.685
It seems that fool still has not given up.

00:05:42.655 --> 00:05:45.555
He does not even realise he is turning into a monster.

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:49.355
Hong Nan of Eunwol Pavilion...

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:54.265
asked me to tell the Head Eunuch she is with Yeon Wol of Gang family.

00:05:57.435 --> 00:05:59.405
Yeon Wol of the Gang family, you say?

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.805
I heard Hong Nan has an older brother.

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:08.515
Is he that runaway eunuch?

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:10.445
How could you know that?

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:18.625
(Life)

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:24.625
I heard The Nameless tattoo themselves with "life."

00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:33.235
Please save me.

00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:35.105
So, Your Highness,

00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:40.445
you must not be swayed by pity or curiosity.

00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:43.845
If his goal was to become the King's in-law,

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:46.845
he should have just killed me back in the Gyesa Year.

00:06:48.585 --> 00:06:49.815
Rather than the Crown Princess,

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.855
it would have been far easier to kill the wife of a grand prince.

00:06:57.055 --> 00:06:58.295
The timing is strange too.

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.895
- You must come with us. - Let go of me!

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:03.535
Considering I was deposed not long after that,

00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:05.935
at my mother's grave that day,

00:07:06.835 --> 00:07:08.775
I must have seen something I should not have.

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:16.275
What in the world is on Mount Gamak?

00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:21.085
Your Highness, it is Yeon Sim.

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:22.685
Come in.

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.025
I found a letter outside your chambers.

00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:41.405
(Chapter 12: The Woman in White)

00:07:41.705 --> 00:07:43.305
Hey! What do you think you are doing, you brutes?

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:47.605
Arrest the traitors who abandoned their posts and fled the palace!

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:49.815
- Let me go, you scoundrel! - Open the door!

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:56.585
- Arrest them! - Yes, sir!

00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:59.455
- Well, I knew this day would come. - My goodness.

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:01.725
- Goodness! - That girl...

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:04.495
Hong Nan!

00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:06.165
Goodness! Hong Nan!

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:14.505
You can try to cover the moon, but do you think you can hide?

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:16.705
Protect them.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.945
For getting you both involved in this,

00:08:55.475 --> 00:08:56.645
I am deeply sorry.

00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:58.445
What are you talking about?

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.345
We are the ones at fault.

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:02.915
- Why are you the one apologising? - That is right.

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:07.225
Do not be silly. I may have been prickly,

00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:11.025
but I was sorry,

00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:13.295
and I was always grateful for you, Hong Nan.

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:19.535
My dear.

00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:21.175
If by some chance...

00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:23.375
there is a next life,

00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:26.505
I hope you will...

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:28.815
still find me one more time.

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:34.345
I will be reborn a rich nobleman,

00:09:36.015 --> 00:09:39.285
and I will give you so much wealth, enough to build a mountain with it.

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:41.255
Promise me...

00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:45.495
to find me one more time.

00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:46.925
Gosh.

00:09:48.835 --> 00:09:50.635
Meet again?

00:09:51.165 --> 00:09:52.835
But if we do happen to meet again,

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:56.035
then I...

00:09:57.235 --> 00:10:00.575
will not raise my voice or lose my temper.

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:02.515
I will treat you right.

00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:18.265
Stop!

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:22.965
Stop.

00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:24.935
Stop the execution!

00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:30.405
- What? - Dal. It is Dal.

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:35.775
Out of my way.

00:10:53.595 --> 00:10:57.035
- Dal. - Father. Mother.

00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:59.305
- Auntie. - Dal.

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:00.435
Is it you?

00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:10.915
By what authority did you sentence these people to death?

00:11:11.185 --> 00:11:12.985
They are the fugitive Senior Court Lady and Eunuch.

00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:14.785
And her crime is hiding the fugitives.

00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:16.355
Well,

00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:19.355
they are my family.

00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:21.525
I will explain it all to His Majesty,

00:11:21.525 --> 00:11:22.555
so please stop the execution.

00:11:22.695 --> 00:11:24.095
That is not the answer.

00:11:26.295 --> 00:11:28.495
Reveal your true identity.

00:11:38.445 --> 00:11:39.845
If I answer that question,

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:43.575
Dal!

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.245
will you let them go?

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.555
What do you mean her true identity?

00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:57.395
She is Park Dal!

00:11:58.125 --> 00:11:59.925
You are and always will be...

00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:04.665
- Park Dal! - Right! We were on borrowed time.

00:12:05.035 --> 00:12:07.665
Five years felt like a dream, and that was enough for us.

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:09.535
Dal.

00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:12.905
Dal.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.115
Having you with me...

00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:26.125
was the greatest gift, my daughter.

00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:29.925
I feel the same way.

00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:32.325
Our daughter.

00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:34.965
Do not cry.

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:36.895
Okay?

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:47.945
Carry out the execution!

00:13:07.425 --> 00:13:08.565
Stop!

00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:15.805
I am...

00:13:21.105 --> 00:13:22.675
I am the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

00:13:26.685 --> 00:13:27.685
The Deposed Crown Princess?

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:29.355
The Deposed...

00:13:30.015 --> 00:13:31.115
The Deposed Crown Princess. Yes, it is her.

00:13:31.385 --> 00:13:33.025
Dal!

00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:41.665
What did you just say?

00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:55.415
- No! It is not true! - No!

00:13:55.475 --> 00:13:59.285
- Dal, no! - Dal, why are you doing this?

00:13:59.815 --> 00:14:01.145
Dal!

00:14:01.685 --> 00:14:03.785
- Dal! - Dal!

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.525
Did you not hear me?

00:14:08.355 --> 00:14:09.795
I am the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:24.635
Gang Yeon Wol.

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:31.245
Now that you have the answer you wanted,

00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:33.985
arrest me.

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:36.915
Stop the execution.

00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:40.925
Arrest the criminal, the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:43.925
- Yes, sir! Arrest her! - Yes, sir!

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.095
No!

00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:49.165
- Dal. - No...

00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:53.435
- Dal! - No! What are you doing?

00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:58.505
- No. Dal. - No!

00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:01.545
- No! Dal! - Dal!

00:15:01.645 --> 00:15:04.375
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:09.055
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

00:15:55.835 --> 00:15:59.705
Your Majesty! The Deposed Crown Princess was to die.

00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:01.735
For her to be alive is an act of high treason.

00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:04.275
The Deposed Crown Princess disrespected the Royal Family.

00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:06.775
I implore you to order her execution!

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.145
- Order her execution! - Order her execution!

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:13.585
She dared to hide her identity and enter the palace,

00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:16.515
bringing contempt upon the Royal Family.

00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:19.985
I implore you to order her execution!

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:22.895
- Order her execution! - Order her execution!

00:16:22.955 --> 00:16:25.695
You, of all people, know that Dal is innocent.

00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:27.995
Please help her.

00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:31.165
There is no way to prove the Crown Princess's innocence.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:34.435
Not unless the person who truly killed the Queen confesses.

00:16:35.135 --> 00:16:37.575
In the end, nothing has changed from five years ago.

00:16:38.545 --> 00:16:41.945
Then and now, you are what is most important to me.

00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:49.115
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

00:16:51.785 --> 00:16:55.095
The Royal Concubine, who defied my edict and escaped...

00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:59.465
No, the Deposed Crown Princess Gang...

00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:02.035
is hereby sentenced to death by strangulation.

00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:06.805
- As you command, Your Majesty! - As you command, Your Majesty!

00:17:07.305 --> 00:17:09.875
No, you cannot do this. You cannot do this, Your Majesty.

00:17:11.705 --> 00:17:13.045
Left Flank Guard and Eunuch Yoon,

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:15.375
take the Crown Prince to his palace.

00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:19.085
- Yes, Your Majesty. - You cannot do this, Your Majesty!

00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:22.955
Let me go! Please do not do this!

00:17:23.215 --> 00:17:25.255
Please spare the Crown Princess's life!

00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:28.725
Please do not do this! You cannot do this, Your Majesty!

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:33.025
Spare the Crown Princess' life! Let me go!

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.465
Are you satisfied now?

00:17:34.995 --> 00:17:35.995
Your grace is...

00:17:36.735 --> 00:17:39.005
immeasurable, Your Majesty.

00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:43.105
- Your grace is immeasurable, - Your grace is immeasurable,

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.345
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

00:17:47.475 --> 00:17:48.745
What are you talking about?

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.085
The Royal Concubine is the Crown Princess?

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.785
I know. I did not believe it either.

00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:58.785
But tons of people saw it. At that crowded execution ground,

00:17:58.925 --> 00:18:00.385
the Royal Concubine herself...

00:18:00.385 --> 00:18:02.225
claimed to be the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:06.565
Prepare my official robes.

00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:08.165
Yes, sir.

00:18:14.005 --> 00:18:15.535
If the Royal Concubine is really the Deposed Crown Princess,

00:18:16.205 --> 00:18:17.975
what is going to happen to her now?

00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:21.175
I heard His Majesty ordered her executed by strangulation.

00:18:22.245 --> 00:18:23.315
The Royal Concubine...

00:18:24.715 --> 00:18:26.445
No, if the Deposed Crown Princess dies again,

00:18:26.845 --> 00:18:28.385
the Crown Prince will be completely broken.

00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:30.885
Are you worried about His Highness?

00:18:30.885 --> 00:18:32.185
I am worried about myself.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.355
If the Crown Prince falls, then no one can stop my father,

00:18:36.925 --> 00:18:38.625
and no one will find Deok Chun for me.

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:50.605
Tell them to bring my ceremonial wedding attire.

00:18:54.575 --> 00:18:55.675
Your Highness.

00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:00.085
The Crown Princess's family returned to Unjeong Palace.

00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:01.955
They are all safe.

00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:03.615
Good. That is a relief.

00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:07.155
But what about the Crown Princess? What do we do now?

00:19:10.755 --> 00:19:14.725
Give the order, Your Highness, and I will break her out of prison.

00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:15.835
No!

00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:18.265
One reckless move, and we will lose Dal all over again.

00:19:25.305 --> 00:19:26.875
You must not get worked up.

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.875
You must not do anything reckless, Your Highness.

00:19:39.385 --> 00:19:41.285
Please take care of my family for me.

00:19:50.095 --> 00:19:51.805
This is just like what happened five years ago.

00:19:55.075 --> 00:19:57.105
We must be extremely cautious.

00:19:58.445 --> 00:19:59.505
Your Highness.

00:19:59.845 --> 00:20:01.545
Grand Prince Je Un is here to see you.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.745
Did you come because you heard the news about Dal?

00:20:07.285 --> 00:20:10.055
Yes, but there is something strange going on.

00:20:10.755 --> 00:20:11.755
Strange? How so?

00:20:11.825 --> 00:20:16.155
I was at the Royal Office of Attire. U Hui asked for the wedding attire.

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:23.695
- Is it ready? - Yes, Your Highness.

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:25.705
Yeo Ri will help me. The rest of you may leave.

00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:35.005
My lady. Please step outside for a moment.

00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:38.145
We will call you if we need any help.

00:20:38.515 --> 00:20:40.985
- But... - Please just go.

00:21:02.635 --> 00:21:04.235
It was always going to end this way.

00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:06.905
You took quite the detour to get here.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:09.275
What are you going to do with me now?

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:12.545
You will be sentenced to death by strangulation shortly.

00:21:12.915 --> 00:21:14.215
If you kill me,

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:16.985
do you think the Crown Prince will simply do nothing?

00:21:17.455 --> 00:21:18.685
His Highness?

00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:21.955
What could he possibly do?

00:21:24.895 --> 00:21:26.795
At my mother's grave that day,

00:21:27.695 --> 00:21:29.465
I must have seen something I should not have.

00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:32.705
What in the world is on Mount Gamak?

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.065
Mount Gamak.

00:21:40.245 --> 00:21:43.915
I know exactly what you are hiding on Mount Gamak.

00:21:44.745 --> 00:21:46.085
If I die here today,

00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:48.515
the Crown Prince will reveal your secret.

00:21:48.985 --> 00:21:50.915
After all, His Majesty and His Highness...

00:21:51.825 --> 00:21:53.625
were already considering giving up the throne.

00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:56.355
With nothing left to lose, they will not hesitate to expose you.

00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:00.395
Who do you think stands to lose more?

00:22:06.465 --> 00:22:07.665
Your Highness.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.605
You seem intent on digging your own grave over this.

00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.555
So there really is something there.

00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:38.705
I have to get this information to His Royal Highness.

00:22:43.135 --> 00:22:46.045
Do you not think you are reading too much into a simple fitting?

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:47.975
This is a woman who shot me in the heart...

00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:49.115
to avoid the Royal Wedding,

00:22:49.215 --> 00:22:52.445
Now she is volunteering to be fit. You do not find that odd?

00:23:05.295 --> 00:23:06.725
There really is a note.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:08.765
Impressive deduction.

00:23:25.385 --> 00:23:26.785
What does it say?

00:23:36.325 --> 00:23:39.265
I will escape the Detached Palace. Please send help.

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:42.295
I will create a diversion to distract my father.

00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:44.865
So use that chance to help the Royal Concubine escape.

00:23:45.935 --> 00:23:49.135
When you are ready, signal with a cuckoo call.

00:23:55.615 --> 00:23:56.915
I will do it.

00:23:56.915 --> 00:23:58.575
The Crown Princess Consort could be in danger.

00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:00.015
She is my woman.

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:03.355
I will not let her get hurt.

00:24:06.085 --> 00:24:07.255
All right.

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.425
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:30.515
Is this the silk from the Hanyang Merchant Guild?

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:32.115
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:35.215
May I ask why you ask, Your Highness?

00:24:35.585 --> 00:24:38.015
Do you believe this crude pattern is fit for the Royal Family?

00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:40.925
Tell the Hanyang Merchant Guild to take this back immediately...

00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:42.195
and send a replacement.

00:24:42.925 --> 00:24:44.055
Yes, Your Highness.

00:25:37.445 --> 00:25:38.915
Your Highness.

00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:41.945
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:45.885
Your Highness.

00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:48.155
What happened?

00:25:48.225 --> 00:25:49.695
She has had no food or drink for days.

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:51.155
It seems she has finally collapsed.

00:25:51.325 --> 00:25:52.665
Send for the Royal Physician now!

00:25:53.595 --> 00:25:55.995
Stay back. I will stab anyone who comes near me.

00:25:59.405 --> 00:26:01.235
- Yeo Ri. - Yes.

00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:07.205
You. Take off your clothes.

00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:49.655
Pardon the intrusion, my lord.

00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:54.925
The Crown Princess Consort...

00:26:55.895 --> 00:26:56.955
has escaped...

00:26:58.555 --> 00:26:59.865
from the Detached Palace.

00:27:02.535 --> 00:27:03.865
Was this Prince Je Un's doing?

00:27:04.065 --> 00:27:07.705
I already sent someone to check. Our spy at Eunwol Pavilion says...

00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:10.035
he has been there all day.

00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:12.945
What about the Deposed Crown Princess in the prison?

00:27:13.545 --> 00:27:15.875
- I will go and check. - No.

00:27:17.115 --> 00:27:18.715
I will check on her myself.

00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:28.425
Left State Councillor. What brings you here?

00:27:28.725 --> 00:27:30.625
You just sent over a senior court lady from the Detached Palace.

00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:45.035
Open the door.

00:27:45.405 --> 00:27:46.545
Yes, my lord.

00:27:47.445 --> 00:27:48.475
Stop right there!

00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:52.585
Halt!

00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:55.315
- Seize him! - Surround him!

00:27:55.415 --> 00:27:56.455
Get him!

00:27:57.515 --> 00:27:58.925
Rescue Her Highness!

00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:20.075
- Get that man! - Seize him!

00:28:21.645 --> 00:28:23.215
Her Highness is the priority!

00:28:24.145 --> 00:28:26.185
Your Highness, are you all right?

00:28:26.415 --> 00:28:27.485
Your Highness!

00:28:28.215 --> 00:28:30.615
- Your Highness, please dismount. - Your Highness!

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:32.585
Your Highness.

00:28:57.615 --> 00:28:58.985
How dare you...

00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:05.555
I will take the Royal Concubine's place in prison.

00:29:05.755 --> 00:29:07.525
You take her and get away from here.

00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:09.125
(Get away from here.)

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:13.765
I am Senior Court Lady Jin Mi Ryeong of the Detached Palace.

00:29:14.495 --> 00:29:17.035
The Left State Councillor sent me to see the Deposed Crown Princess.

00:29:18.535 --> 00:29:20.135
Of all the times, right during the shift change?

00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:22.005
Go on in.

00:29:34.285 --> 00:29:37.255
What? Crown Princess Consort? What are you doing here?

00:29:40.185 --> 00:29:41.725
You need to get out of here and find Deok Chun.

00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:43.295
Give her this letter.

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:46.995
To Choraengi Mask?

00:29:49.535 --> 00:29:50.535
It is unlocked.

00:29:54.335 --> 00:29:55.435
We are out of time.

00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:58.405
Hold on. What is the plan?

00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:00.375
A little switcheroo.

00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:05.245
The Deposed Crown Princess has escaped! Find her!

00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:06.345
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:30:18.195 --> 00:30:19.195
All right.

00:30:20.925 --> 00:30:21.995
Let us move out.

00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:23.765
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:30:29.975 --> 00:30:31.005
Halt!

00:30:32.475 --> 00:30:33.575
Keep moving.

00:30:36.215 --> 00:30:39.985
- What is all this? - Yes, sir. This is...

00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:44.415
silk for the Royal Office of Attire. But we were ordered to redeliver it.

00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:46.985
I have no record of that order, so I will have to inspect it.

00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:49.655
But this is the Royal Office of Attire seal.

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:50.825
Step aside.

00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:58.095
This is bad.

00:31:15.615 --> 00:31:17.785
Be careful!

00:31:18.415 --> 00:31:22.155
Each roll is 100 nyang. If you tear even a single thread,

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:25.355
you will be buying this entire box.

00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:27.095
One, two, three, four, five.

00:31:27.165 --> 00:31:29.835
Gosh, that is enough to buy a fine house.

00:31:30.035 --> 00:31:34.005
How many years' pay for a guard? Twenty?

00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:36.805
Two hundred years? Good grief.

00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:39.075
So be very careful with your inspection.

00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:46.615
- Get out of here. - Right away, sir.

00:31:46.985 --> 00:31:48.485
Thank you, sir.

00:31:57.555 --> 00:31:58.555
Hurry.

00:31:59.895 --> 00:32:01.095
Let us go. Hurry.

00:32:04.865 --> 00:32:06.705
Tell the Hanyang Merchant Guild to take this back immediately...

00:32:06.705 --> 00:32:08.035
and send a replacement.

00:32:08.835 --> 00:32:09.835
Yes, Your Highness.

00:32:14.545 --> 00:32:16.545
How can you be thinking about silk at a time like this?

00:32:17.045 --> 00:32:20.785
Always be aware of your surroundings no matter the circumstances.

00:32:32.995 --> 00:32:36.495
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess have safely escaped the palace.

00:32:38.695 --> 00:32:39.765
Thank goodness.

00:32:42.905 --> 00:32:43.905
In the end,

00:32:45.035 --> 00:32:47.005
nothing has changed from five years ago.

00:32:48.045 --> 00:32:51.445
Then and now, you are what is most important to me.

00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:55.115
I have found evidence...

00:32:56.415 --> 00:32:59.725
that the Left State Councillor has a private army called The Nameless.

00:33:00.725 --> 00:33:03.225
- A private army? - This is treason.

00:33:03.995 --> 00:33:05.025
However,

00:33:05.895 --> 00:33:07.725
I do not have any definitive proof yet.

00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.335
According to this letter from Dal,

00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:11.765
the Choraengi Mask is in Yangju,

00:33:11.765 --> 00:33:13.605
and The Nameless are in a mountain fortress.

00:33:14.305 --> 00:33:15.765
Let us search the nearby mountains.

00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:19.035
All I know is that their base of operations is in Yangju.

00:33:19.475 --> 00:33:21.305
Speaking of which,

00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:23.575
if I were to die,

00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:26.315
someone else will release the secret pact.

00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:29.385
The secret pact must be there.

00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:31.485
The Left State Councillor said...

00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:33.985
the secret pact would be released if he died.

00:33:33.985 --> 00:33:35.085
He must have...

00:33:35.425 --> 00:33:38.355
hidden it with the one he trusts most, the leader of The Nameless.

00:33:39.225 --> 00:33:40.525
Do you have a plan?

00:33:40.825 --> 00:33:43.765
I plan to go to Yangju with Je Un to find the base of The Nameless.

00:33:45.635 --> 00:33:47.565
You will be risking your life.

00:33:48.865 --> 00:33:50.205
Are you prepared for that?

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:53.205
No. I have no intention of just rolling over and dying.

00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:56.945
I am not the same Yeon Wol who quietly vanished five years ago.

00:33:57.345 --> 00:33:58.445
I am not leaving...

00:34:00.045 --> 00:34:01.345
His Highness' side, ever.

00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:05.215
I will survive and live the rest of my days in happiness.

00:34:05.925 --> 00:34:07.285
As if to spite them for the past,

00:34:07.785 --> 00:34:09.055
I will live a life they can only envy.

00:34:09.855 --> 00:34:11.325
Things are different from five years ago.

00:34:19.565 --> 00:34:20.635
You are right.

00:34:22.005 --> 00:34:24.035
Both the Crown Princess and you, the Crown Prince, have changed,

00:34:25.635 --> 00:34:27.845
so there is no reason why I should stay the same.

00:34:28.505 --> 00:34:29.975
As they demand, I will sentence the Crown Princess...

00:34:29.975 --> 00:34:31.175
to death by strangulation.

00:34:31.915 --> 00:34:33.545
When the Left State Councillor lets his guard down,

00:34:33.985 --> 00:34:35.985
take the Crown Princess and escape the palace.

00:34:37.955 --> 00:34:38.955
Royal Father.

00:34:39.215 --> 00:34:40.325
Bring me the Royal Tally.

00:34:40.525 --> 00:34:41.685
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:04.845
Take this.

00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:05.985
(Royal Tally: This wooden tablet mobilizes troops...)

00:35:06.045 --> 00:35:08.485
(when its two halves are joined.)

00:35:10.385 --> 00:35:11.455
I am so sorry.

00:35:14.255 --> 00:35:17.055
For being a cowardly father who was not always there for you.

00:35:21.065 --> 00:35:22.265
I will be right back,

00:35:23.365 --> 00:35:24.395
Father.

00:35:35.405 --> 00:35:38.445
My lord, you must hurry. Goodness.

00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:14.045
So,

00:36:14.945 --> 00:36:17.215
is that snoring supposed to be convincing?

00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:24.325
My lord, what took you so long? I was just...

00:36:26.095 --> 00:36:27.925
No, wait. Why are you even here?

00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:30.535
You should have grabbed the Crown Princess Consort's hand...

00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:31.565
and just run for it.

00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:35.565
To survive.

00:36:37.405 --> 00:36:38.535
So I can live...

00:36:40.505 --> 00:36:41.675
and wait.

00:36:47.385 --> 00:36:48.445
U Hui.

00:37:04.035 --> 00:37:06.235
They will find out I have escaped any second now.

00:37:07.135 --> 00:37:08.235
You have to hurry.

00:37:09.005 --> 00:37:10.005
Okay.

00:37:17.915 --> 00:37:19.815
Buy me as much time as you can.

00:37:21.945 --> 00:37:23.315
I have to go now.

00:37:30.455 --> 00:37:31.495
U Hui.

00:37:36.535 --> 00:37:37.835
Will you not be in danger?

00:37:41.865 --> 00:37:43.335
If the bait is trying to save its own skin,

00:37:45.735 --> 00:37:47.405
the fish will never bite.

00:38:10.765 --> 00:38:11.795
I do not know.

00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:14.265
I do not know about any of that.

00:38:15.735 --> 00:38:16.735
How...

00:38:18.075 --> 00:38:19.505
can I possibly leave you behind?

00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:24.045
Can we not just run away together, right now?

00:39:14.325 --> 00:39:15.325
You must live.

00:39:16.465 --> 00:39:20.105
If you get caught this time, my father will kill you.

00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:22.465
So...

00:39:25.975 --> 00:39:27.145
live for me, Un.

00:39:33.215 --> 00:39:34.545
I will come back to you.

00:40:12.755 --> 00:40:13.755
Let us go.

00:40:14.085 --> 00:40:15.085
Yes, Your Highness.

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:24.895
Where is the Deposed Crown Princess?

00:40:25.895 --> 00:40:26.935
I do not know.

00:40:27.835 --> 00:40:30.005
Even if I did,

00:40:31.435 --> 00:40:33.005
would I have taken all this trouble to tell you?

00:40:59.735 --> 00:41:00.765
Yeo Ri.

00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:05.505
Yeo...

00:41:06.605 --> 00:41:07.645
Yeo Ri!

00:41:15.485 --> 00:41:16.485
Yeo Ri.

00:41:19.785 --> 00:41:20.785
Yeo Ri.

00:41:32.895 --> 00:41:34.565
Even if I were to kill 100 more like her,

00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:37.075
you would not even bat an eye.

00:42:04.265 --> 00:42:06.335
Find the Deposed Crown Princess, no matter what it takes.

00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:07.705
Yes, my lord.

00:42:08.435 --> 00:42:10.175
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:11.905
- Get her! - Yes, sir!

00:42:15.005 --> 00:42:17.915
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:35.795
Looks like the horse is tired too.

00:42:36.695 --> 00:42:39.095
We cannot blame him. We have been riding nonstop.

00:42:40.405 --> 00:42:42.405
Should we find an inn in a nearby town?

00:42:43.705 --> 00:42:44.735
Let us do that.

00:42:49.145 --> 00:42:50.245
Hey, you! Get over here!

00:42:52.315 --> 00:42:53.915
You know this woman or not?

00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:58.115
- What are you doing? - How dare you?

00:42:59.785 --> 00:43:01.285
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

00:43:01.355 --> 00:43:03.655
Look closely. Do you know her or not?

00:43:04.295 --> 00:43:05.355
I said, take a good look.

00:43:05.955 --> 00:43:07.525
I said look, you jerk!

00:43:08.165 --> 00:43:09.165
Take a good look!

00:43:10.695 --> 00:43:11.695
Let us go.

00:43:12.795 --> 00:43:13.805
Okay.

00:43:18.605 --> 00:43:22.245
- The sun will be setting soon. - What? Let me see.

00:43:22.905 --> 00:43:24.745
Okay, this is Mount Bulgok.

00:43:26.985 --> 00:43:31.585
Right, follow me. I have an amazing swallow stashed away nearby.

00:43:31.985 --> 00:43:36.055
What? Wait, just how many swallows do you have?

00:43:36.795 --> 00:43:37.825
Hurry on now.

00:43:39.295 --> 00:43:40.925
This is the place.

00:43:43.595 --> 00:43:44.595
I see.

00:43:45.365 --> 00:43:46.565
It looks like no one is home.

00:43:47.105 --> 00:43:49.975
- Here, come on in. - Hey, wait a minute.

00:43:52.275 --> 00:43:53.275
Are you sure this is the right house?

00:43:54.345 --> 00:43:55.645
See this stone clock?

00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:59.045
It means they have gone far off to gather medicinal herbs.

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:00.385
Come on in.

00:44:03.485 --> 00:44:04.655
That is what that means?

00:44:07.385 --> 00:44:10.225
A grateful man I saved once told me...

00:44:10.225 --> 00:44:12.355
to stop by if I was in the area.

00:44:12.725 --> 00:44:15.165
He said if no one was home, I could make myself comfortable.

00:44:16.325 --> 00:44:17.335
Okay?

00:44:17.935 --> 00:44:22.035
I told you, Your Royal Highness. Just trust me and follow.

00:44:22.335 --> 00:44:23.335
This way.

00:44:25.575 --> 00:44:26.705
What do you mean by that?

00:44:27.245 --> 00:44:28.705
What do you mean, we have to go to Mount Gamak?

00:44:29.005 --> 00:44:31.675
Actually, on the day I was arrested,

00:44:32.215 --> 00:44:33.885
I exchanged a few words with the Left State Councillor.

00:44:34.645 --> 00:44:36.785
Something felt off, so I prodded him a bit.

00:44:37.055 --> 00:44:39.955
The way he got flustered was unusual and has been bothering me.

00:44:42.985 --> 00:44:46.925
(6 years ago, Mount Gamak, Yeon Wol's Mother's Grave)

00:44:50.165 --> 00:44:51.165
We should go.

00:44:53.435 --> 00:44:54.835
Please take me to the palace.

00:44:56.735 --> 00:44:58.975
- Who are you? - This letter...

00:45:02.945 --> 00:45:05.275
My apologies. This is my lady.

00:45:05.445 --> 00:45:07.485
She lost her son and has not been in her right mind since.

00:45:08.245 --> 00:45:11.115
My lady, you should at least put on your shoes.

00:45:11.385 --> 00:45:12.415
The ground is frozen.

00:45:23.835 --> 00:45:25.035
Please excuse our intrusion.

00:45:25.395 --> 00:45:27.405
- Let us go. - Let me go!

00:45:27.465 --> 00:45:31.005
Your Highness. Based on her clothes, she seems to be from a noble family.

00:45:32.535 --> 00:45:33.745
There are no signs of abuse either.

00:45:35.505 --> 00:45:36.745
I did not realise it at the time,

00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:40.415
but her socks were not worn out, and her clothes were clean.

00:45:41.015 --> 00:45:43.115
She did not look like someone who had crossed mountains and rivers.

00:45:44.685 --> 00:45:47.125
Are you saying The Nameless have a base on Mount Gamak?

00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:49.525
Yes, most likely.

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:52.595
And above all, my brother.

00:45:53.465 --> 00:45:56.165
Have you learned of the woman in white on Mount Gamak?

00:45:59.665 --> 00:46:01.005
I am still looking into it.

00:46:01.605 --> 00:46:04.605
I will report back once I have investigated more thoroughly.

00:46:05.035 --> 00:46:08.345
Then you did not come to tell me about that woman?

00:46:09.705 --> 00:46:11.715
If something should happen to me,

00:46:13.345 --> 00:46:15.345
please give this book to His Royal Highness.

00:46:17.255 --> 00:46:19.955
What do you mean by that? If something should happen?

00:46:20.525 --> 00:46:24.195
Soon after that, I was deposed, and my family was wiped out.

00:46:25.025 --> 00:46:26.395
The woman in white on Mount Gamak.

00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:29.495
The Nameless, who are protecting her.

00:46:30.635 --> 00:46:32.595
And the book my brother left behind while tracking her.

00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.865
I am sure there is a clue in it.

00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:37.235
Wait a minute.

00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:39.275
A book, you say?

00:46:40.205 --> 00:46:41.345
By any chance,

00:46:42.575 --> 00:46:43.575
was that book a military treatise?

00:46:44.915 --> 00:46:45.915
How did you know?

00:46:46.515 --> 00:46:48.345
Five years ago, I had your things gathered and stored...

00:46:48.345 --> 00:46:50.015
in the Royal Office of Attire.

00:46:50.685 --> 00:46:52.185
Oddly, there was a military treatise among them,

00:46:52.715 --> 00:46:54.125
and I remember thinking it was strange.

00:47:00.125 --> 00:47:02.125
There has to be a major clue inside.

00:47:04.495 --> 00:47:05.735
But we cannot get into the palace,

00:47:07.305 --> 00:47:09.165
and the whole place is crawling with their shadowy thugs.

00:47:10.735 --> 00:47:12.235
Whether it is Mount Gamak or the palace,

00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:14.405
it is too dangerous to make a move right now.

00:47:14.975 --> 00:47:16.845
Let us lie low for a few days first.

00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:19.775
Okay.

00:47:33.825 --> 00:47:35.465
Oh, gosh.

00:47:35.495 --> 00:47:36.665
Where are you off to?

00:47:37.195 --> 00:47:38.235
You are awake?

00:47:38.935 --> 00:47:40.565
I was just about to make some breakfast.

00:47:41.535 --> 00:47:42.535
No, do not!

00:47:45.035 --> 00:47:46.105
What do you mean?

00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:48.905
I will do it.

00:47:50.845 --> 00:47:53.515
Do not worry about it. I will do it.

00:47:58.555 --> 00:48:00.555
You just do not want to eat my cooking?

00:48:00.755 --> 00:48:03.255
No, that is not it.

00:48:03.955 --> 00:48:05.925
I think I can handle it.

00:48:06.725 --> 00:48:07.825
I think I can handle it.

00:48:08.425 --> 00:48:10.465
No.

00:48:10.465 --> 00:48:12.335
I can do this.

00:48:12.535 --> 00:48:13.535
No!

00:48:15.005 --> 00:48:17.135
Darn. Gosh!

00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:19.405
You, the Crown Prince, and me...

00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:21.445
We are both useless when it comes to cooking.

00:48:21.945 --> 00:48:22.945
Let me see.

00:48:32.315 --> 00:48:33.825
What are you doing with that knife?

00:48:36.155 --> 00:48:37.625
Move aside. Let me do it.

00:48:37.895 --> 00:48:38.955
Oh, gosh!

00:49:09.925 --> 00:49:10.995
How come he is good?

00:49:12.355 --> 00:49:13.595
I have learned that knife work...

00:49:14.965 --> 00:49:16.565
is all pretty much the same.

00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:18.535
It is only how you slice that is different.

00:49:20.165 --> 00:49:21.565
And what have you sliced before?

00:49:24.105 --> 00:49:26.235
I am telling you, it is not as easy as it looks.

00:49:26.735 --> 00:49:28.645
A beginner cannot just do it.

00:49:29.605 --> 00:49:33.515
Watch closely. This is not about brute force.

00:49:34.215 --> 00:49:35.245
It is all about the technique.

00:49:46.225 --> 00:49:47.495
I knew this would happen.

00:49:48.295 --> 00:49:49.995
- Gosh, hold on. - Your skills...

00:49:49.995 --> 00:49:52.135
will not give you rice from your lady.

00:49:52.835 --> 00:49:53.835
Give it here.

00:49:54.405 --> 00:49:55.405
Goodness.

00:49:55.735 --> 00:49:57.035
If you were that lady,

00:49:57.835 --> 00:49:59.405
I would not eat that rice anyway.

00:50:01.805 --> 00:50:04.345
I am good at chopping more than just firewood.

00:50:15.855 --> 00:50:17.995
- Is it good? - Yes.

00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:26.465
- Is it good? - It is delicious.

00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:32.035
These walnuts...

00:50:32.775 --> 00:50:35.375
These would be great with persimmons, do you not think?

00:50:36.575 --> 00:50:39.915
A true prince, focused on persimmons at a time like this.

00:50:40.585 --> 00:50:43.015
Who said it was for me? I wanted...

00:50:43.085 --> 00:50:45.355
to give you something delicious to eat, that is all.

00:50:46.115 --> 00:50:47.555
Come on.

00:50:50.555 --> 00:50:53.325
Any other time, maybe. But not now. I do not want any persimmons.

00:50:54.195 --> 00:50:55.195
Why?

00:50:55.525 --> 00:50:57.665
Because if we go outside to find persimmons,

00:50:57.665 --> 00:50:58.895
we might die right away.

00:51:13.885 --> 00:51:14.885
I mean,

00:51:15.645 --> 00:51:18.085
it is so sweltering, even at night.

00:51:18.715 --> 00:51:21.585
So I made a chilling joke to cool us down.

00:51:21.955 --> 00:51:23.455
No need to look so serious.

00:51:30.465 --> 00:51:31.465
What if we...

00:51:34.465 --> 00:51:35.935
just ran away from all this?

00:51:38.575 --> 00:51:40.545
What are you talking about?

00:51:41.575 --> 00:51:43.045
The military treatise my brother left behind...

00:51:43.345 --> 00:51:45.745
might have clues about The Nameless.

00:51:51.755 --> 00:51:52.955
And what if it is another dead end?

00:51:55.755 --> 00:51:57.395
What if that is not enough to beat the Left State Councillor?

00:52:00.295 --> 00:52:01.295
And what if, in the end,

00:52:05.665 --> 00:52:06.865
I cannot protect you?

00:52:12.135 --> 00:52:13.535
You are here, alive and well.

00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:18.245
And we are right here,

00:52:20.275 --> 00:52:21.845
smiling at each other.

00:52:23.655 --> 00:52:25.015
All this talk of revenge and justice...

00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:28.885
What does any of it matter?

00:52:33.765 --> 00:52:35.495
I just want to be your Lee Gang.

00:52:38.235 --> 00:52:39.235
Can we not just...

00:52:41.465 --> 00:52:42.665
live like that?

00:53:18.805 --> 00:53:20.205
If the Crown Prince is gone,

00:53:20.945 --> 00:53:22.875
the next in line is Grand Prince Je Un.

00:53:24.475 --> 00:53:26.875
We must stop Grand Prince Je Un...

00:53:27.915 --> 00:53:29.785
from taking the throne at all costs.

00:53:30.045 --> 00:53:32.755
But he is your only blood relative, Your Majesty.

00:53:33.215 --> 00:53:36.385
Better for him to take the throne than a stranger...

00:53:36.455 --> 00:53:37.455
I...

00:53:37.755 --> 00:53:40.565
framed Grand Prince Je Un's mother for adultery and had her killed.

00:53:40.865 --> 00:53:42.895
And I banished him to Sinjusa.

00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:48.565
Who knows what vengeance he harbours in his dark heart?

00:53:49.565 --> 00:53:50.575
He must never,

00:53:51.135 --> 00:53:53.745
ever sit on the throne.

00:53:56.005 --> 00:53:57.005
Your Majesty.

00:53:57.375 --> 00:54:00.915
There is a rumour spreading secretly among the court ladies.

00:54:19.635 --> 00:54:21.305
Where is the Left State Councillor?

00:54:23.705 --> 00:54:26.675
I am aware that the Crown Princess Consort...

00:54:27.575 --> 00:54:29.845
eloped with Grand Prince Je Un...

00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:32.075
not too long ago.

00:54:33.275 --> 00:54:35.185
Did you summon me just to threaten me?

00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:39.915
I summoned you to make a deal.

00:54:42.585 --> 00:54:44.925
Even if you cannot find the Crown Prince,

00:54:46.695 --> 00:54:48.925
you must stop Grand Prince Je Un...

00:54:50.635 --> 00:54:51.635
from taking the throne.

00:54:52.265 --> 00:54:53.335
But Grand Prince Je Un...

00:54:54.235 --> 00:54:56.665
is your only blood relative, is he not?

00:54:57.035 --> 00:54:58.805
I have never once...

00:54:59.775 --> 00:55:02.005
considered that boy my grandson.

00:55:03.345 --> 00:55:05.375
A prophecy foretold that if Queen Jangjeong had a son...

00:55:06.175 --> 00:55:08.115
and that son became the Crown Prince,

00:55:08.385 --> 00:55:09.385
the late King...

00:55:10.385 --> 00:55:13.415
would not live out his natural life.

00:55:14.285 --> 00:55:15.585
And that prophecy came true.

00:55:16.985 --> 00:55:19.525
Grand Prince Je Un should never have been born.

00:55:20.695 --> 00:55:22.795
No, from the very beginning,

00:55:23.935 --> 00:55:24.935
Queen Jangjeong,

00:55:25.935 --> 00:55:27.535
a woman so wretched,

00:55:28.235 --> 00:55:30.535
should never have been made Queen.

00:55:32.005 --> 00:55:33.535
The curse upon the Royal Family...

00:55:34.075 --> 00:55:35.875
and the tragedy of today.

00:55:36.445 --> 00:55:37.875
It is all because of that mother and son.

00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:42.785
So for the throne to now go to Grand Prince Je Un...

00:55:43.385 --> 00:55:44.685
is utterly unthinkable.

00:55:50.955 --> 00:55:52.055
Your Majesty,

00:55:54.165 --> 00:55:56.395
you have not changed one bit.

00:55:58.935 --> 00:56:01.635
I thought I had taken everything.

00:56:03.435 --> 00:56:05.405
What are you still protecting?

00:56:06.475 --> 00:56:09.475
Why are you still clinging to your avarice?

00:56:10.775 --> 00:56:12.015
Taken everything?

00:56:14.785 --> 00:56:15.885
What do you mean?

00:56:18.585 --> 00:56:22.055
Do you really believe what happened in the Gyesa Year...

00:56:22.555 --> 00:56:24.525
was because of some prophecy?

00:56:25.855 --> 00:56:27.865
You are still blaming...

00:56:27.865 --> 00:56:29.995
Queen Jangjeong and Grand Prince Je Un?

00:56:31.295 --> 00:56:32.765
What happened in the Gyesa Year...

00:56:35.205 --> 00:56:37.165
was because of you, Your Majesty.

00:56:43.345 --> 00:56:46.515
Why did you do that to Queen Jangjeong?

00:58:09.595 --> 00:58:10.735
Royal Mother!

00:58:11.835 --> 00:58:13.035
Royal Mother!

00:58:18.635 --> 00:58:19.735
Crown Prince,

00:58:20.635 --> 00:58:25.515
you must never resent your Royal Father.

00:58:26.375 --> 00:58:29.985
Your eyes, your nose, your lips...

00:58:31.085 --> 00:58:33.555
From the tips of your fingers to your toes,

00:58:34.925 --> 00:58:38.755
everything you are was a gift from your Royal Father.

00:58:46.395 --> 00:58:47.465
Royal Mother!

00:58:48.135 --> 00:58:49.235
Royal Mother!

00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:51.705
Royal Mother!

00:58:52.835 --> 00:58:54.475
Royal Mother!

00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:00.575
It cannot be...

00:59:08.185 --> 00:59:09.885
Why on earth...

00:59:10.755 --> 00:59:12.695
did you kill that precious woman...

00:59:15.395 --> 00:59:19.735
by framing her with such a filthy accusation of adultery?

00:59:31.175 --> 00:59:32.945
So it was my fault.

00:59:34.745 --> 00:59:35.745
So,

00:59:38.485 --> 00:59:40.555
do you not ever

00:59:43.025 --> 00:59:44.995
let the name of Queen Jangjeong...

00:59:46.495 --> 00:59:48.195
pass your lips again.

01:00:06.475 --> 01:00:07.915
We are going to Qing.

01:00:08.315 --> 01:00:10.045
My wife and I. Just the two of us.

01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:15.285
Have a boat ready for us at Jemulpo by tomorrow afternoon.

01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:17.355
Yes, of course, my lord.

01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:20.725
Wait...

01:00:22.765 --> 01:00:25.565
What? A hundred nyang?

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:04.635
His Majesty sent me.

01:01:05.005 --> 01:01:07.905
He sent me to help Your Highness in fulfilling your great cause.

01:01:08.275 --> 01:01:11.075
Wait, how did you know to find me here?

01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:13.175
I have searched the entire area.

01:01:30.765 --> 01:01:32.535
Wait...

01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:34.665
They are here!

01:01:45.815 --> 01:01:47.215
Hand over the Deposed Crown Princess...

01:01:47.215 --> 01:01:48.585
and return to the palace, Your Highness.

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:50.145
I refuse.

01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:53.085
We have orders to bring you back, by force if necessary.

01:01:53.215 --> 01:01:54.325
Is that right?

01:01:55.885 --> 01:01:59.025
- Take Dal and go. That is an order. - Your Highness.

01:01:59.025 --> 01:02:02.765
- How can I leave you behind? - Go now! From this moment,

01:02:03.795 --> 01:02:04.935
I am doing things my way.

01:02:11.635 --> 01:02:13.235
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

01:02:15.445 --> 01:02:17.345
Fine. Come and get me.

01:02:18.075 --> 01:02:19.075
Whatever dream he has,

01:02:19.075 --> 01:02:20.875
come at me if you want to ruin the Left State Councillor's dream.

01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:25.815
Go!

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:32.395
What are you waiting for? Clear a path.

01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:41.435
Clear the way!

01:02:56.115 --> 01:02:57.115
You should go now.

01:02:58.785 --> 01:02:59.785
Right.

01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:12.865
But Your Highness...

01:03:14.565 --> 01:03:18.235
Is it enough for just the two of us to be happy?

01:03:21.045 --> 01:03:24.315
What about the Crown Princess Consort and Prince Je Un?

01:03:25.615 --> 01:03:28.085
And even His Majesty, who is waiting anxiously for us?

01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:34.525
If we turn our backs on everyone who is counting on us,

01:03:37.085 --> 01:03:38.295
can we truly be happy?

01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:41.665
The Left State Councillor will continue...

01:03:41.665 --> 01:03:42.925
to get away with his evil deeds.

01:03:43.425 --> 01:03:46.335
And if we live on the run when we have done nothing wrong,

01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.135
would that not be a raw deal?

01:03:49.865 --> 01:03:52.135
As a peddler, I cannot stand taking a loss.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:56.005
We do not know if The Nameless's base is on Mount Gamak,

01:03:57.575 --> 01:04:00.915
or if the secret pact is even there. Nothing is certain.

01:04:06.015 --> 01:04:07.825
We have to try, even if it is a long shot.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:12.225
If there is even a small chance, we have to go look.

01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:18.595
Right now, this is our last stand. It is an all-or-nothing gamble.

01:04:19.995 --> 01:04:23.305
If there is anything we can do, we have to go all in.

01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:27.905
Even if we are flying blind, we have to charge straight ahead.

01:04:43.485 --> 01:04:44.555
You are right.

01:04:45.395 --> 01:04:46.555
We will do it your way.

01:04:50.895 --> 01:04:54.935
There is a temple called Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak.

01:04:55.005 --> 01:04:56.135
- I will wait for you there. - No, I will be the one to go.

01:04:57.975 --> 01:05:00.735
But you have to go to the palace and find that military treatise.

01:05:02.575 --> 01:05:04.715
I thought this body-swapping was a curse,

01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:08.745
but this could actually be a golden opportunity.

01:05:11.355 --> 01:05:13.115
I know how to fight, so I will go to the mountain fort.

01:05:13.185 --> 01:05:15.485
You are quick on your feet, so you find the treatise at the palace.

01:05:16.755 --> 01:05:18.725
You will be confined on arrival, so it will not be easy.

01:05:18.725 --> 01:05:20.695
But find it and send it with Je Un.

01:05:23.025 --> 01:05:25.835
Please just do as I say this time.

01:05:27.765 --> 01:05:28.765
Okay.

01:05:50.925 --> 01:05:52.725
Your Royal Highness!

01:05:53.495 --> 01:05:55.395
His Majesty ordered you to be confined.

01:05:55.565 --> 01:05:57.965
But it was not his decision, was it?

01:05:58.165 --> 01:06:00.665
An order to be confined? I will be trapped with no way out.

01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:04.235
Oh, right. I have to return "The Art of War"...

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:05.275
I borrowed from Je Un.

01:06:06.035 --> 01:06:08.805
- It is in the wardrobe. - Seriously? Is that important now?

01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:12.045
Do you remember...

01:06:13.145 --> 01:06:18.085
the moon we saw at Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak?

01:06:19.155 --> 01:06:20.885
Why are you suddenly going on about temples and moons?

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:22.425
There, the moon...

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.425
still lingers.

01:06:26.795 --> 01:06:29.565
Return the book to Je Un. The military treatise.

01:07:16.205 --> 01:07:17.475
"The Art of War".

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:21.885
Right.

01:07:23.145 --> 01:07:25.185
("The Art of War")

01:07:31.755 --> 01:07:35.425
The Crown Prince told you to deliver this book to me?

01:07:35.665 --> 01:07:36.725
Yes.

01:07:43.635 --> 01:07:46.375
He also mentioned the Royal Tally and the moon we saw...

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:48.275
at Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak.

01:07:48.905 --> 01:07:53.475
But I do not recall ever going to Mount Gamak with His Highness.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.955
The moon?

01:08:00.155 --> 01:08:04.225
He said, "The moon still lingers there."

01:08:05.555 --> 01:08:09.395
Maybe he is saying the Crown Princess is at Jeungyeongsa?

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.875
But this is just a military treatise.

01:08:24.505 --> 01:08:25.715
What is different about it?

01:08:40.155 --> 01:08:41.195
It is different.

01:08:46.865 --> 01:08:50.065
I found The Nameless's hideout in the military treatise.

01:08:50.205 --> 01:08:52.705
I will be back within three days at the latest.

01:08:53.235 --> 01:08:56.175
The Nameless's hideout?

01:08:56.875 --> 01:09:00.145
Six years ago, at Mount Gamak...

01:09:00.675 --> 01:09:03.285
I saw a woman in white mourning with The Nameless.

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:04.955
Let me go!

01:09:09.085 --> 01:09:10.085
Wait a minute.

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:13.355
The woman in white.

01:09:14.555 --> 01:09:15.565
The letter.

01:10:39.575 --> 01:10:41.685
I hear they are about to issue a Marriage Ban.

01:10:44.955 --> 01:10:47.715
- A ribbon? - If I become strong enough...

01:10:48.285 --> 01:10:49.855
to protect you after passing the exam,

01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:53.225
can I be your husband then?

01:11:00.635 --> 01:11:02.165
Can you not please just live?

01:11:03.235 --> 01:11:04.705
Please just live.

01:11:06.235 --> 01:11:07.605
I beg of you, please live.

01:11:59.455 --> 01:12:00.655
He is my son.

01:12:08.465 --> 01:12:09.605
Now I...

01:12:10.805 --> 01:12:13.205
have become more powerful than I could have ever imagined,

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:17.805
and yet, you can never return to me.

01:12:22.185 --> 01:12:23.215
So what am I...

01:12:25.455 --> 01:12:27.115
supposed to do now?

01:12:46.135 --> 01:12:48.275
The security is very tight there. It is suspicious,

01:12:49.305 --> 01:12:50.305
sir.

01:12:51.615 --> 01:12:53.545
We should get a closer look.

01:13:00.815 --> 01:13:01.925
It is the Left State Councillor.

01:13:39.155 --> 01:13:40.155
Mother.

01:13:54.135 --> 01:13:58.915
(Moon River)

01:14:14.055 --> 01:14:16.465
The secret pact is certain to be wherever Her Highness is.

01:14:16.525 --> 01:14:18.835
Can you take the secret pact and go straight to the capital...

01:14:18.835 --> 01:14:20.235
once we find it?

01:14:20.295 --> 01:14:22.435
I appoint the daughter of the Left State Councillor Kim Han Chul...

01:14:22.435 --> 01:14:24.435
as the Crown Princess.

01:14:24.565 --> 01:14:26.635
You shattered me, Father.

01:14:26.635 --> 01:14:29.545
Now all my pieces can do is cut my husband.

01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:33.675
He will come. He said he would, so I know he will.

01:14:34.445 --> 01:14:38.415
Because this is revenge for the two of us, me and Dal.

01:14:53.295 --> 01:14:58.135
(Moon River)
