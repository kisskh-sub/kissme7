and escaped the suffering of reincarnation.

Everyone has been notified.

Don't worry, uncle.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.530
It's such a pity he passed like this.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.140
We should let all his friends

how many come to see him off

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.890

he secretly handles asset sales

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.770
Too many people died in that house.

Isn't that still revenge?

Is that all you ever think about?
