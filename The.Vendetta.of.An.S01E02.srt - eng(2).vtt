Huainan is good

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.865
A safe haven

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:45.505
The mountains and rivers
Stretch on like our affection

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:50.385
An affectionate person…

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.065
Huainan is indeed a fine place,

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:54.385
but we are no longer there.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:58.105
Huai'an truly thinks ten steps ahead.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.465
He even predicted
matters of life and death in his letter.

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:11.505
You are too gentle by nature.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.825
You are the one I worry about most.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.145
If you face something

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:20.625
you cannot overcome one day,

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.745
open this letter.

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:28.585
Zhou Mo joined the Huben Army

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:30.225
and fell under their yoke.

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:32.385
Only death could free him.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.145
Killing him was to save him.

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.785
If I make it to the Capital alive,

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:44.105
they will hunt you
to the ends of the Earth.

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.065
Only by dying once

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:49.625
can you truly be free.

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.265
ZHOU MO JOINED THE HUBEN ARMY
AND FELL UNDER THEIR YOKE.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.025
ONLY DEATH COULD FREE HIM.
KILLING HIM WAS TO SAVE HIM.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.985
No, we are no longer in Huainan.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.945
He should be in Chang'an by now.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.185
The dangers of Chang'an
far surpass Huainan's.

00:03:16.785 --> 00:03:18.545
I hope he stays safe.

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:21.825
He will.

YANG XUAN, VICE MINISTER OF REVENUE

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.185
AT DAWN I RISE

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.665
PARTING WEIGHS ON MY MIND

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:14.785
BAI WAN, YANG XUAN'S STUDENT

00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:21.745
Studying by the cold window
I never sensed how brief the seasons were

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:28.585
In a blink, my temples
Have turned to gray frost

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:29.585
REBEL FIRE

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:39.025
Schemes for the realm are but a dream

00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:47.065
I wake from wine
To Hu-horses trampling the land

00:04:50.505 --> 00:04:56.145
The loyal dead would never
Stain their bones with rebel fire

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:04.865
Yet traitors crave
The splendor of the August hall

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:13.585
Half a life I spent on these texts
For whom were they written?

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.225
For whom, I ask?

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:27.105
Let this long lament burn
As an offering unto the mountain spirits

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:36.225
Let this long lament burn
As an offering unto the mountain spirits

‎SCHOLARS' HALL

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:05.305
Sir!

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:23.585
Sir…

00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:27.345
Sir?

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:37.185
Sir…

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.225
Why are you guarding this traitor?

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:55.705
I was his student.

00:06:56.905 --> 00:06:58.985
Now that he lies dead on the street,

00:07:00.905 --> 00:07:02.665
please let me keep vigil

00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:05.705
until the Jingzhao Yamen
comes to claim his body.

00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:14.745
He was a traitor.

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:17.345
We of the Imperial Guards will take him.

00:07:18.185 --> 00:07:20.185
You call yourself his student.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:24.225
Are you a traitor too?

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.905
Sir, this has nothing to do with us.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:38.665
Please proceed.

00:07:40.305 --> 00:07:44.105
It has nothing to do with you indeed.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.985
-Take her!
-Stop.

00:08:20.665 --> 00:08:22.105
In this bitter snow,

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.505
she is willing to keep vigil
over this old man's body.

00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:27.665
It is a righteous deed,

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:30.465
yet you call her a traitor?

00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:33.625
Have you any proof?

00:08:43.945 --> 00:08:46.225
I cannot stand scholars.

00:08:46.745 --> 00:08:50.385
Are you seeking
to light your own path to the grave?

00:08:56.345 --> 00:08:57.705
You all heard him.

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.345
He tried to defend this traitor.

00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:01.825
Take him too!

00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:03.785
Hold!

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.945
Who dares bar the Imperial Guards?

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:15.025
Academician Li, what brings you here?

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:17.465
You Imperial Guards are bold indeed,

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:18.985
blocking anyone as you please.

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:22.505
Greetings to you, Mr. Huai'an.

00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:24.105
Greetings, Academician Li.

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:26.065
His Majesty awaits you in the palace.

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:27.545
Please get in.

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:33.745
"Studying by the cold window, I never
sensed how brief the seasons were."

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:35.705

"Let this long lament burn

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:01.865
You called me a traitor

00:10:02.465 --> 00:10:03.985
without a shred of proof.

00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:06.705
I recited a seditious poem just now.

00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:09.025
That, at least, is some proof.

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:13.065
Can you confirm that I am a traitor now?

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.985
You are silent.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.145
Does that mean I am not one?

00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:24.825
If we've come to a point where words alone

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:27.625
can convict someone of treason,

00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:29.865
then heed my words:

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.745
you are a traitor.

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.385
You are a traitor.

00:10:36.465 --> 00:10:37.745
A traitor!

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.185
Mr. Huai'an,

00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:45.705
don't take his words to heart.

00:10:52.665 --> 00:10:55.705
-Academician Li, I have one small request.
-Of course.

00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:57.225
Please leave them be.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:10:59.905
Very well.

00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:02.985
Be gone!

00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:05.385
I shall take my leave.

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:08.465
Let us go!

00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:10.985
This way, please.

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:16.065
ORCHID PAVILION

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:44.545
Take this to shelter him

00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:47.465
from the wind and snow.

00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:54.665
Thank you.

00:12:22.705 --> 00:12:27.385
Wan, there is something I must tell you.

00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:32.585
That article slandering the new emperor

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:34.305
was written by me.

00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:37.465
I work for the Huben Army.

00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:40.505
My rise to this post

00:12:40.585 --> 00:12:44.065
was propped up by them.

00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:46.185
Everything I did

00:12:46.705 --> 00:12:49.945
was at their command.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:54.185
Now, I must let this frail body of mine
fulfill its final purpose

00:12:54.265 --> 00:12:57.905
so that they will keep my family safe.

00:12:59.065 --> 00:13:00.265
The Huben Army

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.625
once asked me about you.

00:13:03.865 --> 00:13:05.265
After I die,

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:07.985
they will come for you.

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:12.625
I can only give you one last warning:

00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:16.425
never defy the Huben Army.

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:20.225
You still hope to see
your family again, don't you?

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:22.665
Then do whatever it takes

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:24.425
to survive.

00:13:29.905 --> 00:13:31.065
Sir…

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.145
Do not grieve for me.

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:39.025
Everyone

00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:43.905
must walk the road fate has set for them.

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:46.465
Rest now,

00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:48.945
Wan.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:56.825
This may be your last peaceful sleep.

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:00.425
Tonight,

00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:04.025
I will take my life at the city gate

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:08.025
as an old minister of the former court

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:11.065
to show my defiance of the new emperor.

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.865
Yan Fengshan commands the Huben Army

00:14:15.945 --> 00:14:17.385
and held the court in his grasp for years.

00:14:18.305 --> 00:14:20.985
Xiao Wuyang seized Chang'an

00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:23.505
to keep imperial power from slipping away.

00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:28.905
Though the Huben Army
has avoided meeting him head-on,

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:33.545
Yan Fengshan still intends
to set Chang'an aflame

00:14:34.185 --> 00:14:36.665
and grant Xiao Wuyang no peace.

00:14:39.305 --> 00:14:44.705
And I am a piece of wood
they need for that fire.

00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:54.305
‎HOUSE OF WESTERN CURIOSITIES

00:15:29.265 --> 00:15:30.425
Academician Li.

00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:32.145
I hope you do not mind

00:15:32.905 --> 00:15:34.505
that I used your hand to slap

00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:35.825
the Imperial Guards in the face.

00:15:37.345 --> 00:15:38.905
Not at all.

00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:41.105
They deserved it.

00:15:41.705 --> 00:15:43.665
I meant to humble that commander.

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.425
Even if you hadn't been there, sir,

00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:48.985
I would have simply found another way

00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:50.745
to shame him another day.

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:54.265
That is how I handle matters.

00:16:12.065 --> 00:16:12.945
Assassins!

00:16:13.025 --> 00:16:14.025
Protect His Majesty!

00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:15.425
Quick, protect His Majesty!

00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:16.585
-Understood!
-Understood!

00:16:16.665 --> 00:16:17.785
Assassins!

00:16:18.385 --> 00:16:20.905
Assassins! Protect His Majesty!

00:16:23.985 --> 00:16:25.625
The realm is still unsettled.

00:16:25.705 --> 00:16:27.865
It's been but a month
since His Majesty took the throne,

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:31.065
and already a dozen assassination attempts
have been made.

00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:33.305
No need to panic, though.

00:16:35.585 --> 00:16:37.225
Under the Dingtang Sword,

00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:40.265
all who come lose their heads.

00:17:49.305 --> 00:17:51.705
Your servant, Xie Huai'an,

00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:53.105
greets Your Majesty.

00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:57.225
Lift your head.

00:17:59.225 --> 00:18:00.505
I asked many people

00:18:00.585 --> 00:18:03.345
who could seek someone for me
in this vast world.

00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:06.305
They all recommended you,

00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:09.145
so I wished to see for myself

00:18:10.385 --> 00:18:11.745
whether you were equal to the task.

00:18:15.785 --> 00:18:18.705
These ten essays were all written
for the imperial examination

00:18:18.785 --> 00:18:20.145
in the 11th year of the dynasty.

00:18:20.785 --> 00:18:22.225
One of them was written by me.

00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:23.785
Find it.

00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:26.105
As you command.

HE UNITED THE LORDS AND STEADIED
THE REALM, RISING AS THE FOREMOST HEGEMON

00:19:07.945 --> 00:19:09.545
THE FORCEFUL RULE
AND THE BENEVOLENT RULE

00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:26.465
Your Majesty, I have found your essay.

00:19:27.465 --> 00:19:29.785
It's only been half a stick of incense.

00:19:30.745 --> 00:19:32.665
Even if you read ten lines at a glance,

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:34.905
you could only have finished
three or four essays.

00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:39.785
How did you manage it?

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:42.385
Southerners and northerners differ.

00:19:42.465 --> 00:19:44.625
Their wording and phrasing leave traces.

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:47.225
Before Your Majesty turned 20,
you lived long in Chang'an.

00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:48.345
Your early studies

00:19:48.425 --> 00:19:50.625
were under Grand Secretary Bai Linian,

00:19:51.185 --> 00:19:52.705
who was from Wuyue.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:58.025
Therefore, Your Majesty's writing
shows southern traits.

00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:00.305
Southerners write "lu" as "six,"

00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:02.905
"qi" as "stand," and "bei" as "cover."

00:20:02.985 --> 00:20:04.545
Northerners write "chen" as "ugly,"

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:06.745
"geng" as "road," and "tong" as "reach."

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:08.705
By this measure,

00:20:08.785 --> 00:20:12.065
seven of the essays
were written by northerners,

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.385
and only three by southerners.

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:18.625
Everyone has words and phrases
they tend to repeat.

00:20:18.705 --> 00:20:20.385
"In troubled times,

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:21.985
hearts are easily disturbed,

00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:24.345
so virtue alone cannot calm them."

00:20:25.105 --> 00:20:29.025
I once saw this line in a court memorial.

00:20:29.985 --> 00:20:31.665
That's how I knew.

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:33.425
How could a mere registrar

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:35.465
have access to memorials?

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:38.465
The Memorials Office
keeps expired memorials.

00:20:38.545 --> 00:20:41.505
They say they are burned
after three months,

00:20:42.185 --> 00:20:43.265
but royal writings

00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:46.105
are cherished among the people,

00:20:46.785 --> 00:20:48.705
so some were secretly sold.

00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:52.185
I also bought some myself.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.305
This level of wit

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:06.785
is not enough for this mission.

00:21:13.825 --> 00:21:15.425
You would do well

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:18.745
to give me more surprises.

00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:24.305
More surprises, Your Majesty?

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.905
I know I wasn't the only one
commanded to enter the Capital.

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:34.305
Nor was I the first to find

00:21:34.945 --> 00:21:36.185
Your Majesty's essay.

00:21:37.145 --> 00:21:38.105
The first to do so

00:21:38.785 --> 00:21:39.865
is dead now.

00:21:41.745 --> 00:21:43.065
In the assassination just now,

00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:45.905
the assassins numbered two,

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.745
yet Your Majesty

00:21:48.705 --> 00:21:50.065
killed three men.

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:59.705
Your Majesty, whom do you seek?

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:07.225
Yan Fengshan of the Huben Army

00:22:08.025 --> 00:22:09.945
and Xiao Wenjing, the deposed emperor.

00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:12.705
I want both their bodies

00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:15.345
brought before me.

00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:19.665
I will find the deposed emperor,

00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:22.105
but Yan Fengshan

00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:23.985
is mine.

00:22:25.225 --> 00:22:27.345
How dare you haggle with me?

00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:30.145
I have wanted to kill him

00:22:31.505 --> 00:22:33.825
for 15 years.

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:43.425
Stand at attention!

00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:45.145
If anyone sees you like this,

00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:46.385
what will they think?

00:22:50.345 --> 00:22:52.265
Your Majesty, do you care for this realm?

00:22:54.145 --> 00:22:57.545
If I did not, why seize it?

00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:00.945
And do you care for the throne?

00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:07.345
Even if I don't,

00:23:08.545 --> 00:23:12.025
it is not for Yan Fengshan to touch.

00:23:13.305 --> 00:23:15.065
The deposed emperor is weak-willed.

00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:18.625
Yan Fengshan controlled the court
for years.

00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:23.505
He was long known
as Emperor Yan among the people.

00:23:24.625 --> 00:23:26.305
Now that Your Majesty
has reclaimed Chang'an,

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:29.185
he will not yield easily.

00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:32.665
He abducted your brother.

00:23:34.745 --> 00:23:35.905
He will strike back.

00:23:42.785 --> 00:23:44.545
Kill Yan Fengshan,

00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:46.985
and his head is yours.

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:49.625
If you fail,

00:23:52.545 --> 00:23:54.545
your head is mine.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:00.345
My thanks, Your Majesty.

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:07.905
In my memory, whenever Your Majesty

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:10.105
has something on your mind,

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:12.945
you always take out that flute.

00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:16.585
You have just ascended the throne,

00:24:17.465 --> 00:24:18.825
yet you look burdened.

00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:25.785
It seems this throne

00:24:26.425 --> 00:24:28.105
matters little to Your Majesty after all.

00:24:48.185 --> 00:24:49.065
Sir.

00:24:49.145 --> 00:24:51.185
Sir, please get in the carriage.

00:24:51.265 --> 00:24:52.665
It is bitterly cold tonight.

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:54.345
Allow us to escort you
from the Palace City.

00:24:56.065 --> 00:24:57.465
No need for a carriage.

00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:01.025
But I'd like to trouble you
to walk with me.

00:25:01.105 --> 00:25:02.585
I prefer to go on foot.

00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:10.185
Academician Li,

00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:13.065
don't you wish to know
why His Majesty summoned me?

00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:15.985
That is not for me to ask.

00:25:16.065 --> 00:25:19.985
Whatever His Majesty commands, we obey.

00:25:20.865 --> 00:25:22.465
We must not inquire.

00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:32.265
The deposed emperor was taken
by Yan Fengshan.

00:25:43.705 --> 00:25:44.545
His Majesty wishes to…

00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:47.025
Have mercy!

00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:48.425
You said nothing.

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.105
I heard nothing.

00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:51.945
Have mercy, I beg you.

00:25:54.425 --> 00:25:56.305
I just checked the palace registry.

00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:58.225
Among all Imperial Academy scholars

00:25:58.825 --> 00:26:01.225
permitted to enter the Inner Court,

00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:04.865
there is no academician named Li.

00:26:10.025 --> 00:26:11.065
Chancellor Gao,

00:26:13.825 --> 00:26:14.945
we have exchanged messages

00:26:16.745 --> 00:26:18.345
for some time now.

00:26:19.345 --> 00:26:20.905
We finally met today.

00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:23.545
How long do you intend
to maintain this act?

00:26:30.385 --> 00:26:32.665
Your wit borders on the uncanny.

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:34.985
Take care, or you will not live long.

00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:39.185
Xie Huai'an greets Chancellor Gao.

00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:42.225
GAO YAN

00:26:42.305 --> 00:26:45.865
Where… where did I give myself away?

00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:49.745
Chancellor Gao, you did not.

00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:55.145
It is simply that
I am too cautious by nature.

00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:59.665
I do not overlook
a single word or sentence.

00:26:59.745 --> 00:27:01.105
No need to panic, though.

00:27:01.185 --> 00:27:03.585
Under the Dingtang Sword,

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:06.265
all who come lose their heads.

00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.545
"Under the Dingtang Sword,

00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:09.865
all who come lose their heads."

00:27:10.785 --> 00:27:14.265
Were you a mere academician
of the Imperial Academy,

00:27:14.945 --> 00:27:17.065
how could you have shown such pride

00:27:17.865 --> 00:27:18.865
when faced with assassins?

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:29.665
The Marquis of Northguard, Gu Yu,
recommended the famed Han Ziling,

00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:31.345
while I recommended you.

00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:34.065
It seems my judgment was sound.

00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:39.145
Han Ziling only writes fine prose.

00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:44.105
He is not likely to survive
the Dingtang Sword.

00:27:44.185 --> 00:27:46.345
You have accepted His Majesty's mission.

00:27:46.425 --> 00:27:48.185
How am I to assist you?

00:27:48.825 --> 00:27:49.945
Chancellor Gao,

00:27:50.665 --> 00:27:52.225
haven't you already done so?

00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:54.265
How so?

00:27:54.865 --> 00:27:57.025
Since there is no Academician Li,

00:27:57.105 --> 00:27:58.265
why did that commander

00:27:58.785 --> 00:28:00.665
address you as such?

00:28:02.665 --> 00:28:03.505
Academician Li.

00:28:04.305 --> 00:28:05.945
He is your man, isn't he?

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:08.465
If ever I require aid,

00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.345
I will seek him out.

00:28:15.825 --> 00:28:18.825
To find such an uncut piece of jade

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.185
in this freezing night

00:28:20.705 --> 00:28:23.505
is worth the cold.

00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:39.905
Han Ziling is already
one of the brightest minds in the realm,

00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:43.265
yet His Majesty chose this Xie Huai'an.

00:28:45.705 --> 00:28:48.825
His days are numbered.

00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:54.385
We shall see.

00:28:57.065 --> 00:28:58.145
After all,

00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:01.465
he was chosen by Chancellor Gao,

00:29:02.505 --> 00:29:06.825
and Chancellor Gao
has never misjudged a man.

00:29:10.385 --> 00:29:12.225
BUDDHA TEMPLE

00:29:12.305 --> 00:29:15.745
Wan, when you wake,

00:29:15.825 --> 00:29:19.785
go to the ruined temple east of the city.

00:29:19.865 --> 00:29:23.145
Light the candle before the Buddha statue,

00:29:24.545 --> 00:29:28.305
and a Huben guard will appear.

00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:43.545
This temple

00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:47.585
was ruined by war
and fell into this state.

00:29:50.585 --> 00:29:53.585
QINGYI OF THE HUBEN ARMY

00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:56.105
It used to be crowded with worshippers.

00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:58.785
Those who came here

00:29:58.865 --> 00:30:00.825
all said it was blessed.

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.865
You may as well make a wish.

00:30:04.305 --> 00:30:05.545
Yang Xuan is dead.

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.225
You were his student.

00:30:10.145 --> 00:30:13.785
Pray to the Bodhisattva and the underworld

00:30:14.465 --> 00:30:17.705
that he may suffer less pain over there.

00:30:35.505 --> 00:30:37.145
You have a fiery temper.

00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:39.945
But it is useless,

00:30:41.145 --> 00:30:43.465
at least before a Huben guard.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.145
You have never taken a life, have you?

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:51.345
If not,

00:30:51.425 --> 00:30:54.545
there is no need to draw the dagger
in your sleeve.

00:30:55.345 --> 00:30:56.505
It cannot harm me.

00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:59.185
You knew the Huben Army
would come for you,

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:01.265
yet you still came as you were told.

00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:05.305
Had you used this chance to flee,
wouldn't that have been better?

00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:09.545
Chang'an is full of Huben shadow guards.

00:31:10.145 --> 00:31:12.705
I'd be caught before reaching
the city gate.

00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:14.825
Rather than make a fool of myself,

00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:16.305
I'd sooner

00:31:18.225 --> 00:31:19.505
vent my anger before I die.

00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:22.225
I never intended to kill you.

00:31:24.505 --> 00:31:26.825
Yang Xuan was the Vice Minister
of Revenue, a third-rank official.

00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:28.905
His death means something
to the Huben Army.

00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:31.385
As for you, you are but a lowly painter.

00:31:31.465 --> 00:31:33.265
Even if you die in a roadside ditch,

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:36.865
who will truly care?

00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:44.305
Anyway, I invited you here for a purpose.

00:31:45.465 --> 00:31:47.065
You have no value,

00:31:48.265 --> 00:31:49.825
but the one

00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:52.025
who corresponded with you does.

00:31:53.065 --> 00:31:54.665
I want you to tell me

00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:58.345
how you first met him.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:02.945
We met by chance.

00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:04.905
I cannot help you.

00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:12.505
No matter.

00:32:18.545 --> 00:32:20.505
Met by chance, did you?

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.625
I still have patience enough.

00:32:25.385 --> 00:32:28.105
I know you work at the Painting Academy.

00:32:28.705 --> 00:32:30.385
And I also know

00:32:30.465 --> 00:32:33.585
there is a Mr. Yu there
who treats you well.

00:32:35.705 --> 00:32:39.425
I give you two hours.

00:32:40.905 --> 00:32:44.065
If you still say the same after two hours,

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:49.105
the hands of the Huben Army

00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:52.665
will reach for Mr. Yu.

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:04.785
This silver needle…

00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:09.905
What a clumsy trick.

00:33:11.465 --> 00:33:13.025
You have a long way to go.

00:33:45.105 --> 00:33:47.305
Someone, open the door!

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:51.745
-Miss Bai Wan?
-Is Mr. Yu here?

00:33:51.825 --> 00:33:52.745
Master was about to rest.

00:33:52.825 --> 00:33:54.625
-Miss Bai Wan, why--
-I must speak with him.

00:33:54.705 --> 00:33:55.945
A life is at stake. Forgive my intrusion.

00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:57.625
Miss Bai Wan!

00:34:02.225 --> 00:34:04.345
Mr. Yu, forgive me
for disturbing you so late,

00:34:04.425 --> 00:34:05.425
but I must speak with you.

00:34:05.505 --> 00:34:07.305
MR. YU, CHIEF PAINTER
OF THE PAINTING ACADEMY

00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:08.665
Why did you come?

00:34:13.065 --> 00:34:17.865
Why did you come?

00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:26.865
If I hadn't,

00:34:31.585 --> 00:34:33.025
would you have…?

00:34:39.465 --> 00:34:40.865
The Huben guards said

00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:44.025
that if you came tonight,

00:34:44.824 --> 00:34:45.744
I would have to die.

00:34:48.705 --> 00:34:50.385
Why did you come?

00:34:50.945 --> 00:34:52.625
When the Huben Army gives an order,

00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:53.824
you follow it.

00:34:53.905 --> 00:34:55.665
Why resist?

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:04.545
-Sir!
-Come no closer!

00:35:09.465 --> 00:35:10.385
I accept my fate.

00:35:44.305 --> 00:35:47.345
Mr. Qingyi
asked me to bring you a message.

00:35:48.665 --> 00:35:51.105
He said that before the Huben Army,

00:35:51.185 --> 00:35:52.385
one could only obey.

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.025
Mr. Yu's death

00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:56.945
is the price of your defiance.

00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:08.025
Greetings, Mr. Qingyi.

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:09.985
The world is in chaos.

00:36:10.905 --> 00:36:12.945
Human lives are worth little more
than weeds.

00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:16.985
What value does that girl have
that Mr. Yu must die for her?

00:36:17.745 --> 00:36:19.465
She knows the one

00:36:19.985 --> 00:36:23.545
the entire Huben Army has been hunting
for more than a decade.

00:36:25.345 --> 00:36:26.985
She wrote to him.

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.065
I once intercepted a messenger.

00:36:30.145 --> 00:36:32.385
He killed himself,

00:36:32.465 --> 00:36:34.185
and the trail went cold.

00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:38.785
Only by slaying Mr. Yu

00:36:40.425 --> 00:36:41.945
could we frighten her.

00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:46.745
Give her two days.

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:50.025
She will write to beg him for help,

00:36:51.465 --> 00:36:54.065
and I will have a trail to follow.

00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:09.905
Yan Fengshan refused to serve
under your father,

00:37:10.425 --> 00:37:12.185
so he led the entire Huben Army
in rebellion.

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:15.265
The late emperor was too old

00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:17.625
to hold him accountable.

00:37:17.705 --> 00:37:19.705
He could only let
Yan Fengshan's power grow.

00:37:22.105 --> 00:37:24.385
Find the men I seek,

00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:29.585
and I will avenge the Liu family.

00:37:49.865 --> 00:37:51.665
-Run!
-Father!

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.305
Run!

00:39:31.385 --> 00:39:32.745
I have returned.

00:40:44.745 --> 00:40:48.545
YE ZHENG

00:40:52.745 --> 00:40:55.425
What you instructed is done.

00:41:00.465 --> 00:41:01.305
How badly are you hurt?

00:41:02.025 --> 00:41:03.585
To fulfill the mission you assigned,

00:41:03.665 --> 00:41:04.745
this is nothing.

00:41:04.825 --> 00:41:06.865
Even losing half my life would have been

00:41:07.425 --> 00:41:08.265
worth the cost.

00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:12.665
Take this.

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:15.385
Where is he?

00:41:15.905 --> 00:41:17.025
This way.

00:41:35.385 --> 00:41:38.145
XIAO WENJING, THE DEPOSED EMPEROR

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:48.385
Greetings, Your Majesty.
