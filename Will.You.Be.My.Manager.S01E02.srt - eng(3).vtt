Si Woo's a puppy.

You're the Japanese manager for our Eun Ho?

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.570
I'm the leader of the Heartbroken Gu Eun Ho Girls, a.k.a H.G.G.

These two just like a handsome face.

All the best!

There's always been a tradition with Eun Ho's managers.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.840
- Tradition?
- Provide H.G.G with photos of Eun Ho in casual clothes.

Please!

Why?

We're always starving for more since there are so little rations.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.170
Why not ask him for it?

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.100
Eun Ho isn't interested in girls!

He's devoted to acting.

You've snatched the privilege to be around Eun Ho all the time.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.080
Should I transfer to the management course?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.200
Anyway, the other managers always did so.

You couldn't even say a word to Shin Ji Ah.

I guess you were waiting for a new manager to appear.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:22.760
The first year managers always did so,
and now it's your turn.

Yes, sir.

the algorithm pushes the video to more people...
