00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.920
I told you,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.240

no men at all.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
Their arrival

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.080

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.280
Kiddo,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.400
you've got so many comics.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.240
Yeah, very cheap,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.280
two yuan each.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.680
If I buy them all,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.280
can you throw in something extra?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.080
Sure, just pick whatever you want.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Let me take a look.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.190
What do you have here?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.430
Let's see...

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.240
This handkerchief is nice.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.560
Can I have it?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.420
I can wipe my sweat

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.800
Sure, no problem.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.560
Okay, deal.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.400
Thank you.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.160
Anyone want comics?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.950
Very cheap, two yuan each.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.950
What exactly are the police asking about?

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.270
You'd better explain yourself.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.190
Those were all Mr. Xu's requests.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.310
I thought you also...

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.720
Since when does Xu Yi speak for me?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.390
I entrusted you with

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.240
an important school.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.800
Can you answer me?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.870
What about the students?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.240
If I hadn't come,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.720
I wouldn't have known you were

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.800
doing all this behind my back,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.070
using charity to cover up your deals.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.310
This is illegal!

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.360
Ms. Liang, it's not that bad.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.680
I only sent the girls

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.870
to Mr. Xu's clubhouse.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.630
The police won't find anything.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.000
How many benefits did Xu Yi give you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.680
to mess with your head?

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.470
- Ms. Liang...
- Shut up!

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.160
The police will be here soon.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.000
Listen,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.720
keep your mouth shut.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.190
Once this gets out,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.190
you won't get away!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.190
Officer,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.430
these are files of

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.430
Wu Xinxin and Liu Wanyao.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.200
Two grades apart.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.190
Were they close?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.680
Honestly, I don't know

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.270
how students get along.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.680
Our training program

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.520
is two years.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.920
They shouldn't know each other.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.190
What about after graduation?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.920
Do you have

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.560
any current information on them?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.590
Well...

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.750
I do want to cooperate, but...

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.270
But the file system

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.390
wasn't well-managed before I came.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.950
Aside from these,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.270
we really have nothing.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.630
You're not the rude type.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.720
Pretending not to know is also a form of

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.070
self-protection.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.240
They have no

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.480
physical contact,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.460
(Liu Wanyao and Wu Xinxin
actively join community service.)

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.320
but their bodies

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.160
are leaning toward each other.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.310
Their expressions

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.560
and posture look relaxed.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.120
"Wu Xinxin and Liu Wanyao

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.160
not only knew each other, but were close."

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.240
Is that what you want to say?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.630
This reminds me of Zhang Yutong and Wang Chen.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.680
Is it out of jealousy,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.430
protection, or something else?

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.000
So, another case with a hidden relationship.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.800
I need to start over.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.840
Xu Jingzhi,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.160
if I were only your captain,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
I'd tell you that

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.190
you're not the only one on this case.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.800
Can't crack cases without you?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.920
The world's not spinning?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160
I... I get it.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.120
I know we don't

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.480
do heroism anymore.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.720
- But I know...
- We don't need sacrifices

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.750
to raise the clearance rate,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.600
right?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.510
You have your own rules.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.430
Without me, you'd be

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.680
more comfortable, right?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.160
I told you, humor isn't your thing.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.680
I've got to crack it!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.000
He Ya.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400

No, I haven't.

Excuse me,

No.

Don't point at me.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.550
I'm fine.

You've crossed the line now.

you're being loyal?

Let me tell you,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.390
you've already become

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.630

What have you done behind my back?

with my school?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.180
I worked so hard

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.140
to build that school.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.910
How could you use it for dirty business?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.510
I'm dirty?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.550

Fine, I admit it.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.150
It was my fault.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.720
But those girls are innocent.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.910
send them to hell?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.440
And whose fault is that?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.280
What do you mean?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.910
If you hadn't helped

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.750
Mai launder money,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.790
they wouldn't be after me.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.910
I admit it's all my fault, okay?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.480
Those girls are innocent.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:44.840
How about this?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.720
We take the ledgers and turn ourselves in.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.720
I really don't have the ledgers.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.080
If I had them,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.240
why would I take photos?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:55.910
These ledgers

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.240
were made by Zhao Xueli and Hu Bo

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.600
to protect themselves.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.790
Mai Boyuan wants to clean his image.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.240
We can't look out for ourselves now.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.390
No ledgers,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.750
no proof.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.270
I'll be the only one going to jail

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.480
and they'll walk free.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.630
That's not fair.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.600
What should we do now?

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.320
First, you find a way

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.550
to close the school

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.430
and act like

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.870
you know nothing about that mess.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.670
I have several pieces of footage

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.240
of Mai's boss raping those girls.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.670
Once I trade the footage for money,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.840
we'll leave the country.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.510
And once we're abroad,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.480
I'll hand the footage over

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.510
to the police.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.100
(Police)

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.440
There are many ways

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.320
to figure out a puzzle.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.960
There's no easy way
to figure out the human heart.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.320
Why didn't you tell me

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.840
Lu Youliang came to you?

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.150
Can you learn to trust people?

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.910
I only trust you.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.300
(Goji berries)

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.510
Mr. Mai,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.320
I've got some stock...

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.320
I'm telling you,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.400
don't bring this up again.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.400
I'm done with anything

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.960
related to this.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.000
Mr. Mai,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.550
hold off on saying no.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.200
Check the quality first.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.920
You need to find a way

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.440
to run something legal.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.000
I'm quite busy.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.550
If it's nothing important,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920
don't call me.

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.950
Mr. Mai...

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.270
So, you want to touch it too?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.920
No... no.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.160
You think I don't know?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.000
I really don't.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.350
Did Mai Boyuan

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.350
send you here?

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.040
Hou,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.150
I...

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
This hand

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.680
wanted to touch my woman.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.920
Make this the bait.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.750
No. Wait, Hou, I didn't say anything.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.160
Hou, give me a chance!

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.790
Hou! Hou! Hou!

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.590
Hou!

Come in.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.430
Director Feng,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.160
we found a safe

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.030
in the crawl space

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.200
under Hu Bo's bed.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.550
There are ledgers inside.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.390
Ledgers?

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.790
Copies of Hu Bo's

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.510
project records over the years.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.550
Economic Crimes Unit checked them.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.200
No issues on the books,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.960
but we still don't know

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.920
why he kept these.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.960
There's also an empty safe.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.110
We suspect

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.440
some ledgers were hidden.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.550
Don't forget, there is

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.960
a lot of Liu Wanyao's blood in his home.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.590
The priority now

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.880
is finding the second victim.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.350
We've stationed people

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.400
at hospitals and clinics.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.030
So far, no news.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.960
Alright, got it. Get back to work.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.800
Yes, sir.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.310
So, Zhuang Mingcheng

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.750
set me up with you, huh?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.760
Cut the crap.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.720
When the show's over,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.960
give me the ledgers.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:57.440
As long as you do what we say,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.680
Mr. Zhao stays safe.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.640
We'll give you the ledgers.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.560
There's no festival.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.720
Who's setting off fireworks?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.160
Fireworks are banned here, right?

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.680
Let's go check.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.760
Shi Zelin?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.590
Didn't expect you here.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.910
He Ya.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.240
Thanks.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.030
What a coincidence.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.870
Officer He,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.190
having dinner here?

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.800
Yeah.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.240
Are you working here

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.560
so late?

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.200
I need to find Ge Feifei during the day,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.350
so I do delivery work

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.480
to these stores at night.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.960
What happened to her?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.750
She went missing after being released.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.790
Everyone says she ran off with someone.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.030
But I know Feifei.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.960
She can't do that.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.070
There must be a reason.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.910
Don't worry.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.640
I'll look out for you.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.400
Thank you, Officer He.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.240
Did you have dinner?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.350
Yes, I did.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.440
If you didn't, you can

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.400
have some with us.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.750
I really did. Please go ahead.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.720
Okay, I'll finish it.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.430
Take care.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.520
Be good.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.390
What did he do?

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.190
Drugs.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.200
Screwed by a friend back home.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.830
He's actually an honest guy.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.160
It's hard to quit an addiction.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.520
Is he clean now?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.720
Yes.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.750
His addiction is gone.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.110
But he just told me

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.110
his childhood sweetheart

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.950
is missing.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.510
Childhood sweetheart?

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.920
Then he has to find her.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.590
Anyone here?

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.510
Who set off the fireworks?

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.760
Liu Ming,

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.870
let's go check.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.640
Who set off the fireworks?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.420
(Hu Bo)

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.070
Nail holes in the head.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.200
Based on the DNA test,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.040
the deceased

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.270
is Hu Bo.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.510
Due to the special

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.880
(DNA Identification Report)
carnivorous bacteria,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:41.880
the body underwent

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.960
severe skeletonization.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.270
Carnivorous bacteria?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.070
This is the bacterial sample

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.240
we extracted from the body.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.160
(Phage)
It's not a common wild strain.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.110
The deceased had

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.350
nails driven in multiple places.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.510
They're quite deep.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.070
Some even left marks

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.920
on the bones.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.590
Hu Bo had something

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.960
the murderer wanted.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.400
Such torture was meant to extract information.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.830
The hatred runs deep.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.060
From the traces we've confirmed,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.920
we can prove

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.240
that at least before

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.000
half the nails were driven in,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.070
Hu Bo was still alive.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.800
Well...

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.310
Can I say something here?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.280
Of course, go ahead.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.880
None of the nails

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.270
hit fatal spots.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.720
The murderer at least knows human anatomy.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.310
Li Long,

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.750
take a team and go to Hu Bo's hometown.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.350
Yin Wei, continue on

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.240
Liu Wanyao's trail.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.590
Liu Ming, Xu Jingzhi,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.550
check his social relations.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.560
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.670
Captain He,

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.400
Liu Ming and I will

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.070
go to Hu Bo's company at 1 PM.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.070
I want to take a leave for a personal errand.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.240
What kind of errand?

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.350
I want to visit Aunt Min.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.070
Ride with me.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.040
I have a car.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.840
Ride in your car, then.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.880
You don't have to go.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.070
Then you're going secretly?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.790
Don't get it everywhere.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.200
Wanna have a bite?

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
No. No.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.430
This snack's got

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.200
walnuts, cranberries, and sesame.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.440
Just take a bite.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.350
No. I'm driving here.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.270
Alright, drive safely.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.900
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.060
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.900
(Liu Wanyao)

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.440
The show with Ding Chuan

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.280
is over.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.680
Now,

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.310
it's time for Zhao Xueli to pay.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.590
Mr. Xu, I'm here.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.080
I'm on my way. See you at the entrance.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:45.390
Okay.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.140
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.000
Why are you looking at me?

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.110
I told you,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.590
don't give me that look!

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.980
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.110
Lu Ran has been gone for years.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.240
What if he hadn't?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.760
Has Lu Youliang been released recently?

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.920
Perhaps. I haven't seen him.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.720
From the wax figure case

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.030
to Hu Bo's case today,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.960
everything feels strange.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920
If you know something...

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.760
If I know something

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.640
or think of something,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.480
I'll let you know.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.750
This afternoon, I'll go near

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.590
Hu Bo's home

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.790
to see if there are new clues.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.720
From the movements, the Hu Bo

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.920
we tracked wasn't the real one.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.480
Posture and movement

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.320
don't lie.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.270
Photos aren't reliable.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.780
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.480
Before Hu Bo went missing, was there

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:57.920
anything unusual?

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.240
He was always late, left work early,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.590
and sloppy at work.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.110
That was just how he was.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.310
I didn't notice anything unusual.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.280
He was always like that.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.000
Zhao Xueli was his direct supervisor

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.960
and didn't say anything.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.750
I heard the company's major shareholder

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.590
is his uncle.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.200
His wife is gentle and obedient.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.110
He's a total jerk.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.110
Do you know the specifics

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.270
of the Angel Training Center

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.720
he managed? What did they do?

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.790
Technically, that project should've been mine,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.000
but Mr. Zhao

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.550
took it directly.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.200
There must be something

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.640
going on between them.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.590
He wasn't popular.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.430
Nobody liked him.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.960
And for some unknown reason,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.480
Mr. Zhao gave him many projects.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Could this project

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.510
relate to Hu Bo

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.880
killing his wife?

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.030
Who did he

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.830
have conflicts with at work?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.830
It's not something I can talk about.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.240
But he was hostile to me.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.310
The girls didn't like him.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.000
He harassed me.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.040
I rejected him.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.680
Otherwise, I might've ended up

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.680
in the freezer.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.550
We get along well.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.720
Same hometown as you?

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.270
Yeah. Same hometown, bad luck.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.550
Where did Hu Bo come from?

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.760
Yannan County.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.240
Tell that guy to stop filming.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.440
Not without my permission.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.190
Tell him to delete it.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.440
Do you have a year-end party every year?

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.350
Any footage?

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.750
All of it.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.070
(Xu Jingzhi)
Call me when Mr. Zhao's back.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.070
Okay.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.910
Mr. Xu,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.640
I've asked their colleagues

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.680
several times before.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.430
What they say today is totally different.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.830
These people are so unpredictable.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.510
Hello? Captain He,

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.720
check the underground parking lot

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.560
of Wuyang Xincheng.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.350
There might be a surprise.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.190
