[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830
[Episode 5]

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.910
Brandy!

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.140
Brandy, are you here?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.259
Brandy!

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.670
Zhang, Zhang...

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.670
Well,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.780
B-Brandy went to the auto parts market.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060
If you n-need anything,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.970
just feel free to tell me.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.700
Have a smoke.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.539
Who are they?

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.150
Who do you think you are?

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750
Behave yourself.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.660
I've seen

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.640
-that yellow-haired man at the boxing gym.
-Brandy!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.570
-That's him.
-Come out!

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.500
-He Zhang from Wanji Garage.
-Come out and have fun!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.340
Brandy!

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.470
What do they want to do?

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.120
Brandy used to work at Wanji Garage
for a few years.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.050
After he started his own business,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.430
that man's been coming here to harass him.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.150
Stay here.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.560
Well, hello, Zhang.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.660
Long time no see.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.620
But what's going on now?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.150
Taking advantage while the owner is away

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.340
and causing trouble, what does that prove?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.100
Those who know you might think
you're just fooling around.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.060
But others

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.160
might think you're cowards
taking advantage of people.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.020
We all work and live in this area.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.220
It'll be embarrassing if word gets out.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.280
It's none of your business.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.430
Get lost.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.500
Go pet your cat somewhere else.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.910
Were it not for the sake of your father,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.030
I'd mess with you, too.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.210
Your lackeys with their barking habits

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.600
haven't changed a bit.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.780
If you're here today for chitchat,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.990
I'm totally up for that.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.340
But tell your men

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.220
to stop running their mouths

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.680
and bringing up my father.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.960
He gambles and parties like you guys,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.690
but I'm a law-abiding citizen.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.750
Cutting me some slack for his sake is

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.210
completely unnecessary.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.430
What are you looking at?

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.520
You fix cars, right?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.610
I'll fix them for you!

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.370
Your hands!

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.100
Hands off.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.960
What?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.980
Is this your family's shop?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.440
You got that right.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.790
I...

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.700
What?

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.280
So Wanji Garage will start
hitting women now?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.340
If you have any problem, come at me.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.270
Come at me.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.770
Move aside.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.490
No!

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.150
I'm livestreaming.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.940
-It's live.
-Put your phone away!

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.620
Put it away.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.060
-It's live!
-Who are you pointing at? -Move!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.590
-Put your phone away.
-It's live!

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.829
It's live! I'm livestreaming! It's live...

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.560
Give it to me.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.709
Let go of me.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.459
Give me that.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.380
You tried to smash my car
and mess with my people.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.100
Do you want to die?

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.909
What?

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.150
Want to try me?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.650
I'm calling the police.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.630
This isn't over.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.710
I'll wait and see.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.650
Let's go!

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.770
Did that scare you?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.909
You're hurt.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.750
It's nothing.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.030
Are you okay?

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.510
What's wrong?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.690
Why didn't you call the police before?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.300
You can consider it

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.070
an unspoken rule of the game.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.340
As long as no one's life is in danger,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.490
even if the police come,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.090
there isn't much they can do.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.350
How can they mediate?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.980
They settle it this time,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.860
and we call them again next time
when there's trouble.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.860
We can't waste their time like that.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.740
But judging from the way they acted,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.590
they clearly came to cause trouble.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.650
And you couldn't beat them in a fight.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.950
Have a seat.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.000
Let me tell you something.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.540
Brandy might seem

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.880
to always bury himself in work every day,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.740
but you haven't seen him
back in Shakun High School.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.300
Back then...

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.030
You have no idea what he used to be like
when he was still

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.990
called Touqi.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.560
Not to mention these 3 guys today,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.910
he could even handle a dozen of them
without breaking a sweat.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.640
He had nothing to lose,
but others wanted to live.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.150
Actually, with his build now,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.940
he could still knock down 10 guys.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.400
It just depends
on whether he wants to fight.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.660
When people from Wanji Garage
came to cause trouble before,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.830
Brandy didn't even fight back.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.560
He just somehow sent them away.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.470
But today,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.300
it was probably because of you.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.740
Actually, every time
those Wanji Garage guys come,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.630
they're not really here to wreak havoc.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.390
They just come to cause some small trouble

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.250
and mess with Brandy's business.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.740
Touqi?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.100
Is Touqi Jin Zhao?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.590
Why was he called Touqi?

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.470
You are so sharp
at spotting the key points.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.390
I never mentioned this.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.120
I know nothing about it.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.780
Don't tell him I told you that.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.220
So why does Wanji Garage
have it in for Jin Zhao?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.420
Do they have a grudge?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.510
Brandy worked
at Wanji Garage for many years

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.070
and eventually made it to senior mechanic,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.070
in charge of quite a few apprentices.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.910
But later, because of some issues,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.620
he decided to leave Wanji Garage.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.210
Iron Cock left with Brandy.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.980
After they both left,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.030
a host of other junior mechanics

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.710
either went to other shops
or quit altogether.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.710
It caused a big blow to Wanji Garage.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.850
Later, the two of them opened this shop,

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.710
and many old clients followed them here.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.850
If you were one of Wanji Garage,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.450
would you let him off easily?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.490
After all, when Brandy was there,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.660
Wanji Garage's business was

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.860
really thriving.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.820
Is Jin Zhao

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.490
involved in some dangerous activities?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.550
What do you mean?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.870
Things that threaten his life.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.150
Underground fighting?

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.780
And street racing

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.890
with a dangerous crowd.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.820
I think you know a bit too much.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.910
What other details do you know?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.270
I don't know.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:17.780
-I really have no idea.
-Tell me.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.460
I know nothing!

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.520
Stop asking me. I know nothing at all!

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.500
So loud.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.300
If Sanlai doesn't want to talk about it,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.430
I can't force him to.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.510
Shakun High School.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.990
Touqi.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.780
I must get to the bottom of it.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.680
Brandy, Brandy.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:38.940
Come give me a hand.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.050
Let's lift this rack first.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.120
-Master.
-Let me help.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.980
Please help us.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.570
Why is this so heavy?

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.530
If you were any stronger,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.930
you could move the Earth.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.500
Don't get yourself dirty. Step aside.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.460
Let's not
talk about moving the Earth for now.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.930
Pardon?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.640
I said you're underestimating me.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.860
Come on. Put it down slowly.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.760
I wouldn't dare underestimate you.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.600
Come with me.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.090
I have an important task for you.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.150
Pick up the screws.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.440
Come on.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.000
Let's lift this first.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.370
One, two, three, up!

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.840
Mu,

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.350
they need to be sorted.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.820
Yang,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.680
does he look down on me?

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.150
No, not at all.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.180
Picking up screws is quite a hard job.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.700
Like me, I have
no fingerprints on my hands.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.100
I just can't pick them up.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.950
A Wankel engine in a pickup for home use.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.920
Interesting.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.150
Send me this address.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.640
[Pet Home]

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.980
Hello.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.940
Can I help you?

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.010
You can speak Chinese.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.940
Speak Chinese?

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.890
I thought you were a local.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.590
I am indeed a local.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.060
Your Chinese is pretty good then.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.920
Tell me what you would like to see.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.660
Cars.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:19.640
Cars?

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.200
Perfect timing.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:22.850
We just

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.230
got two new models.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.940
One is a convertible like this.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.600
This one comes with a mesh bag.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.180
But we only have these two colors.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.380
Which one do you want?

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.710
Racing cars for mountain roads.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.030
R-Racing cars?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.160
We don't have racing cars for pets here.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160
Last Saturday,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.510
the 15th, at 11 o'clock at night,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.730
where were you?

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.420
Last Saturday?

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.110
At night?

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.540
-Did Jin Zhao mess with anyone again?
-The CCTV caught

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.680
a black RX7.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.350
It wasn't me.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.150
Do you have any evidence?

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.750
Was my face caught on camera?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.150
Actually, we didn't get a clear face shot.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.820
No face shot means no evidence.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.960
Don't falsely accuse the innocent.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.110
We just have these two cars
for you to buy.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.870
If you don't want any,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.000
see the entrance there? You can leave.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.210
Is that car at the entrance yours?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.740
What's your problem?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.460
A pickup truck specifically used
by a pet shop

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.660
to transport animals

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.040
with 1,000 HP, 2,000 torque,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.870
mounted with a Wankel engine,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.270
can run even faster
than supercars on the track.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.020
1,000 HP, 2,000 torque,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.430
with a Wankel engine.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.290
What do you mean?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.030
It can run even faster
than supercars on the track.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.290
He said the exact same thing Brandy said.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.610
You've got good taste, bro.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.540
That car is

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.860
indeed mine.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.630
Why didn't you

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.670
turn on your headlights
before the bend that night?

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.180
Brandy was caught driving at night
with the headlights off?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.430
Have you heard
of the Racing Legend of Mount Akina?

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.810
About the Japanese mountain rally racing?

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.090
I'm not boasting.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.180
I'm the Racing Legend of Chinatown.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.730
If you don't mind,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.050
just call me Lord Sanlai

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.400
like everyone else.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.480
Was it really you that night?

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.540
Bro,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.390
you're asking too many questions.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.990
But that's okay.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.030
Here,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.150
a gold card for 1 question

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.100
and a platinum card for 3.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.960
Take your pick.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.760
Platinum card.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.060
Very classy.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.750
Ask whatever you want.
I'll go register it.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.340
Excuse me.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.020
When will this bird come down?

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.050
That's not a bird. That's my little sun.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.910
Excuse me.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.500
When will your two little suns

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.579
ever come down?

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.050
They quite like you.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.710
My little suns

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.310
prefer classy people.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:24.910
They'll come down soon.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.990
Do you love me that much?

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.200
Excuse me.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.660
When will they come down?

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.630
Soon.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.190
Here you are.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.290
Your card.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.420
Go away now.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.210
Go.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.500
Then...

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.550
This...

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.150
You've asked three questions already.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.780
I need you to answer my question.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.550
I can answer your question.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.090
But about the money...

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.870
Money is no problem.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.900
You should have said it earlier.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.740
Here.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.110
Supreme VIP membership, 88888.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.610
24-hour service anytime.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.140
Ask any questions you want.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.390
What's your name?

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.150
DRUNK?

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.660
Lin Sui?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.810
You know each other?

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.790
No.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.150
We've met.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.260
This guy

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.950
just came to my shop to find me.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.870
To buy a cat?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.290
He came asking about a car,
about your car.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.150
He saw you last Saturday night.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.030
He also showed me

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.150
a screenshot of the surveillance footage.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.980
It didn't capture your face,

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.380
but it was obviously you.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.630
And then?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.130
You tricked him into getting a membership?

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.520
Mind your words.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.260
What do you mean by "tricked"?

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.200
Do you know how rare it is
to run into such an easy mark?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.260
It's extremely...

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.260
But anyway,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.460
I beat around the bush

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.460
concerning all the questions

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.570
he asked about your personal info

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.880
and didn't say a word.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.350
Am I loyal enough?

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.220
If you could be this tough

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.670
when dealing with Wan Qing,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.200
it'd spare me much trouble.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.910
W-Well, about that woman,

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.640
that's going to cost you extra.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.310
Anyway, this guy set an appointment

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.830
with me for next Saturday.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.690
And where?

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.520
He said I'd know.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.170
Did you say yes?

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.310
I had no reason to turn him down!

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.190
With this kind of rich fool,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.830
I'd like to meet him again

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.360
and maybe find some new way

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.320
to make a profit.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.910
But I really don't know the location.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:28.910
He didn't tell me.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.670
He's challenging you to a race.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.210
The location is

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.570
at Doi Inthanon.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.660
Wait, what on earth

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.980
happened that night?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.070
Nothing.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.500
I was just passing by.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.790
Right, he also asked me

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.850
why you didn't turn on your headlights
before the bend.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.390
I fell asleep.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.630
With my poor skills,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.120
how can I compete with him?

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.500
I'll completely ruin the title
of Lord Sanlai of Chinatown.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.290
Come on. I'll take you somewhere

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.750
and teach you some skills.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.740
Really? Will it work?

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.070
So this is the cat

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.990
in the photo that easy mark showed me.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.850
So cool. I'll train with this one.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.730
This car isn't a good fit for you.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.570
Why?

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.220
Modified cars are usually

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.550
divided into Japanese and German styles.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.050
Japanese style pursues extremes,

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.660
like madmen with no limits.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.330
This one is a Japanese classic.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.750
What about German style?

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.020
German cars can be understood
as straight-A students

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.080
who strictly follow the rules.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.510
So what's your style now?

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.940
Once a rule-following straight-A student

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.500
and now

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.500
a madman with no limits?

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.310
You could say that.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.100
Let me explain it to you.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.220
Japanese cars are lighter themselves.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.460
To achieve
better handling and stability, they even

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.310
try to reduce the weight
as much as possible.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.420
As for German cars,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.160
they're heavier with rigid bodies,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.310
not easily deformed,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.110
with greater inertia,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.110
but they offer stability and comfort.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.110
Some Japanese cars

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.870
also install roll bars, strut bars,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.330
and other stuff to achieve

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.570
ultimate rigidity.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.630
Come take a look at this.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.630
You said so much,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.440
yet I didn't get a single thing.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.170
Oh, my God!

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.940
Isn't this Fujiwara Takumi's AE86?

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.390
Let's go with this one.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.390
Sure! It's so cool!

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.250
Here.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.310
Put this on.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.750
What?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.830
Does this hat of yours

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.760
come with instant driving skills?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.240
Why do I need to wear a hat?

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.830
What does this moon symbol mean?

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.590
In the name of the moon,

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.520
I'll punish you.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.220
Let's go!

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.530
Get in! I'll take you for a ride.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.720
Come on! Get in!

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.670
I'll teach you some skills

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.400
that should be enough to get by.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.940
Hi, gorgeous.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.310
Looking for a spin in the 86?

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.890
-Look at this man.
-Is he out of his mind,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.550
wearing sunglasses at night?

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.330
Let's go.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.600
Let me take you to a closed road
to practice.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.870
First, I'll teach you
full-throttle shifting.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.130
To accelerate faster,

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.940
keep the gas pedal floored the whole time.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.980
You need to shift gears
and release the clutch very quickly.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.840
I'll demonstrate it for you once.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:59.970
Now let's switch seats.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:00.700
Give it a try.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.070
Wait,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:03.980
I haven't even

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.380
memorized how you drove!

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.350
You drive first.
You're unfamiliar with the pedals.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.150
I'll remind you while you drive.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.320
Step on the clutch,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.690
then the gas pedal.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.190
Shift gears.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.830
Shift gears and release.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.630
What's happening?

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.930
Keep the accelerator steady.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.910
Release your left foot directly
and shift gears.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.740
Okay.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.540
I've got it steady. Just wait.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.020
Wait, no, I... How can I...

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.410
I can't shift gears right now.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.350
Use your hands and feet together!

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.950
I-I just can't do it. I can't.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.040
What should I do? Hurry!

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.840
Do it this way.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.150
Follow my commands.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.220
I'll help you shift gears,
and then you release the clutch.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:42.830
Okay.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.590
Three, two, one.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:46.530
Go!

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.590
I'll shift gears for you one more time.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.110
Three, two, one.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.070
What should I do now?

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.820
Hey, you want to take off?

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.040
Have some patience with me, will you?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.910
Can't you teach me

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.520
the fastest, coolest,

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.280
most awesome drift technique?

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.280
Get off.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.570
Gotta drift! Drift with style!

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.420
That's sick, bro!

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.400
Get off now.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.870
Pick what you most want to ask.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.630
True love.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.660
Just help me tell

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.120
if I'm his true love or not.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.180
I don't care about all those other women.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.440
I need to know
if I'm the right one for him.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.400
Moon?

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.820
What does this moon symbol mean?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.400
If I sleep with him
on the night of the full moon,

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.250
we can be together forever and ever?

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.330
Qing,

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.790
wouldn't that make you a seductress?

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.890
What seductress?

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.270
Haven't you read martial arts novels?

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.650
[Jiang Mu]

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.950
Right, what you said makes sense.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.150
It could be like that.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.310
See? I was right.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.350
S-So, Qing,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.390
which martial arts novel is that from?

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.390
You illiterate.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.310
Jin Yong's "The Deer and the Cauldron."

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.640
I've read that one!

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.260
Its protagonist, Wei Xiaobao, has...

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.560
He has 7 wives!

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:19.980
Those women are all quite pretty.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.830
Yes, beautiful.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:21.830
My favorite is...

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.570
-Qing.
-Qing.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.470
Wei Xiaobao? 7 wives?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.350
What nonsense is this?

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.810
Do you think this is the kind of man
that I, Wan Qing, am looking for?

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.500
Say that again!

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.410
I... Please stop hitting me, Qing!

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.300
It hurts.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:44.090
Where is she?

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.630
She ran away.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.070
S-She just ran away, I think.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.250
The Shakun High School
you asked about yesterday

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.580
happens to be my school.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.250
Over there is our playground,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.850
where everyone
has PE classes and activities.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.920
This is our school's classroom building.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.020
And further that way are

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.550
our school's dormitories.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.910
Students rest and relax

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.790
in that area.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.930
Over there is our school cafeteria.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.530
The food in our cafeteria is so good.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.730
You must give it a try.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.390
This area here is

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.910
our school's honor board.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.790
Honor board?

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.350
The honor board features

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.980
some outstanding senior students,

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.630
quiz competition winners,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.700
and sports competition champions.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.180
Are you out of class now?

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.680
Jin Zhao in this photo is

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.310
exactly how I imagined him.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.170
What exactly happened

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.370
that made him give up his studies?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:42.960
You know him?

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.710
It's him?

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.910
Jīn Zhao.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.600
Jìn Zhao.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.480
Your names are really interesting.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.320
He's Jīn Zhao, and you're Jiang Mu.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.070
It's these two characters.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.800
Jin Zhao. It's pronounced Jìn.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.960
Mu,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.130
your handwriting is beautiful.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.590
If my mother, who works so hard practicing

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.630
Chinese characters, sees this,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.560
she'll surely be so envious of you.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.050
My teacher taught me well.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.320
Look at your names.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.310
One is Zhao,

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.630
so he is the sun.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.830
One is Mu,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.980
so you are the moon.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.420
Together,

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.560
morning and night, day after day.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.710
Nana.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.630
I want to study here too.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.440
Smoking is bad for your health.
Don't smoke.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.980
Then I'll smoke, too.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.160
Don't be ridiculous.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.700
I forgot to tell you

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.240
that I've learned Taekwondo

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.970
as a second-degree black belt.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.780
Just fancy moves.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.960
It's enough to deal with you.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.280
I bet you wouldn't hit a woman.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.600
Don't think of me as such a nice guy.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.020
Jin Zhao,

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.910
why have you become so bad-tempered?

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.050
My temper is actually quite good now.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.620
If it were 2 years ago,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.280
you'd have ended up in the river by now.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.220
Also,

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.430
what did you just call me?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.460
Jin Zhao.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.590
Jin Zhao.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.110
Jin Zhao.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.350
Jin Zhao.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:22.750
I've decided

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.680
not to call you brother anymore.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.410
I'll just call you
by your full name, Jin Zhao.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.040
Jiang Mu.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.870
Stop clinging to your brother, Jin Zhao.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.020
I need a partner while I practice driving.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:44.830
Do me a favor.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.870
Sanlai, why aren't you wearing

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.530
your colorful clothes today?

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.930
I'm going for a mature, steady look today,

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.060
just changing my style occasionally.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.120
What did you just say? Practice driving?

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.920
That's right.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.070
Actually, I've always

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.400
had a hidden identity I haven't revealed.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.290
What is it?

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.350
The Racing Legend of Chinatown, known as

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.480
Lord Sanlai of Chinatown.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.100
Racing Legend?

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.310
Driving this flashy pink pickup truck?

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.060
This isn't flashy pink.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.920
This is Barbie Girl pink.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.190
1,000 HP, 2,000 torque,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.050
with a Wankel engine.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.090
It can run even faster

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.690
than supercars on the track.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.750
Where are we going then?

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.570
Let's go to the driving range.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.840
Are you coming?

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.170
Of course!
Or why would I ask where we're going?

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.180
I'll go get something.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:41.830
Okay.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.110
Where's Sanlai?

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.390
In the bathroom.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.150
Then I'll wait for him in the car.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.200
The key is with me.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.350
Give me the car key.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.080
She took it.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.540
What's wrong?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.890
Well,

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.430
what's with girls this age nowadays?

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.950
She was just clinging to me,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.320
but now she's suddenly avoiding me,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.250
running away faster than a rabbit.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.050
Hey, you're really weird.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.260
When everyone was going through puberty,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.420
you weren't interested in women.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.220
Now you're asking me about this?

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.740
What are you talking about?

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.710
What did you do to her?

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.909
Did you bully her?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.790
What could I possibly do to her?

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:14.909
Let me tell you.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.620
Don't try to guess
what women are thinking.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.870
You'll never figure it out anyway.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.230
Anyway,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.080
it's all because of your face.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.139
But I just can't accept it.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.670
You know, you're

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.659
not gentle, not caring,
not even interesting.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:30.540
But why are those girls

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.929
so eager to chase after you?

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.139
Where do I fall short?

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.770
Look at me from head to toe,
left to right,

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.770
or from any angle.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.620
Am I not qualified to be
the campus heartthrob?

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.820
Except for my height.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.460
I'm going out later

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.909
to meet someone.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.750
If you're free,

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.409
send her to Jin Qiang's place,

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:51.260
campus heartthrob.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.790
Where are you going?

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:57.810
You've made up your mind?

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.060
Got it.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.140
Why would Jin Zhao

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.600
buy that thing for me all of a sudden?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.470
What does he mean?

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.510
Could it be that he needed it for himself

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.980
but accidentally

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.040
put it in the plastic bag meant for me?

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.230
That must be it.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.570
Who does he want to use it with?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.310
But

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.230
if he has a girlfriend,

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.910
wouldn't it be

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.450
awkward for me to be there?

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100
And I couldn't

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.290
keep going there and disrupting his life.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.290
It'd be inappropriate
for even a real sister,

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.290
let alone

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.190
someone like me
who has no blood relation to him.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.390
That's my alma mater, look.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.700
You also studied at this school?

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.830
Yes.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.580
You know what?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.360
When I was in school,

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.500
I was quite the big shot.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.390
Countless girls came to our school

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.990
just to catch a glimpse of me.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.810
With this hairstyle of mine,

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.140
I was like Manshi's Takashi Kashiwabara,

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.910
my high school's Shun Oguri.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.020
No exaggeration,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.960
during all 3 years of high school,

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.960
I was the most handsome guy in the band.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.820
I was just one spot away from being

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.800
the most handsome guy on campus.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.950
What do you mean by "one spot"?

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.310
Well, after I registered,

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.940
another guy came.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.500
He was taller than even the seniors

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.360
and immediately
attracted everyone's attention.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.510
These girls started

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.890
spreading the word and going to see him.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.190
This guy was

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.910
Brandy.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.310
Let me tell you an interesting story.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.580
In high school, when most boys

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.140
hadn't started growing taller yet,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.100
Brandy was already over 180 cm tall.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.870
During our school's cleaning days,

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.620
for their class's cleaning,

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.950
Brandy was always the one wiping windows.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.080
The most ridiculous part was

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.460
that the class next door
would borrow him to wipe theirs.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.880
Whenever he went to wipe windows,

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.880
many girls

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.100
would poke their heads out to watch him.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.270
I didn't understand back then

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.540
what was so interesting
about wiping windows.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.740
I only found out later

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.350
that his uniform would ride up

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:11.690
when he cleaned windows,

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.220
so they could see his waist.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.230
What's so great
about seeing someone's waist?

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.350
How would I know

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.810
about your weird hobbies?

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.780
By the way,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.770
Brandy asked me
to send you to Jin Qiang's place

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.430
after this driving practice.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.610
Does Jin Zhao

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.310
have a girlfriend?

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.300
Well, how can I put it?

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.640
Brandy hasn't confirmed it.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.820
So I shouldn't say too much.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.140
But I can give you

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.870
a little insider information.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.190
Many years ago,

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.400
I dragged Brandy to a night market.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.100
After browsing around,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.360
I didn't buy anything,

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.080
but he bought an ornament.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.160
I think the answer to your question is

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.680
right on that ornament.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:11.390
It should be attached
to a certain key, I think.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.460
If you have time,

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.600
you can go find it

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.850
and know the answer.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.540
The Association's points

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.200
stack up
based on historical race performance.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.540
Outsiders can hardly
make it into the rankings.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.580
But M-night itself is already

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.840
awash with top racers.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.060
To get into the top 10

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.580
within six months is almost impossible.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.040
But only racers who make it

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.490
to the top few spots with enough points

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.890
will get noticed by the rest.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.390
I did my best.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.210
The car isn't good enough?

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.650
It needs major modifications.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.050
There's not enough time.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.060
Are you giving up?

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.240
I still have two months.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.530
I'm going to try again.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.630
When will you and your team
go back to China?

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.890
We'll stay here for now

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.300
and wait for your good news.
