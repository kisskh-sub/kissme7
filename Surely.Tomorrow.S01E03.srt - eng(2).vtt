SURELY TOMORROW

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:53.576
-You're a journalist for Dongwoon Daily?
-Yes.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.620
-Do you really know each other?
-Yes.

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:00.499
Ms. Seo Ji-woo, are you sure you know him?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.503
Not sure. Maybe?

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:06.297
"Maybe?"

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.551
One second. Fine.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:12.928
Here, look at this.

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:14.138
JARIM APPAREL
SEO JI-WOO

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:15.806
We do know each other.

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:17.766
Then why take her luggage...

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.018
That's what I mean.

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:24.440
I had something to say to her,
but she avoided me.

00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:26.650
Something important.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.193
I don't have anything to say.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.904
Hey.

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.280
What?

00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:40.247
What is it that you have to say?

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:44.335
Is running away your specialty?

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:47.630
What I'm saying is…

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:52.343
Is this the right time
to run away to England?

00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:55.137
Why do you care?

00:01:56.472 --> 00:02:00.517
Whether I slack off here
or on the London Bridge in England,

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:01.769
it's up to me.

00:02:01.852 --> 00:02:05.481
I'm saying that's a very selfish mindset.
Get it? Here's an example.

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:10.319
Your sister and her company, you know?
It's hard to run it.

00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:13.781
Yet you're going around wasting money?
Why not stay and learn something?

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.699
You're being so damn nosy.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.083
Anyway, I have to go back to work.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.167
Let's talk again later.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.670
-Are you serious?
-I am.

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:29.672
What about the flight I missed
because of you?

00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:35.427
That's--

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:39.014
7.2 million won, first class.
How are you going to make up for that?

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:40.599
Why the first class?

00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:41.725
-Pay me.
-Me?

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.352
Yes, you. You held me back.

00:02:46.605 --> 00:02:49.566
I put my house on the market
and got rid of everything.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.320
I hate to go back there,
so I'm staying at your place.

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:57.241
My place? Why? Just go to a hotel.

00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:00.953
Oh, are you paying for the hotel as well?
I'm getting a suite.

00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:04.915
If you just go back to your--

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.460
Shut up. It's either the ticket price
or the door code to your house.

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:14.383
Your account number.

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:19.430
Nuri Bank. 345864830.

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.307
-Too fast. Say that again.
-345864830.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.562
Sent. Bye. We're not done talking yet.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:32.359
NURI BANK
WIRE TRANSFER

00:03:32.443 --> 00:03:34.903
1,121 won?

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:40.659
Never seen such a number in my account.
What the hell? What a lunatic…

00:03:40.743 --> 00:03:41.952
You wanted the code.

00:03:43.287 --> 00:03:45.247
Oh, the door code.

00:03:55.632 --> 00:03:57.051
SURELY TOMORROW

00:03:57.134 --> 00:03:58.552
EPISODE 3

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:05.350
Yes, well, Ji-woo's in my house.
Somehow it happened.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:07.978
You should pick her up and…

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:09.021
What?

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:11.148
If I step in, it'll all be ruined.

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:13.901
It will look like I'm snooping around her.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.864
And if I tell her that
I asked you to help, it'll only get worse.

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:23.744
It is what it is.

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:27.873
Oh, I have a meeting to attend now. Bye.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:34.963
These women…

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:38.092
Is this a setup?

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:42.221
I couldn't even check in, Se-yeong.

00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:44.598
What? Kyeong-do showed up at the airport?

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.101
Kyeong-do? Put it on speaker. The speaker.

00:04:47.726 --> 00:04:49.812
-Oh, wait. Ouch, that hurts.
-Gosh! Be careful!

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:51.855
He stopped me from leaving.

00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:54.066
Next in line.

00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:01.448
Don't go, Ji-woo.

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:04.326
But we're no longer together.

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.203
I can't let you go like this.

00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:09.331
Kyeong-do.

00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:14.002
Come with me.

00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:22.678
So where are you now?

00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:25.764
Me? I'm at Kyeong-do's place.

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.432
Kyeong-do's place?

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.102
-She's at Kyeong-do's place.
-But why?

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.689
Oh, I don't know.
He told me to wait for him at his house.

00:05:33.772 --> 00:05:37.359
He said he didn't want to leave me alone
in my house or whatever.

00:05:42.072 --> 00:05:45.033
You should go back to work.

00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:50.205
Where will you be?

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.127
I'll be home and lonely…

00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:02.509
One, one, two, one.

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:05.596
You and me, the two of us,
become one again.

00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:08.849
That's the door code to my place.

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:13.312
You being lonely in that house again?
I can't bear to see it.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.106
Please go to my place.

00:06:18.525 --> 00:06:19.359
Okay.

00:06:27.576 --> 00:06:29.077
SEO JI-WOO

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:31.955
A green light?

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.791
Jeez, Kyeong… Gosh. Kyeong…

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.793
Kyeong-do is such a romantic, huh?

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:40.172
So romantic. I think he learned that
from me. Hey, hold on.

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:41.215
Oh, my gosh!

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:51.934
Hey, Woo-sik.

00:06:52.017 --> 00:06:56.813
I heard you made a scene at the airport
to stop Seo Ji-woo today, you goof!

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.236
Me? At the airport? What?

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:06.823
Huh? What?

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:12.537
Oh, Woo-sik. I'm hanging up.
I feel like puking. Bye.

00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.962
Why would she change the story like that?
Is she out of her mind?

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.427
This is so stressful, jeez.

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:34.935
Hey, were you going to England
to study Shakespeare?

00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:36.478
Why did you change the story…

00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:44.236
What? Study sex in England?

00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:47.864
Are you nuts?
Did you drink all that by yourself…

00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:48.782
Do you want one?

00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:49.700
Hey.

00:07:51.034 --> 00:07:53.328
Hey. Get up now.

00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:56.581
This isn't a bar. What are you doing?

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:59.710
Go to your house.
I'll send you 7.2 million, so go now.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:06.008
Hey, by the way…

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.805
This stinks. It smells...

00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:13.807
weird.

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:15.225
Take it off.

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.269
Why are you telling me to strip?

00:08:20.647 --> 00:08:22.899
You're hopeless. Let's go now. Get up.

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.652
I'm not going anywhere! You stopped me.

00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:29.906
-Why don't you join me?
-No, I don't want to.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.826
What? Why are you raising your voice?

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.120
Are you worked up, Kyeong-do?

00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:38.498
Jeez. Get a grip, will you?

00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:46.131
I did.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.384
So, let's talk.

00:08:50.469 --> 00:08:53.138
Why did you come to stop me?

00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:59.144
When you heard that I was leaving,
did you feel…

00:09:00.395 --> 00:09:02.606
feel... like...

00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:04.900
Were you sad? Is that it?

00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:09.529
We'll talk when you're sober.

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:10.864
Get changed first.

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:14.117
Gosh, you keep telling me to…
Fine, I'll take it off.

00:09:14.201 --> 00:09:16.745
Hey, come on.
I didn't tell you to get changed here.

00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:18.330
Why are you like this?

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:20.123
Huh? What…

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.420
Hey, wait.
Hey, what are you doing? Hold on.

00:09:25.504 --> 00:09:28.715
Oh, my Kyeong-do, you pookie.

00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:33.637
You're still so handsome,
aren't you? Right?

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.850
Hey, stop…

00:11:54.694 --> 00:11:58.406
SPRING 2007

00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:07.999
Take the rooms today instead of the hall.
All rooms are full.

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.376
Oh, okay.

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:20.554
That's funny.

00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:37.237
Ji-woo, are you okay?

00:12:41.658 --> 00:12:42.492
Oh, no.

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:47.122
Ji-woo, when are you going back
to the States?

00:12:47.747 --> 00:12:49.207
When your semester begins?

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:51.251
She's going back soon.

00:13:04.514 --> 00:13:09.436
You seem to be losing weight.
Ji-woo, are you on a diet?

00:13:11.646 --> 00:13:16.318
She eats well and sleeps well,
but she's not gaining any weight.

00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:17.736
Oh, no.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.073
You won't be back for a while.
Let me get you some oriental medicine.

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:34.044
Sir, would you like to try the wine first?

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:36.338
No need to try. I'll just take it.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.356
Ji-woo, let's go to the restroom.

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:57.734
Excuse us. We're going to the restroom.

00:14:05.241 --> 00:14:07.619
Is this where you work on the weekends?

00:14:09.204 --> 00:14:10.038
Yes.

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.335
Are you having a family dinner?

00:14:16.711 --> 00:14:17.587
Yes.

00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:28.181
Oh, then is your school…

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.274
Who's this?

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:41.403
Oh, hello.

00:14:42.278 --> 00:14:43.113
Ji-woo's friend?

00:14:43.822 --> 00:14:44.864
Oh, yes.

00:14:45.615 --> 00:14:48.743
Since when? I don't recognize--

00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:50.036
Mom, Kyeong-do is my--

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.331
Oh, one of my friends is her friend, so…

00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.501
We've only said hi.

00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:05.969
Ma'am, is there something you need?

00:15:08.388 --> 00:15:10.432
Will you change the server in charge?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.808
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:16.271
It'll be uncomfortable
when we're here to enjoy dinner.

00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:21.776
A mere part-timer in a VIP room?
It doesn't sound right, does it?

00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:29.492
Well... have a great evening.

00:15:30.827 --> 00:15:31.828
Oh, this way...

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:40.670
Ji-woo, let's go.

00:15:41.296 --> 00:15:42.964
Everyone is waiting.

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:20.168
You know the chairman's daughter?

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:23.254
-The chairman?
-JARIM Apparel.

00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:25.048
The head office of Indiago.

00:16:27.884 --> 00:16:29.385
Didn't you know about your friend?

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:38.162
WRITE A MESSAGE
HEY, KYEONG-DO...

00:18:28.129 --> 00:18:29.088
Did you eat yet?

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.184
Let's go eat.

00:18:49.484 --> 00:18:51.527
Come on. Let's grab something to eat.

00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:00.870
I'm sorry, Kyeong-do.

00:19:08.419 --> 00:19:09.253
Ji-woo.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:18.388
Your feelings for me are real, right?

00:20:53.983 --> 00:20:55.193
Why are you bringing that back?

00:20:56.069 --> 00:20:58.362
I mean, it upsets me
when I think about it.

00:20:58.446 --> 00:20:59.322
What does?

00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:02.867
That I'm delivering my son
his dress shirts at this age.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.494
Tell him to get them himself.

00:21:05.453 --> 00:21:07.080
Had an argument with Deacon Lee?

00:21:29.894 --> 00:21:33.106
Why did you get changed?
Embarrassed now that you're sober?

00:21:39.028 --> 00:21:39.946
Get me one too.

00:22:12.812 --> 00:22:14.355
-Do you even remember?
-Yes.

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:17.316
Think about why you
did something you'd regret.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.693
It's all alcohol.

00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:20.987
I wouldn't jump at anyone
just because I'm drunk.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.657
I'm glad to hear that I'm not just anyone.

00:22:30.997 --> 00:22:32.415
Was it romantic?

00:22:32.498 --> 00:22:34.542
You carried me to the bed.

00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:37.211
-I threw you.
-Bullshit. I said I remember everything.

00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:43.926
Why did you stop me?

00:22:46.012 --> 00:22:47.680
You know Ji-woo.

00:22:48.306 --> 00:22:51.893
She's full of energy.
But what makes me sad

00:22:51.976 --> 00:22:55.104
is that all that energy
is making her depressed.

00:22:56.314 --> 00:23:00.985
It was hard for Ji-woo to get divorced
because of her depression and alcoholism.

00:23:01.736 --> 00:23:06.490
But if she finds out about this,
that I'm going blank due to Alzheimer's…

00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:08.701
Then Ji-woo will probably…

00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:12.496
This is frustrating.

00:23:13.873 --> 00:23:17.877
Ji-woo must not know that I'm sick.

00:23:24.342 --> 00:23:25.676
Here's what I think.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.931
This is your chance
to redefine your identity before 40.

00:23:30.431 --> 00:23:32.058
But you tried to run away again.

00:23:32.141 --> 00:23:34.101
Like you did when you were 20 and 28.

00:23:34.727 --> 00:23:38.272
New York or England, I wouldn't stop you
if you had a purpose.

00:23:38.356 --> 00:23:39.482
What will you do in England?

00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:41.234
Did you stop me to lecture me?

00:23:42.193 --> 00:23:45.905
Look at all those cans you drank.
Just enough to die in England.

00:23:45.988 --> 00:23:48.658
Even if you go,
you need to get a grip first.

00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:50.952
Is that why you came running
to the airport?

00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:52.078
I'm worried.

00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:53.287
Is it love?

00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:06.300
Do you want the car key?
Or do you want to call a taxi?

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:08.844
-Go home first and--
-No.

00:24:10.012 --> 00:24:13.099
I'm going to leave anyway,
so why will I go back to that house?

00:24:13.724 --> 00:24:15.476
It's a pain in the ass
to reset everything. No.

00:24:15.893 --> 00:24:19.355
Did you listen to anything I said?
Going to England is not the point.

00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:22.400
Did you stop me just to be a jerk?

00:24:22.483 --> 00:24:25.194
I don't believe you. It was your feelings.

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:27.196
You didn't have a plan,
but you'd stop me anyway.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.950
Your developing frontal lobe
brought those feelings back to you.

00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:32.785
Is it too hard to understand?

00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:36.289
Your nonsense isn't hard to understand,
it's just ridiculous.

00:24:36.372 --> 00:24:37.665
Come home early. I'm bored.

00:24:38.791 --> 00:24:41.877
I clock off sharp on time,
so get it together and go home.

00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:44.880
We'll talk later.
You need to change the way you think.

00:24:54.807 --> 00:24:55.933
Did you meet Aaron?

00:24:56.017 --> 00:24:57.351
Briefly in Beijing.

00:24:57.935 --> 00:24:59.228
The price is too low.

00:24:59.312 --> 00:25:01.605
It's not my company,
but it'd leave us nothing.

00:25:01.689 --> 00:25:04.608
-I think he's getting China involved.
-China?

00:25:07.486 --> 00:25:08.654
It's an IT company.

00:25:09.572 --> 00:25:12.408
They're interested in an apparel company
as big as JARIM.

00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:14.327
Besides, Min-woo,

00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:18.164
the price isn't what matters right now.
What matters is the time.

00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:21.250
If this goes wrong,
both you and I are doomed.

00:25:21.334 --> 00:25:24.253
You made me spend 30 billion won
to make a paper company.

00:25:25.087 --> 00:25:26.714
Don't make me regret it.

00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:32.428
We got rid of your brother-in-law,
that Cho Jin-eon guy.

00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:33.888
When is it for your wife?

00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:36.057
Soon. It won't be long.

00:25:40.353 --> 00:25:41.562
One year maximum?

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:45.232
How long do you think
Seo Ji-yeon can hide it?

00:25:45.316 --> 00:25:48.027
She's literally going,
"Where am I? Who am I?"

00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:51.989
As soon as the news got out, it's done.
Just keep Aaron.

00:25:52.698 --> 00:25:56.118
He's coming to Korea next month.
Let's meet him quietly.

00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:01.040
What the heck?

00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:04.251
What do you want for lunch?

00:26:05.002 --> 00:26:05.961
The same place?

00:26:06.504 --> 00:26:07.713
Sounds good to me.

00:26:12.593 --> 00:26:15.721
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:23.604
You can only live in peace if you pick up.
Kang Min-woo.

00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:29.485
They're in talks with a guy named Aaron.

00:26:29.568 --> 00:26:31.695
A specialist
in buying and selling companies.

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:35.908
Bae Jun-soo said that a Chinese IT company
is interested in JARIM.

00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.161
Does he meet up with Bae Jun-soo often?

00:26:39.245 --> 00:26:41.956
No, maybe once a month?

00:26:42.581 --> 00:26:44.083
They met at the tennis court today.

00:26:45.626 --> 00:26:47.878
Okay. Thank you for your work.

00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:57.763
You're excited because I'm sick.

00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:54.612
Maybe she…

00:28:01.994 --> 00:28:02.828
What?

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.358
Lee Kyeong-do, are you home?

00:28:34.151 --> 00:28:34.985
What the heck?

00:28:43.202 --> 00:28:44.078
Shoot.

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:49.542
I'm waiting for jokbal.
Don't get worked up, just wait.

00:28:52.878 --> 00:28:54.129
I should just…

00:28:54.213 --> 00:28:56.674
While getting jokbal,
you should've gotten makgeolli, too.

00:28:57.883 --> 00:28:59.843
-Drink soda instead.
-Too much sugar.

00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:01.679
Water. Drink water then.

00:29:01.762 --> 00:29:06.392
Hey, still,
doesn't having someone at home feel…

00:29:06.475 --> 00:29:08.310
Should I say, warm? You know?

00:29:08.394 --> 00:29:09.645
No, I don't.

00:29:09.728 --> 00:29:12.606
It's better than empty. You heard me
taking a shower, and you got jokbal.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.193
What? What does you taking a shower
have to do with the jokbal?

00:29:18.028 --> 00:29:20.948
Being a journalist made you a dick.
Nitpicking much?

00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:23.659
You've been so idle
that you've lost all sense of reality.

00:29:23.742 --> 00:29:25.327
You see the world like a child.

00:29:25.411 --> 00:29:28.998
Bullshit. And you're so grown up
that you have jokbal with a child?

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.001
Whatever. Just eat your jokbal.

00:29:33.127 --> 00:29:34.545
Where are you going again?

00:29:35.087 --> 00:29:36.630
You're not going to your house.

00:29:36.714 --> 00:29:37.798
I told you I can't.

00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:40.968
So make yourself at home.
Imagine this is your house.

00:29:41.051 --> 00:29:45.055
I'll waste my money at the sauna
and sleep uncomfortably.

00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:48.392
Okay. But get changed every morning
before going to work.

00:29:48.475 --> 00:29:49.685
We stink at that age.

00:29:49.768 --> 00:29:52.855
That musty smell on a rainy day,
you know what I mean?

00:29:52.938 --> 00:29:55.816
The musty smell? That's my favorite.

00:30:02.865 --> 00:30:06.076
You said it was a lease.
You break, you fix. That's the law.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.870
My landlord is cooperative.

00:30:07.953 --> 00:30:10.789
Because someone died here,
he provides first-class service.

00:30:10.873 --> 00:30:13.250
You like first class. Hope you enjoy.

00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:23.177
That's scary. I'm scared of ghosts.

00:30:29.975 --> 00:30:32.144
Shit. Lee Kyeong-do, that asshole.

00:30:37.733 --> 00:30:39.485
If there are ghosts…

00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:44.198
I'll stop them with alcohol.

00:30:46.659 --> 00:30:49.453
SIKHYE

00:30:55.084 --> 00:30:56.877
DONGWOON DAILY

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.337
Let's see…

00:31:04.968 --> 00:31:06.095
Gosh.

00:31:12.726 --> 00:31:13.811
Jeez.

00:31:18.065 --> 00:31:21.151
I worked so hard to get a lease,
Seo Ji-woo took it over.

00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:25.197
The well-off are worse.

00:31:34.248 --> 00:31:35.249
Shit.

00:31:40.087 --> 00:31:43.215
Still not coming?
Is he acting up, or being shy?

00:31:43.298 --> 00:31:44.550
(FOR MEN)

00:31:46.677 --> 00:31:49.054
Leave a text when you move out.

00:31:51.265 --> 00:31:55.018
There are bugs in the food waste.
Better come home before they lay eggs.

00:31:56.395 --> 00:31:59.690
The food waste card
is in the left sink drawer.

00:31:59.773 --> 00:32:02.234
Clean up after you eat.

00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:04.361
If the bugs lay eggs, stir-fry them.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.240
So you're not coming home until I leave?
Are you serious?

00:32:08.323 --> 00:32:10.659
By now, you're basically trespassing.

00:32:10.743 --> 00:32:12.536
You're the one
who stopped me from leaving.

00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:14.913
You're old enough to understand me now.

00:32:14.997 --> 00:32:17.207
Seo Ji-woo, the trespasser.

00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:20.377
Who's available on Thursday, the 16th,
at 1:00 p.m.?

00:32:23.505 --> 00:32:24.882
I'll go.

00:32:26.258 --> 00:32:27.718
But you're not available.

00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:28.635
I'm not?

00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:31.680
Check your schedule. Jeez.

00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:32.598
Sorry.

00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:35.768
Frozen shoulder, Kyeong-do?

00:32:37.352 --> 00:32:38.312
It's andropause.

00:32:39.688 --> 00:32:41.106
You should go, Assistant Manager Lee.

00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:43.108
Damn it.

00:32:44.902 --> 00:32:45.986
He's changed.

00:32:49.031 --> 00:32:51.033
He's not innocent anymore.

00:33:06.632 --> 00:33:08.091
JARIM Apparel?

00:33:08.175 --> 00:33:11.178
That clothing company? That humongous one?

00:33:11.261 --> 00:33:13.680
Why does that matter?
Hey, she doesn't go to this school.

00:33:13.764 --> 00:33:16.558
Our club's identity relies on this matter!

00:33:16.642 --> 00:33:17.476
Still, the club…

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:20.854
Ji-woo… Well, she missed the timing.

00:33:20.938 --> 00:33:24.149
She wasn't trying to fool us or…
Wait, you're getting too close.

00:33:24.233 --> 00:33:27.027
-You asshole...
-That means she's a semi-chaebol!

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.487
You sure spent money well.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.281
You capitalist, money-crazed jerk.
That's not the point!

00:33:31.365 --> 00:33:32.199
She has money, so--

00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:33.408
Oh, shut up!

00:33:33.492 --> 00:33:34.743
Shut up, you asshole.

00:33:36.286 --> 00:33:37.120
I'm sorry.

00:33:39.915 --> 00:33:41.917
Are we that cool?

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:44.753
Did you hide it to hang out with us?

00:33:45.754 --> 00:33:46.755
What?

00:33:48.882 --> 00:33:50.634
-She's kind of… yeah.
-Yes, yeah.

00:33:51.468 --> 00:33:54.847
Then there's something we need to clarify.

00:33:56.014 --> 00:33:58.767
You! That car.

00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:00.894
You said it was your friend's.
Is it yours?

00:34:03.438 --> 00:34:04.982
-Yes.
-You even have a car?

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:08.193
Hey, my father sells cars,
but I still don't have one--

00:34:10.904 --> 00:34:12.155
Are you a good driver?

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:14.992
Well, no accident yet…

00:34:16.243 --> 00:34:19.580
We should have a workshop
for our play, right?

00:34:20.747 --> 00:34:24.668
What? Out of nowhere?
Did you say a workshop?

00:34:24.751 --> 00:34:26.461
Why not? Isn't it perfect?

00:34:29.506 --> 00:34:31.925
The workshop…

00:34:33.886 --> 00:34:34.720
begins now.

00:34:36.138 --> 00:34:38.307
Now? We're going now?

00:34:41.101 --> 00:34:43.228
-Hey, a workshop!
-Are we going now?

00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:46.565
Hey, wait…

00:34:57.618 --> 00:35:00.037
Oh, I love it so much.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.831
Jeong-min, can you do better
so I can feel the wind?

00:35:02.915 --> 00:35:06.043
-This car is awesome!
-Ji-woo, can I borrow this for a week?

00:35:14.384 --> 00:35:16.011
Do you want to sit in the trunk?

00:35:20.557 --> 00:35:23.518
Nice. Let's go, let's go!

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.531
You deserve it, you idiot. Come here!

00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:41.536
Chaos!

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.541
One, two, three, go!

00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:51.213
One more time?

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.673
Wait.

00:36:09.356 --> 00:36:10.273
I'm so happy.

00:36:10.357 --> 00:36:12.234
One, two, three.

00:36:17.531 --> 00:36:18.699
You're pushing me.

00:36:58.405 --> 00:36:59.239
Ji-woo.

00:37:01.992 --> 00:37:03.160
Do you want to go outside?

00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:23.096
Oh… This is nice.

00:37:26.516 --> 00:37:28.018
I love the sound of the waves.

00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.316
It was a good idea to come.

00:37:34.816 --> 00:37:36.610
I had so much fun today.

00:38:52.185 --> 00:38:53.019
Ji-woo!

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.950
What are you doing here by yourself?
There's no one around.

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:07.993
Weren't you scared?

00:39:08.785 --> 00:39:09.619
Search.

00:39:10.287 --> 00:39:11.288
What?

00:39:11.872 --> 00:39:15.083
I mean, there could be
a 500-won coin in here.

00:39:15.167 --> 00:39:16.334
A 500-won coin?

00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:19.462
Oh, hurry up and dig already.

00:39:21.965 --> 00:39:24.092
What? A 500 won out of nowhere?

00:39:24.176 --> 00:39:26.970
Hey, there's something my mom always says.

00:39:27.053 --> 00:39:31.683
"Digging won't give you any coin."
That means you'll find no single coin.

00:39:31.766 --> 00:39:36.688
Still, give it a try. You might find it.

00:39:36.771 --> 00:39:38.481
I'll only get sand under my nails.

00:39:39.733 --> 00:39:40.734
Well, how? Like this?

00:39:40.817 --> 00:39:41.902
-Yes.
-Like this?

00:39:41.985 --> 00:39:43.403
-Yes.
-Like this?

00:39:46.198 --> 00:39:49.284
There's nothing… What's in here… Wait.

00:39:51.661 --> 00:39:53.121
You hid it on purpose.

00:39:54.748 --> 00:39:57.125
Wait, don't you recognize what it is?

00:39:58.585 --> 00:39:59.502
It's 500 won.

00:39:59.586 --> 00:40:02.505
No, do you know what that 500 won means?

00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:09.930
-A 500-won coin with a hole.
-No.

00:40:10.972 --> 00:40:13.183
It's the 500 won you lost.

00:40:13.266 --> 00:40:15.852
The one you were looking for
in front of the School of Humanities.

00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:18.355
What? Oh, yeah, right.

00:40:19.606 --> 00:40:20.690
You had it all along?

00:40:21.066 --> 00:40:25.403
Yes. I'll give it back to you
since that brought you to me.

00:40:30.784 --> 00:40:32.786
So you've been keeping it.

00:40:34.454 --> 00:40:35.830
You had it this whole time.

00:40:36.665 --> 00:40:37.999
This is amazing.

00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:41.503
Make sure to keep it
for a long time. Promise.

00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:43.880
Okay.

00:40:50.971 --> 00:40:52.389
I'll take this.

00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:54.099
Sure. I'll get you a new item.

00:40:54.182 --> 00:40:55.016
Thank you.

00:41:08.405 --> 00:41:12.826
This is my dad's company…
But you worked so hard to make that money.

00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:15.161
But I promised you.

00:41:15.245 --> 00:41:18.206
Besides, I think they make nice clothes.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.793
If you're going to buy clothes anyway,
it's killing two birds with one stone.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.257
Sure, thank you.

00:41:29.134 --> 00:41:30.302
Hey, I love the color.

00:41:31.052 --> 00:41:32.804
-Really?
-Yes.

00:41:32.887 --> 00:41:34.222
Did you pick this?

00:41:34.306 --> 00:41:35.223
Of course.

00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.602
And here.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.104
What's this?

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.234
Huh?

00:41:48.403 --> 00:41:49.237
Press here.

00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:00.248
Kyeong-do.

00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:04.044
It's a gift.

00:42:04.753 --> 00:42:09.090
Our time together that 500 won brought us.
Don't forget that.

00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:14.346
This is so pretty.

00:42:14.929 --> 00:42:17.432
It's really pretty. I love it.

00:42:18.141 --> 00:42:18.975
I'm glad.

00:42:21.102 --> 00:42:22.854
I promise to cherish it.

00:42:33.865 --> 00:42:37.160
Assistant Manager Lee, are you okay?
You're getting weaker every day.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.205
It feels like you're rotting.

00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:41.539
Andropause, he said.

00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:44.542
Hey, how about some gopchang with cola?

00:42:44.626 --> 00:42:45.502
Wow.

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:23.957
Oh, well… Let's talk outside.

00:43:27.627 --> 00:43:29.003
I locked the gas.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.339
And I vacuumed the place.

00:43:35.969 --> 00:43:37.762
I didn't do the laundry, though.

00:43:37.846 --> 00:43:41.808
It'd be a waste of water and detergent
if I only washed that one shirt.

00:43:41.891 --> 00:43:43.351
You care about Earth now?

00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:46.312
Oh. I ran out of underwear,
so I took one of yours.

00:43:46.396 --> 00:43:49.566
-And I hand-washed that.
-You should've just thrown it out.

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:54.362
It was bittersweet to live together.

00:43:57.782 --> 00:43:58.616
Bye.

00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:12.589
No questions, please.

00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:15.133
Why did she vacuum your place?

00:44:15.216 --> 00:44:16.968
Why did she wear your underwear?

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.471
"Bittersweet" what?

00:44:27.395 --> 00:44:29.355
What exactly happened?

00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:31.107
Where are you going, Kyeong-do?

00:44:31.191 --> 00:44:32.734
What the hell happened?

00:44:32.817 --> 00:44:33.735
Don't cry.

00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:34.986
Where are you going?

00:44:41.326 --> 00:44:43.453
Oh, I couldn't take out the recycling.

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:51.586
Wouldn't taking out the recycling
need much less effort than this?

00:44:52.462 --> 00:44:59.093
That maniac. Jeez,
I knew she was a lunatic. Seriously.

00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:03.056
Mom. You scared me.

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:04.557
What is all this?

00:45:07.477 --> 00:45:08.436
I didn't drink them.

00:45:09.771 --> 00:45:12.815
Then where did you get them?
Are you drinking again?

00:45:12.899 --> 00:45:14.484
No.

00:45:18.112 --> 00:45:19.072
No, right?

00:45:20.323 --> 00:45:23.076
Did you take it for refunds?
Are you out of money?

00:45:24.994 --> 00:45:26.663
Oh, it's my friend.

00:45:26.746 --> 00:45:30.917
He drank so much
so I'm taking them out for him.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.378
Your friend left without cleaning up?

00:45:34.295 --> 00:45:38.591
I admit that this is suspicious,
but it wasn't me. It really wasn't.

00:45:41.052 --> 00:45:43.555
I can never stand that twice. You know?

00:45:44.514 --> 00:45:46.516
Doesn't the Bible
say something about doubt?

00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:50.061
Besides, why'd you take this route
to the store?

00:45:50.144 --> 00:45:51.938
To watch you, you brat!

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.361
Bye, Mom.
I didn't drink any of them. I swear.

00:47:00.465 --> 00:47:02.884
Again. They're at a disadvantage again.

00:47:02.967 --> 00:47:06.721
And now, here, before the ball goes
any further in, it's caught.

00:47:08.473 --> 00:47:10.600
With the second base vacant,
the ball is passed…

00:47:10.683 --> 00:47:10.722
Be careful on your way home.
And don't fight!

00:47:10.722 --> 00:47:13.853
Be careful on your way home.
And don't fight!

00:47:13.936 --> 00:47:16.022
-Bye!
-Bye-bye.

00:47:16.105 --> 00:47:21.235
NAMU ART ACADEMY

00:47:21.319 --> 00:47:25.865
Jeez, if you were going to fight,
why did you even stay together?

00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:28.368
He always starts it first.

00:47:28.451 --> 00:47:30.620
Gosh, now that he's older,
he's so twisted.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.504
So? Did you move out?

00:47:39.587 --> 00:47:40.421
Yeah.

00:47:41.047 --> 00:47:42.298
Are you going to England?

00:47:43.299 --> 00:47:45.218
-Yeah.
-Why don't you just stay?

00:47:45.301 --> 00:47:47.428
Do you want me to stay here too?

00:47:47.512 --> 00:47:51.349
That'd be nice. Then I'll get to see
your pretty face every day.

00:47:56.979 --> 00:47:59.524
Do you think
that's why Kyeong-do stopped me?

00:47:59.607 --> 00:48:01.859
He wouldn't have stopped you
if he hated you.

00:48:02.402 --> 00:48:03.986
He did nothing when I threw myself at him.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.113
You threw yourself at him?

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.575
Well, I just gave it a try.
To see how he feels about me.

00:48:10.243 --> 00:48:11.494
If he still…

00:48:15.248 --> 00:48:16.374
I just pulled a prank.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:51.868
There should be a thesis about you two.
You guys are weird.

00:48:51.951 --> 00:48:54.829
What did you do at his place
when he wasn't even home?

00:48:54.912 --> 00:48:56.789
Oh, I just drank.

00:48:57.373 --> 00:48:59.542
It seems Kyeong-do doesn't drink anymore.

00:49:00.293 --> 00:49:02.545
Or he stayed sober
so he wouldn't fall for me?

00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:07.133
Kyeong-do doesn't drink.

00:49:07.508 --> 00:49:09.761
Why not? Does he have a liver problem?

00:49:18.352 --> 00:49:19.479
Ji-woo.

00:49:22.648 --> 00:49:25.526
When you meet Kyeong-do again,
don't drink.

00:49:29.363 --> 00:49:30.406
Kyeong-do…

00:49:32.909 --> 00:49:33.868
Something happened?

00:49:38.372 --> 00:49:40.416
He was treated for alcoholism
over a long time.

00:49:45.338 --> 00:49:46.923
Hospitalized for quite a while.

00:49:51.052 --> 00:49:52.553
He almost got fired from work.

00:49:58.976 --> 00:50:00.102
When?

00:50:02.396 --> 00:50:03.773
When did that happen?

00:50:07.193 --> 00:50:10.780
Back then… when you left…

00:50:21.457 --> 00:50:23.417
He endured it when he was 20.

00:50:24.293 --> 00:50:26.796
But when you left for the second time,

00:50:28.381 --> 00:50:29.465
he crumbled.

00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:42.770
Ji-woo!

00:50:45.398 --> 00:50:46.357
Ji-woo!

00:51:27.106 --> 00:51:29.442
You aren't kind. You're just stupid.

00:51:30.026 --> 00:51:31.986
When an idiot goes nuts, it's hopeless.

00:51:42.705 --> 00:51:43.664
Are you drunk?

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.458
Keep your damn head off me.

00:51:46.375 --> 00:51:48.002
What? What is wrong with you?

00:51:49.128 --> 00:51:51.088
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do.

00:51:52.006 --> 00:51:55.259
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!
I wondered why you went on about it.

00:51:56.844 --> 00:52:00.556
What, alcoholism?
That only appears in movies.

00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:02.683
Why… Why you?

00:52:06.687 --> 00:52:08.648
You're making a fuss over nothing.

00:52:08.731 --> 00:52:10.024
"Nothing"?

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:13.402
You were hospitalized,
and almost got fired. That's nothing?

00:52:13.486 --> 00:52:14.862
What do you want me to do then?

00:52:22.078 --> 00:52:23.579
It just happened.

00:52:26.165 --> 00:52:28.584
I just drank,
and ended up doing it every day.

00:52:29.835 --> 00:52:31.170
It happened before I knew it.

00:52:32.254 --> 00:52:36.550
That's why I told you to stop drinking
in case you end up like me.

00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:40.846
And it's all in the past.

00:52:41.555 --> 00:52:43.307
There's no need to get upset.

00:52:46.978 --> 00:52:47.979
Why did you drink?

00:52:48.062 --> 00:52:49.981
I don't know. I don't even remember.

00:52:50.064 --> 00:52:51.399
Why did you drink so much?

00:52:54.402 --> 00:52:56.112
Why? What do you want me to say?

00:53:00.533 --> 00:53:01.826
You drank because of me.

00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:07.665
Jeez.

00:53:09.041 --> 00:53:12.878
It wasn't because of anyone.
I just boozed up because I liked it.

00:53:19.176 --> 00:53:20.094
You...

00:53:21.137 --> 00:53:24.265
You never blame me even a little.
That pisses me off even more.

00:53:24.807 --> 00:53:26.976
I was a bitch to you,
but you say you just liked it?

00:53:27.059 --> 00:53:29.478
I drank because I was frustrated.
That's all!

00:53:30.896 --> 00:53:33.357
I tried walking, and I tried running!

00:53:34.692 --> 00:53:37.278
But nothing helped me understand!
So I drank, happy?

00:53:45.327 --> 00:53:46.537
I just couldn't get it.

00:53:49.165 --> 00:53:51.125
Why you left me like that.

00:53:53.711 --> 00:53:56.464
Back then and even now,
I just don't get it.

00:55:09.954 --> 00:55:10.830
Hey.

00:55:14.166 --> 00:55:16.127
If you were going to leave me…

00:55:18.879 --> 00:55:20.923
if you were going to leave me like that…

00:55:23.259 --> 00:55:25.219
you shouldn't have come back!

00:55:28.013 --> 00:55:31.100
You… you jerk.

00:55:43.946 --> 00:55:44.780
Shit…

00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:46.615
Seriously…

00:56:29.575 --> 00:56:30.534
I'm getting dizzy.

00:56:32.536 --> 00:56:35.372
I'm running out of energy
after hearing I'm a jerk.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.546
Sorry about calling you a jerk.

00:56:43.547 --> 00:56:47.092
Let's call it even.
I'm too tired to even fight back.

00:56:59.939 --> 00:57:02.441
Oh, don't look at me like that.
It's frustrating.

00:57:06.612 --> 00:57:08.197
How am I looking at you?

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.866
I don't know.
It's frustrating because I don't know.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.576
I don't know what to do with that look.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.707
It's because I want both of us
to get a grip.

00:57:31.095 --> 00:57:34.515
Was it tough? I mean, the treatment.

00:57:37.643 --> 00:57:38.644
Was it tough?

00:57:44.817 --> 00:57:45.651
Yes.

00:57:50.364 --> 00:57:52.616
Just how much did you drink
to be hospitalized?

00:57:56.078 --> 00:57:59.832
I'm telling you, if you drink like that,
there's no other way. So quit.

00:57:59.915 --> 00:58:02.918
I will. So you should also…

00:58:03.002 --> 00:58:03.919
Ji-woo.

00:58:06.505 --> 00:58:12.303
When you think about it,
we didn't even date for a whole year.

00:58:17.057 --> 00:58:18.434
But perhaps…

00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:22.146
Maybe I'm too soft.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:29.820
I guess I couldn't let it go.

00:58:31.196 --> 00:58:32.990
I couldn't move on.

00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:39.663
It's all in the past.

00:58:41.915 --> 00:58:43.751
So I'm embarrassed to get so angry.

00:58:52.968 --> 00:58:54.094
Did you eat?

00:58:54.845 --> 00:58:55.679
Yes.

00:58:58.974 --> 00:59:01.602
-Let's go. I'll walk you to your car.
-It's fine.

00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:06.857
Now you're finally getting a grip.

00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:20.829
You know what, Kyeong-do?

00:59:26.126 --> 00:59:29.338
At the time, I was too…

00:59:34.218 --> 00:59:38.347
I mean, it's not that I left you…

00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:43.644
but I left to die.

00:59:46.939 --> 00:59:49.775
But it was really frightening to die.

00:59:54.238 --> 00:59:55.948
It felt like a dream

00:59:57.199 --> 00:59:58.325
to see you at home

01:00:00.244 --> 01:00:01.662
when I went home after work.

01:00:03.539 --> 01:00:05.165
I'm sure you had your reasons.

01:00:07.292 --> 01:00:08.419
But still,

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:11.672
you should've seen me before you left.

01:00:22.724 --> 01:00:24.059
I have a favor to ask you.

01:00:27.729 --> 01:00:29.523
Don't worry about me from now on.

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:32.943
Sorry about messing with you
in the last few days.

01:00:34.027 --> 01:00:36.113
I think I finally pulled myself together.

01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:41.160
It's no longer love.

01:00:41.243 --> 01:00:43.704
And I'd be such a bitch
to call it a friendship.

01:00:45.831 --> 01:00:47.666
So I just hope…

01:00:55.466 --> 01:00:56.467
the best for you.

01:01:03.515 --> 01:01:04.349
Bye.

01:01:44.056 --> 01:01:45.807
It's no longer love.

01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:48.560
And I'd be such a bitch
to call it a friendship.

01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:53.857
Stop drinking and stop swearing,
you woman…

01:01:57.653 --> 01:01:58.820
Seo Ji-woo.

01:02:01.907 --> 01:02:03.116
Good decision.

01:02:04.493 --> 01:02:06.119
Start learning the ropes.

01:02:07.037 --> 01:02:09.706
I booked the ticket again.
I'm leaving soon.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:13.794
Do you have itchy feet or something?
Why do you keep going abroad?

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:18.257
If you made a fuss over your divorce,

01:02:18.924 --> 01:02:20.592
you need to show your next step.

01:02:21.009 --> 01:02:24.680
Is my next step finding my spot
in the company?

01:02:24.763 --> 01:02:26.348
Don't you know the situation you're in?

01:02:31.228 --> 01:02:34.314
I do. I know it very well.

01:02:39.236 --> 01:02:42.155
I guess one can't play dumb
unless they have the energy.

01:02:43.156 --> 01:02:44.616
Am I your insurance?

01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:47.995
Do you even qualify to be my insurance?

01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:54.501
No shares whatsoever.

01:02:56.878 --> 01:02:59.172
Seo Ji-woo, the illegitimate child.

01:03:09.016 --> 01:03:09.850
You…

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.771
Since when did you know?

01:03:20.902 --> 01:03:22.195
When I was 28.

01:03:23.405 --> 01:03:25.073
I'm not Dad's, but you had an--

01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:26.199
Shut your mouth!

01:03:28.035 --> 01:03:30.704
Have you been pretending this whole time?
How despicable.

01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:31.747
Despicable?

01:03:35.626 --> 01:03:36.710
This is crazy.

01:03:38.795 --> 01:03:43.675
Mom, why do you think
Dad cherished me so much?

01:03:44.343 --> 01:03:46.053
I must've been an eyesore to him.

01:03:48.305 --> 01:03:50.057
It's probably because he pitied me.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:55.103
Because you disdained me like a bug,
he must've pitied the poor, innocent kid.

01:03:57.439 --> 01:03:58.815
Let's talk again later.

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:01.443
No, I'm never going to see you again.

01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:06.281
I'm not working at the company.
I'm not going to do that for you.

01:04:07.032 --> 01:04:10.911
Dad's will that he'd give me the shares?
I don't care.

01:04:13.038 --> 01:04:15.540
You used to yell at me
not to come back to Korea.

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:18.210
And now you want me to work here
to get my shares?

01:04:21.088 --> 01:04:22.839
I'm not going to be your insurance.

01:04:27.177 --> 01:04:28.053
Does...

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:31.473
Ji-yeon know?

01:04:36.436 --> 01:04:39.481
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

01:04:40.982 --> 01:04:42.025
How did you know?

01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:43.485
Ji-yeon told me.

01:04:50.659 --> 01:04:51.618
Are you afraid now?

01:04:54.162 --> 01:04:55.247
Are you finally afraid?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.960
SE-YEONG

01:05:46.965 --> 01:05:48.800
-Yes, Se-yeong.
-Hey, Kyeong-do.

01:05:48.884 --> 01:05:53.013
I thought Ji-woo was pretty shocked today,
so I came to her place to check on her.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:55.724
And?

01:05:55.807 --> 01:05:58.852
I hear the phone ringing inside,
but she won't open the door.

01:06:03.899 --> 01:06:07.360
Hey, Seo Ji-woo!

01:06:08.236 --> 01:06:09.571
Ji-woo!

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:12.240
-Call the locksmith.
-Okay.

01:06:13.074 --> 01:06:14.117
Ji-woo!

01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:15.076
Hello?

01:06:15.744 --> 01:06:19.206
Hi, my door is locked.
Sir, can you come here as fast as you can?

01:06:23.001 --> 01:06:23.877
Ji-woo!

01:06:34.596 --> 01:06:35.430
Ji-woo!

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:37.933
Hey, Ji-woo, wake up, will you?

01:06:38.016 --> 01:06:42.270
Ji-woo, wake up, please?

01:06:42.979 --> 01:06:46.775
Ji-woo, come on. Seo Ji-woo!

01:06:48.026 --> 01:06:51.738
SURELY TOMORROW

01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:13.051
Honey, have you seen the watch I bought?

01:07:13.134 --> 01:07:14.010
What watch?

01:07:14.094 --> 01:07:15.846
The one I bought for you

01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:18.139
when I went to Seoraksan Mountain
with the ladies.

01:07:18.223 --> 01:07:19.599
FULL OF HAPPINESS
SEORAKSAN MOUNTAIN

01:07:19.683 --> 01:07:22.102
I don't remember where I put it.

01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:24.062
Kyeong-do!

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.154
Have you seen this small and round thing
by chance?

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.366
When you open it, there's a watch inside.

01:07:37.409 --> 01:07:38.660
This small? Round?

01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:40.161
Yes, did you see it?

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.831
A watch looks like that?

01:07:42.914 --> 01:07:45.417
Jeez, you need to read more.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.045
It's the kind of watch from the story,
The Gift of the Magi.

01:07:49.129 --> 01:07:51.590
The one you can put
inside the pocket of your suit.

01:07:51.673 --> 01:07:52.924
Oh, the story

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:56.219
where the wife cuts her hair
to buy a new chain?

01:07:56.303 --> 01:07:57.596
Have you seen it or not?

01:07:57.679 --> 01:07:58.638
No.

01:07:59.806 --> 01:08:01.224
That's strange.

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:04.769
Did a petty thief steal it or what?

01:08:56.112 --> 01:08:58.073
I know it's tough.

01:08:58.156 --> 01:09:01.451
Whether I drink or take pills,
mind your own business.

01:09:01.534 --> 01:09:02.369
Hey.

01:09:02.452 --> 01:09:05.121
You should stop getting involved
with Seo Ji-woo.

01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:09.209
Some people don't know when to stop.
Like Ji-woo and Kyeong-do.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:10.377
Hey…

01:09:11.294 --> 01:09:15.131
I keep coming back here,
but you're not here anymore.

01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:20.845
Being sweet in a grumpy way.
The worried look in your eyes.

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:23.264
I keep imagining things.

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:27.727
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.
