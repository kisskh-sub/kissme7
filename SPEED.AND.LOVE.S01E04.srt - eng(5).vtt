00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.490
Does your offer still stand?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.910
What offer?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.640
Letting me stay here.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.130
I'm not your brother.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.840
Do you think this is appropriate?

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.940
Yes, it's fine.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.260
The water heater at Dad's place is broken.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.920
I can't even take a hot shower.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.700
You know how hot it is here.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.390
If I can't shower before bed,

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.980
it'll be very uncomfortable.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.180
I'm new here.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.870
I can't handle cold water showers.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.150
Just one night.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.940
Oh no.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.370
Why am I so unlucky?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.640
Having my period at a time like this.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.260
I've left some clothes here for you.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.680
What's wrong?

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.700
Does your stomach hurt?

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.070
Is your stomach upset from the beer?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.310
Are you...

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.290
Yes.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.420
That's right.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.520
That's right.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.320
But it seems we can't order takeout here.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.590
You take a shower first.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.520
I'll go buy some.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.420
What are you buying today, handsome?

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.830
Please support my business more often.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.940
Do you need any help?

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.730
Just let me know if you need assistance.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.190
Did you get the right one?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.980
Would you like
to join our 10-baht promotion?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.460
Just add 10 more baht.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.910
You can choose anything from this shelf.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:50.580
It's a good deal.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.910
I bought everything you need.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.450
I'll wait outside.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.100
Call me if you need anything.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.610
I'm done. You can shower now.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.050
I'll give you these slippers
after I get into bed.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.730
Where will you sleep?

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.520
Next door.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.060
At Sanlai's place.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.800
Get some sleep.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.820
What's wrong?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.020
My stomach hurts.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.610
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.450
No need.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.630
It's my period. It'll get better soon.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:01.090
Does it hurt a lot?

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:11.570
Wait a moment.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.390
It says here

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.050
you should warm it with your hands.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.530
Then press

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.350
the Guanyuan acupoint.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.150
Where is the Guanyuan acupoint?

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.010
It's about 10 cm

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.830
right below your navel.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.180
It's not working.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.460
Press with your finger.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.790
I am pressing it.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.470
It's here.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.740
Your hands are so warm. Warm me up.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.500
Feeling better?

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.770
Don't move.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.590
Why did you bring him back?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.070
Don't you know our situation?

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.740
I'm pregnant.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.460
How can I manage?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.980
Can you afford to raise him?

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.460
One more child just means
one more set of dishes.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.840
You're making a fuss over nothing.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.910
Easy for you to say.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.430
Is it just about an extra set of dishes?

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.500
Can you really support him?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.830
Charles was my brother.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.110
He had an accident at the racetrack.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.570
I can't abandon his child!

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.940
His father was just a daredevil!

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.180
I'm a daredevil too!

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.150
You...

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.150
Jin Qiang, let me tell you.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.920
I don't agree with this.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.120
Do whatever you want.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.690
You just gave birth
and don't even take care of your baby.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.550
You always run off to dance class.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.020
What else can I do?

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.840
We still need to live our lives.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.770
I need to earn money for my family.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.180
I'm done talking to you.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.910
The baby's awake. I need to breastfeed.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:51.550
That's it.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.020
Sweetheart.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.820
My daughter is almost 2 years old

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.870
and still can't talk.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.870
I'm really worried.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.730
I don't know

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.900
if it has something to do with Jin Zhao.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.380
I just feel like

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.250
my life isn't going well.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.400
You know what I mean?

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.410
Anyway...

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.310
I've already decided.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.190
Thank you for your help, Miss.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.070
Jin Zhao,

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.910
you must listen to your teacher there

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.130
and get along with the other children.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.460
I'll come visit you when I can, okay?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.720
Miss, I'll leave him in your care.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:53.910
Come.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.870
Brother.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.430
Brother.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.290
[Speeding Auto House]

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.070
Master,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.780
why are you starting work so early today?

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.240
Want some coconut juice?
It's really fresh.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:21.700
Keep it down.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.000
I don't want any.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.090
Then I'll take it inside.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:25.750
Don't go in.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.740
Who's in there?

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.910
A heavy sleeper.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.420
A heavy sleeper?

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.910
Brandy, Yang.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.310
Breakfast is ready.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.520
I bought it from miles away.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.590
Be quiet.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.780
What's wrong?

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.940
There's someone in Master's room.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.940
Someone's there?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.500
Who is it?

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:49.660
I don't know.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.070
Seems someone has stayed in the lounge
since last night.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.660
Doesn't he forbid others
from staying in his room?

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.310
Yes, who could it be?

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.580
Snakey?

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.020
No way.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.550
Last time she came to the shop,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.730
she insisted on going to the lounge

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.860
and casually lay down on Brandy's bed.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.350
When he came back,

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.450
upon seeing that,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.680
he grabbed her by the collar
and threw her out.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.770
Snakey was so angry

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.040
she hasn't been back for a long time.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.380
It can't be Snakey.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.410
Right.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.630
Then who could it be

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.380
that he's so tolerant of?

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.570
Did it start?

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.700
Why is there no response?

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.660
No, it didn't.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.570
What's the problem then?

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.590
The spark plugs have been replaced.
What about the fuel line?

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.820
It's not about the fuel line at all.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.900
The throttle?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.180
The throttle is fine.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.150
I've checked it.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.770
Then why won't it start?

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.800
Have you checked the battery?

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.450
Look.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.970
Could it be the fuel pump?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.190
I don't think so.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.030
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.870
W-Who are you?

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.990
Hello, I'm Jiang Mu,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.480
Jin Zhao's little sister.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.180
Your car has

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.010
a loose intake pressure sensor.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.030
What are you looking at?

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.280
Get back to work.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.120
Why aren't you wearing pants?

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.090
I am.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.300
Is your stomach still hurting?

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.120
Go change into long pants.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.850
And come out for breakfast. Go.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.120
I don't eat carrots.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.300
No green onions either.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.160
Move aside.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.180
What are you laughing at?

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.110
I'm not afraid of the hot oil.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.110
I just...

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.440
It just happened too suddenly.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.700
Can you cook?

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.550
Of course I can.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.260
Don't underestimate me.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.660
I'm a quick learner.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.700
It's just that before,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.900
I didn't have many chances to practice.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.170
You can cook and make dumplings.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.630
Looks like you're quite good
in the kitchen.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.230
Don't think too highly of me.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.900
I just had more opportunities to practice.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.240
Do you have time later?

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.760
Could you help me unpack my suitcase?

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.510
All my clothes are in there.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.460
Is that okay?

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.280
Did I agree to let you stay here?

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.630
Didn't you say so last night?

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.310
I said just one night.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.860
You've already slept here for one night.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.390
I haven't had enough sleep.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.840
That's insane.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.440
I'm starting to doubt my ears.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.070
I never thought

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.660
Master would finally...

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.180
Find love at last.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.290
Can I stay a few more nights?

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.750
No way.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.780
How about 2 nights? Not counting tonight.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.940
Finish your vegetables.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.760
Don't pick out the carrots.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.870
You're so stubborn.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.280
You're not my brother.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.080
You're too controlling.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.550
Lin Sui,

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:18.980
we've checked all surveillance footage

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.110
from that night on the mountain,

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.440
but couldn't find any clear facial shots.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.140
The other cars have been left far behind.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.880
The 11th turn.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.640
Whose black car is that?

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.620
I'm sorry, Lin Sui.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.620
It's not one of ours.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.890
The road probably
hasn't been properly blocked off.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.490
It's just a passing vehicle.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.480

That car's got over 1,000 HP
and 2,000 lb-ft of torque.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.140
By the sound, it's not an ordinary rotor.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.270
A two-rotor, three-rotor,

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.500
or even

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.620
a four-rotor is possible.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.100
But we've checked

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:35.910
the largest modified car gatherings

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.190
in Manshi,

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.610
but couldn't find that black car.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.850
Then find the person.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.670
In Southeast Asia, no more than 5 people

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.190
can fabricate

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.920
a two-rotor or more.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.710
Go out on the streets now.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.670
When you hear a rotor sound, open the hood

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.820
and check one by one.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.780
What are you waiting for?

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.540
Hurry up!

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.050
Got it.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.130
Even if I have to turn Manshi upside down,

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.040
I will find you.
