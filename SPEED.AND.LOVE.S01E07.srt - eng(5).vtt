[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.750
[Episode 7]

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.139
Where's the keychain Sanlai mentioned?

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.230
Come and eat.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.520
Could it be that Jin Zhao has it on him?

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.910
Drink your milk.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.680
I don't like milk.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.820
Then eat the egg.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.210
I like eggs even less.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.460
If you don't eat, go back to Jin Qiang's.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.180
Fine.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.200
I'll eat, okay?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.710
You're even stricter than my mom.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.930
I signed my name.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.750
What you signed was a hospital form,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.710
not a life contract.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.880
If you became malnourished
while staying with me,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.280
what would people think?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.750
Finish the fruit too.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.630
That's a lot.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.100
Do you want to go back to Jin Qiang's?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.010
Mr. Lin, you're here.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.600
Who are you?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.930
Don't touch me.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.300
What are you...

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.240
Why did you get physical?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.480
What's going on here?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.520
Miss.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.250
Miss Wan.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.159
A few days ago,
your people came to my house

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.750
and tried to kidnap my sister.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.750
For this matter,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.280
you owe me an explanation.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.250
My people

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.980
kidnapped my friend?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.270
You must have misunderstood.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.150
Ask him.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.680
Mr. Lin, I didn't mean to kidnap her.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.310
I... I was just messing around with her.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.750
It's true.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.950
I was messing around.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.750
I'm just messing around too.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.750
Let go.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.690
It hurts.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.450
Let go.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.100
You've already hit him.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.850
What more do you want?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.950
If you want to be friends with my sister,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.680
that's fine.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.440
But you need to be polite.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.580
If she doesn't want to,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.170
then back off.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.460
Try that again,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.140
and you'll regret it.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.220
Hey, Lin,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.500
what do you mean?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
Have you decided?

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.360
You're staying here to study?

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.310
But

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.190
I need to find

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.140
a legitimate reason to stay here.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.650
Since my mom insists I go abroad,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.550
going to Canada or staying here

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.700
is the same.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.220
Comparatively speaking,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.630
I prefer your country.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.970
It's warm and diverse.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.430
That's great, Mu.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.990
Which university
are you going to apply to?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.300
I haven't decided yet.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.110
I'm not good at languages.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.260
I might need to sign up
for a language foundation course first.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.140
What a coincidence!

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.740
My family runs
a language training institute.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.220
We specialize
in less commonly taught languages.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.950
Really?

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.390
Would you like to sign up
for my family's courses?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.650
I can go and take a look.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.110
This way.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:52.630
This is the language training school

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.820
I told you about.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.070
It's so big.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.700
Of course. My family owns it.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.370
Let's go. I'll help you enroll.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.340
That's great.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.150
[Student Affairs Office]

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.080
Welcome to join us.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.130
See you in class in a few days.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.090
Mu.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.000
Thank you.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.700
You already have some language foundation,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.140
so I enrolled you
in an intermediate class.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.600
This class, which is medium-sized,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.550
mainly consists of Chinese, foreigners,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.070
and Chinese nationals

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.930
who are studying abroad like you.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.890
Come this way.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.340
But listen,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.910
to master a language,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.630
besides taking the foundation course,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.159
the most important thing is

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.780
to communicate frequently

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.240
with local people like us.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.890
But you always speak Chinese.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.870
I've never heard you speak
the local language.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.550
Don't worry.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.070
Don't overthink it.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.950
What do they mean?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.110
Don't worry. Don't overthink it.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.870
Don't worry.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.040
Don't worry.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.470
Come on, repeat after me.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.270
Don't worry.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.710
Don't wo-

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.220
-rry.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.460
Don't overthink it. Lift your tone.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.330
Don't overthink it.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.320
Right. Now say them all together.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.920
Don't worry. Don't overthink it.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.430
Very good!

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.700
I can speak it too.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.310
Go ahead.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.900
So beautiful.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.990
So beautiful.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.260
Thank you.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.430
Right. Thank you.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.060
What else?

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.950
Also...

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.840
Gently, gently.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.580
You get massages quite often, don't you?

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.340
What else?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.220
Kiss.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.410
-Kiss?
-Kiss.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.020
-Kiss. Kiss.
-Kiss.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.330
It’s almost time for the race.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.960
Is your car ready?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.020
It still needs two important parts.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.390
I can't find them anywhere in the city.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.250
You're probably being targeted.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.070
You have to tough it out this time.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.190
I have confidence.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.340
This race is crucial.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.700
If you're placed in the top 3,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700
you'll get into the top 10 by points.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.760
The door is closed.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.310
Doesn't he know you're coming back today?

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.110
He definitely did it on purpose.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.460
He just doesn't want me to live here.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.510
This guy

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.950
doesn't know how to treat a lady at all.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.170
Exactly.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.480
Why don't you stay at my place?

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.470
My mom would love you.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.700
Never mind, Nana.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.580
I'd better go back to my dad's place.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.190
I need him to talk with my mom

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.740
about follow-up.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.000
Alright. I'll take you there.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Thanks, Nana.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.420
Dad?

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:58.900
Dad, open the door!

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.620
You stepped on my hand.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.580
I didn't even cry out in pain.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.260
Why did you shout?

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.070
Dad?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.720
Dad, it's really you.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.850
Why are you sleeping here?

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.820
It's nice here. It's cool.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.720
Why did you drink so much again?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.740
Let's go.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.540
Let's go home. Don't sleep here.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.500
The electrical circuit at home
is burned out.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.700
There's no electricity.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.690
The air conditioner is not working.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.030
Why don't you fix it?

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.770
I can't be bothered to fix it.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.070
You can ask Jin Zhao to fix it.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.030
Let's go. Don't sleep here.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.170
This place has too many mosquitoes
and is not safe.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.290
Get up.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.100
Get up.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.400
Mrs. Zhao, where did you go?

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.220
I took Xin to the countryside.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.240
We're going back tomorrow.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.040
What's wrong?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.620
You're going back to live?

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.010
The key

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.050
is under the flowerpot by the door.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.950
Open the door and let yourself in.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.220
No. My father fell asleep
next to garbage bins.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.350
I can't drag him away. What should I do?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.420
He did it again?

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.310
Just ignore him.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.390
He sleeps everywhere.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.390
Just leave him be.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.050
No way.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.500
He... He can't sleep here.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.700
It's not safe,
and there are too many mosquitoes.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.190
Alright, leave him be.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.960
When he sobers up, he'll go home.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.750
Okay, I'll hang up now.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.760
Dad, wake up.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.220
Don't sleep here.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.740
Wake up.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.050
What are you doing?

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.780
Where did you go?

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.110
I went out to take care of something.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.210
Are you

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.740
planning to let him sleep here tonight?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.420
You even made a careful preparation.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.740
What else could I do?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.500
Dad is completely drunk.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.070
I can't drag him away.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.620
If I don't cover him,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.420
he'll get bitten by mosquitoes.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.690
He's immune to mosquitoes.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.050
Let's go home.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.040
Be careful.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.230
Is Dad always like this?

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.060
Yes.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.490
Why doesn't Mrs. Zhao
do anything about it?

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.660
When he craves alcohol,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.620
he drinks himself unconscious.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.220
He sleeps wherever he drops.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.600
He's smart this time.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.540
Dad.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.630
How did he become like this?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.780
When he wakes up, ask him yourself.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.810
Why aren't the lights on?

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.020
The electrical circuit is burned out.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.150
Dad said he can't be bothered to fix it.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.590
Wait.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.680
I just bought this flashlight.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.560
Here you go.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.380
Do you need my help?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.840
Is it fixed?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.290
Turn off the lights.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.450
I need to get some sleep.
Turn off the lights.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.900
You smell terrible.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.470
Come. Go take a shower.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.190
Get up.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.960
Mu.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.500
Zhao.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.440
My good children.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.370
I

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.040
owe you an apology.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.700
I'm not a good father.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.710
You're drunk. Stop talking nonsense.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.030
I'm happy that Mu is here.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.900
Don't leave anymore.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.130
I'll take care of you.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.670
I'll buy you delicious food.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.860
I'll cook for you.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:26.940
After drinking coffee this late,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.740
aren't you afraid
you won't be able to fall asleep?

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.500
I'm not going to sleep tonight anyway.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.670
You're going to work again?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.070
I'm going to Qingshi.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.770
Are there still flights available now?

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.560
I'm driving there.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.220
Driving at night is dangerous.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.310
I'm used to it. You should get some rest.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.990
For the next few days,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.140
stay home with Jin Qiang.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.190
A few days?

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.300
You'll be gone for several days?

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:03.950
Yes.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.609
I'm going to find a part.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.020
There's no one at the garage.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.950
You don't need to look for me there.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.010
I'm leaving now.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.630
I actually had some good news to tell you.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.859
I'm leaving at 10:30.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.040
What's the good news? Tell me.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.010
I plan to stay here

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.760
and apply to a school here.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.590
Nana has already helped me sign up

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.520
for a language foundation course.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.660
Have you thought it through?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.080
Do you want me to stay?

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.280
Going to Canada with your mother

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.200
would definitely be better
than staying here.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.410
You've seen what it's like here.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.110
It's not as good as you imagined.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.460
No.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.330
I think it's pretty good here.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.700
It's even

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.950
better than I imagined.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.410
What do you mean?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.720
I'm not telling you.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.050
You have many secrets.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.490
Not as many as yours.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.470
You're the best at back talk.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.740
My business is nothing but trouble.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.490
It's better if you don't know.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.220
How about

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.390
we exchange secrets?

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.630
Tell me a bad secret,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:03.830
and I'll tell you a good...

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.160
Let's talk another day.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.530
I really have to go.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.330
Do you have enough money?

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.090
Yes.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
Eat meals on time.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.230
I'm a fussy eater.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.060
I don't like the food outside.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.630
Actually,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.870
you can ask Jin Qiang to cook for you.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.150
As you know,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.530
he's good at cooking.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.880
Come back soon.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.520
I'll try.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.730
Money isn't what I want.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.690
Dad,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.990
can you do me a favor?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.630
The environment and atmosphere here
are great,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.090
and the school is good too.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.840
I've already found a language class.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.600
It'll take about 3 or 4 months.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.060
Dad knows about it, and he agrees.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.580
Okay. I agree.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.210
Did you hear that?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.550
Dad said he agrees.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.020
I don't want to talk about Jin Zhao
with you.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.450
Alright, I'm tired.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.380
I'm going to bed.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.800

I'm hungry.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.370

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.730
I'm ranked in the top 10 in points.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.510
Come here.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.520
This is my cousin's garage.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.940
It's so luxurious.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.820
Feel free to look around.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.110
Why does this place smell like a hospital?

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.500
It must be the disinfectant.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.450
My cousin is a neat freak.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:52.870
He made the whole garage

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.270
look like a sterile ward.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.280
And over there.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.670
This girl.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.070
Why is she here?

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.630
This is a 1999 GTR34.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.410
I only saw it in movies.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.180
Mu, you know quite a lot.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.310
It's nothing special.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.870
My cousin treasures these cars so much.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.520
Outsiders aren't even
allowed to touch them.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.040
But you

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.790
can feel free to touch them.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.980
Really?

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.700
Yes.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.170
Then I won't hold back.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.920
This car's pedal is so tiny

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.260
and delicate.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.260
My cousin must have modified it.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.420
My cousin is extremely meticulous.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.670
He's a perfectionist
when it comes to modifying cars.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.280
He's super demanding.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.040
I'll take the call.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.150
One really shouldn't talk
behind people's backs.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.480
It's my cousin calling.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.390
Sui.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.460
Where are you?

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.260
I'm grocery shopping with my mom.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.590
Um, uh...

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.750
How much is half a kilo of cilantro?

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.220
Do you still want

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.360
the guitar you liked last time?

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.020
You're giving it to me?

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.740
Meet me within 5 minutes,

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.390
and the guitar is yours.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.570
5 minutes?

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.200
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:25.930
Wait for me.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.980
Mu, I'm going to get a guitar.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.670
I'll be right back.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.220
Wait for me.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.620
Feel free to look around.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.560
Nana?

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.270
Nana?

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:49.630
Nana?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.850
Nana?

00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.840
Na...

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:02.890
It's you again.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.680
Which racing team sent you?

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.170
What racing team?

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.620
You used Nana to get close to me.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.970
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.820
What's in it for me?

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.920
You should be answering my questions,

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.540
not asking me your own.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.130
What if I don't answer?

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.190
Then you're

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.480
not leaving here today.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.060
What's your reason for taking photos here?

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.670
Tell me. I want to know.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.060
I was just curious,

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.320
so Nana brought me here to look around.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.790
But after looking around,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.500
I'm not that impressed.
There's nothing special.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.880
Then tell me,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.540
what is special?

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:54.980
My friend

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.020
has a Wankel engine.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:58.490
It's really impressive.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.590
A Wankel engine?

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.720
Your friend has one?

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:03.870
Yes.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.640
Anyway, it's none of your business.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.170
Let me out. I want to go home.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.590
Get in.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.700
Where are we going?

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.740
I'll take you out.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.110
Where's Nana?

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.540
She's fine.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.950
Don't you like this car?

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.620
I'll take you for a spin.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.530
What did you take pictures of just now?

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.940
What pictures?

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.910
I have surveillance cameras.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.660
The pedal.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.830
It looks tiny,

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.770
light, and elegant.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.350
A light clutch is easy to operate.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.300
Faster coupling reduces time loss.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.390
This, in turn,
leads to better performance.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.230
It's a simple principle.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.480
I also drove a car a few days ago.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.810
Its clutch was huge and stiff.
It was really hard to control.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.790
Was it a pickup truck?

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.320
How do you know?

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.350
The stiff clutch is caused by
its hard springs.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.500
It enables a quick connection

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.909
between the engine and transmission
when shifting.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.270
Locally, only pickup enthusiasts

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.020
use hard springs.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.480
Stomping on it to shift is too rude.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.760
You shift quickly too,

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.469
but your clutch isn't stiff.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.139
Every car has its own performance balance.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.250
How to modify it

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.449
depends on the owner's preference.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.100
That's the meaning for us car enthusiasts.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.230
The same car model

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.060
holds endless possibilities.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.750
Besides,

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.370
elegance and performance

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.490
aren't mutually exclusive.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.260
But

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.330
I hate rudeness.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.630
I look better than the car?

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.180
No. Don't get the wrong idea.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.580
It's just that the way you drive

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.860
reminds me of someone.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:24.970
Your friend

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.440
with a Wankel engine?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.870
Yes.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.380
You both seem

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.870
very relaxed.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.140
Where do you live?

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.430
I'll drive you home.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.200
No need.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.150
Just drop me off at the service area.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.150
I'll take a taxi.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.970
Until you tell me the address,

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.230
I'm not letting you out.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.660
You're the first person
who dared to slam my car door.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.230
If you dare to make me angry again,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.250
I might become the first person

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.330
to smash your car.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.520
Okay.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.990
I'll give you that chance next time.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.910
Is this

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.100
a Sichuan restaurant?

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.340
I really like Chinese food.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.840
Sorry.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.640
They only sell dumplings here,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.660
and it's just that one type

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.460
with extremely salty
pickled vegetable filling.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.830
Zhao.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.130
I have something to tell you.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.130
Jin Qiang's

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.100
eldest daughter seems to be
in a relationship.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.020
Jiang Mu?

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.890
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.060
I hope

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.720
nothing goes wrong. Otherwise,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.570
how would I explain it to her mother?

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.700
You're close to her.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.660
How about

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.000
you talk to her

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.870
and find out what happened?

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.390
What did you see?

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.630
A man

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.470
just drove her back in a sports car.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.870
And he's still there,

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.970
talking nonstop.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.240
Are you sure?

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.200
Of course.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.750
I have sharp eyes.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:47.910
I knew.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.850
Zhao, listen to me.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.310
Have a good talk with her.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.060
This girl seems quite stubborn.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.320
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come here

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.950
instead of going abroad
like her mother wanted.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.700
When you talk to her,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.800
be careful about your approach.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.870
Okay.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.190
I'll talk to her.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.880
You seem

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.190
very familiar with this place.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:04.420
What do you usually do here?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.130
What nonsense are you thinking about?

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.670
No. I was just asking.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.370
Have you ever thought about

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.590
what kind of person you'd like to marry
in the future?

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.430
No, I haven't.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.360
Why did you ask this?

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.630
I was just asking.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.270
When I was in school,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.980
a guy in my class

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.050
chased a girl from another class

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.050
pretty actively.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.720
He brought her food in the morning
and drinks in the afternoon.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.120
He also gave her gifts constantly.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.650
He was such a smooth talker.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.780
He had her wrapped around his finger.

But behind her back,

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.020
he talked to us about

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.640
things too vulgar to repeat.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.670
He even shared intimate details about them

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.730
as something to brag about.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.760

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.940
The girl's grades dropped off.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.900
Her family came to school
and made a scene.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.980
The boy broke up with her.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.640
The girl couldn't accept it.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.510
She took pills

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.480
and attempted suicide.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.140
What do you think?

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.270
Well, but...

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.060
There was no need to attempt suicide.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.350
At your age,

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.100
a boy's attraction to a girl

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.080
is mostly just a passing fancy.
