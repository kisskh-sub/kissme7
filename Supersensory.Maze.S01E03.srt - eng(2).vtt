00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.480
We asked Zheng Xintao's ex-girlfriend

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.320
in the afternoon.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.350
Do you know how many came?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.880
Eight.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.430
These are willing to cooperate with us.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.020
He is a complete jerk.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.330
I'm so angry that my teeth itch.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.240
Come on, look at me.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.040
You seem pretty calm.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.880
Not in a rush?

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.870
At least we can be sure

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.760
that the victim was

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.520
a photography enthusiast.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340
The case was released online.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.710
Someone posted

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.550
an article online,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.530
combining the case info

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.470
with the plot

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.510
from Chen Danling's book.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.280
Once that article was published,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.400
Chen Danling's book

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.680

(Wuyang Angler Triggers

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.570
You posted the article, right?

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.800
How did you know

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.120
which details of the case

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.400
matched the plot

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.280
in your book?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.910
Did you kill him?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.120
I admit it.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.120
I don't know what Zheng Xintao

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.250
has ever photographed of me.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.350
I might've said some emotional things

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.110
because of those erotic photos,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.710
but these photos

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.360
concern a woman's self-esteem.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.000
I believe you can understand.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.360
I am just here to cooperate with you.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.190
I am not a murderer turning myself in.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.590

On the night of March 20

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.520
and the night of March 22,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.710
where were you?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.080
What did you do?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.680
This is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.900
the time when Zheng Xintao was killed?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.080
Answer the question.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800
It happened more than a month ago.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.310
I can't remember anything.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.190
Can't you check the location data?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.400
I need you to help me recall

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.080
where I was and what I did back then.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.030
Chen Danling.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.850
Even if she isn't the murderer,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.910
she must know something.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.360
She knows we suspect her

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.510
and still has this attitude.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.800
Is she covering for someone?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.190
She enjoys the feeling
of being treated as a suspect.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.590
Then she'll write that feeling

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.680
into her next book.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.360
What is this called?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.470
A histrionic personality.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.690
Mr. Xu talked about it before.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.320
Captain He,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.600
the murderer came.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.950
Mr. Xu,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.890
(Criminal Investigation)
she asked to see you.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.200
Officer Xu,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.470
I want to confess.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.240
It has nothing to do with Chen Danling.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.160
I killed him.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.560
He has filmed many

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.920
indecent photos of Chen Danling.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.020
Chen Danling asked me to get them back.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.310
Where are those photos?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.360
Zheng Xintao refused to return it,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.750
drugged me,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.160
and took my photos to threaten me.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.230
Chen,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.920
do you want to betray me

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.760
with him?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.520
Do you think it's worth it

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.720
for a man?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.750
He harmed so many people

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.560
and made Chen Danling
misunderstand me.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.060
Only his death can make

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.930
(Portable Gas Cylinder)
everything disappear.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.360
No one else will be harmed then.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.480
I invited Zheng Xintao to my home.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680
After getting him drunk,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.750
I killed him,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.870
hid him inside the wax figure,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.560
and asked the publishing house's driver

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.890
to dump the wax figure

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.000
at a high price.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.560
So, you killed him

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.630
out of a sense of justice?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.150
Yes.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.560
He hurt so many girls

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.040
and toyed with their feelings.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.560
He even dared to violate me.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.390
How dare he do that!

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.040
Why did you go to such great lengths

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.360
to seal him in a wax figure?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.120
He was already dead.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.390
There was no need to make him

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.610
look so pitiful.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.120
According to what you say,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.950
wasn't his pitiful state caused by you?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.190
Those girls he hurt

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.160
are even more pitiful.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.360
I am the murderer.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.420
(Wang Chen)

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.670
It was the first time Xiao Lei
felt grateful to fate.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.360
Though he had no parents,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.630
no family,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.070
and no money,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.920
at least he had

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.040
a healthy body.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.190
When he was in the orphanage,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.510
he often saw...

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.710
Mr. Xu,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.160
we've checked

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.270
Wang Chen's office before.

(Top 10 Rising Star Editors, Wang Chen)

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.040
The witness's eyes

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.980
can't be easily trusted,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.870
let alone the witness's words.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.520
Mr. Xu,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.070
you mean

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.050
Wang Chen is not the murderer?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.470
She uses the mouse with her left hand.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.160
Mr. Xu,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.450
any problem with this photo?

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.040
It seems to have been cropped.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.880
Of course.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.800
It was surely cropped.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.640
Surely.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.750
I didn't expect Chen Danling
and Wang Chen

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.160
to have known each other years ago.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.870
Stop asking.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.630
I have nothing more to say.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.510
(Moyun Press)
She's displaying

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.160
a cropped photo.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.360
Given their relationship,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.480
they could take a photo

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.870
without anyone else in it anytime.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.230
That's right.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.140
What does that indicate?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.440
It indicates these three

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.280
were once close.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.320
They had times worth remembering.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.910
This is your statement.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.920
Take a look.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.440
If you have no objections,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.840
sign your name.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.620
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.470
The murderer uses the right hand.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.750
Why did you suddenly come?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.920
This is for you.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.230
Is this to make up for standing me up

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.870
at Chen Danling's book club?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.220
I also have a gift for you.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.720
I didn't expect that you would

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.920
also prepare a painting for me.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.160
Did you paint it yourself?

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.720
Over time,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.550
you start to like the things she likes.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.390
You

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.080
paint so well.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.150
My painting looks quite ordinary

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.490
when placed next to yours.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.320
I drew casually.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.930
You learned it deliberately.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.240
I really like your gift.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.560
Really?

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.870
That's great.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280
What a pity.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.120
I have no ingredients today.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.080
Otherwise, I could cook

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.810
for the person I like.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.030
It's okay.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.390
I'll invite you to my home next time.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.300
It's not the right time.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.390
That day will come.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.600
You're different from other men.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.200
Why did you come here?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.790

Xu,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.630
only three people are related

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.830
to Zheng Xintao and have been

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.970
to Chen Danling's book club.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.960
Also, someone named Liang Xinyue,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.790
director of an art museum,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.690
maintained a close relationship

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.620
with Zheng Xintao.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.120
She's been unwilling to cooperate.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.750
Here's her info.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.210
The tech dpt. hasn't produced results?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.590
We were just scheduled yesterday.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.830
And there are so many things.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.730
What about Chen Danling?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.750
After she went back,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.750
she's been in seclusion

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.600
at home writing.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.720
She doesn't seem to care

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.270
about Wang Chen turning herself in.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.200
We've been making inquiries

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.150
and found out

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.030
that Wang Zhe and Wang Chen

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.460
are in a romantic relationship

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.870
but have not made it public,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.200
so Wang Chen,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.680
who has easy access to the wax figure,

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.180
can't yet be ruled out as a suspect.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.790
In addition,

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.750
Zheng Xintao has dozens of addresses.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.320
We're still looking

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.260
for the erotic photos.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.750
Our first meeting

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.870
was at Ms. Chen's

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.710
book signing event.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.480
He was holding a camera

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.800
and took a picture of me.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.150
In all my life,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.480
it was the first time I realized

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.390
that in front of the camera,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.890
I could look so beautiful.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.000
I have never seen

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.910
someone as friendly,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.200
handsome,

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.750
and talented as him.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.350
Thanks.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.360
- He even said...
- Low-fat.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.200
Sorry.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.390
Low-fat and low-calorie.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.750
He even said I look good.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.600
How could such beautiful eyes

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.750
be covered?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.630
Zheng Xintao said that, right?

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.270
I saw you at the book club.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.160
You are looking

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.380
for Zheng Xintao, right?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.390
But you two never dated.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.080
We were in a relationship.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.870
He was just too busy

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.720
to reply to my messages.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.030
Look.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.270
I have many photos of him.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.630
Handsome.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.920
Handsome.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.030
Handsome.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.870
Wait.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.050
(No. 62 Jiangzhong Jingyuan)
Candid shots feel great, right?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.840
Handsome.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.350
Hello, who are you two looking for?

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.510
Hello, is Chen Danling at home?

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.670
Ms. Chen is writing.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.790
She told me

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.790
she can't be interrupted.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.170
(Police)
We are police officers.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.920
Sorry.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.440
What do you need?

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.200
We'd like to learn more

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.080
about Wang Chen.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.710
Please have a seat.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.200
The house is beautiful.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.470
Thank you.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.900
Was it a gift from Zheng Xintao?

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.300
Zheng Xintao's financial situation

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.720
is quite good.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.000
Sometimes, he insisted

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.120
on giving me some things.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.790
I actually didn't want them.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.030
I could afford to buy them myself.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.270
Have you ever been

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.120
to his other houses

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720
in Wuyang with him?

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.960
I...

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.160
What about Wang Chen?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.000
You seem to be unclear

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:06.840
about what she did,

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.240
nor do you care about how she is now.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.080
I think it should be

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.000
the nature of an author.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.000
Authors are quite rational.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.910
If she really broke the law,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.870
she must face legal sanctions.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.510
It's no use for me to worry about her.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.320
Oh, right.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.320
Where is Officer Xu from last time?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.920
What a coincidence.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.360
He is investigating

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.600
Zheng Xintao's exes.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.150
Those who have been

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.080
to your book club.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.260
(Trickling Source)

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.040
Hello,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.680
I'm Xu Jingzhi.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.700
(Police)
We had an appointment.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.950
It's not easy to meet you.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.270
Is it about Zheng Xintao?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.440
Yes.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.080
We've lost touch for a long time.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.080
I'm married now.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.030
Do not involve my family.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.040
Okay.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.630
When you were dating,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.120
what kind of man was he?

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.640
A man who pretended to be perfect

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.920
in front of women,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.010
always trying to make up

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.090
for the confidence he couldn't get
from his family.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.030
Actually, with his family background,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.750
he didn't need to please women.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.030
May I ask...?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.040
I slept with him.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.680
When was the last time

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.520
you two met?

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.070
Probably Christmas.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.720
Have you heard

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.920
of Chen Danling?

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:27.430
Of course.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.830
She is very similar to Zheng Xintao.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.160
In my opinion,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.550
anything that is too perfect

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.240
is mostly fake.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.680
But many people

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.440
like perfection.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.750
How are things going?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.070
I've got the camera.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.510
How did Zheng Xintao die?

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.400
Tell me.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.440
What exactly did you do?

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.680
The death of Zheng Xintao...

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.590
Don't worry.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.720
It wasn't me.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.770
You should be concerned

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.150
about what else is in the camera
besides the erotic photos.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.270
What do you mean?

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.710
Chen Danling must've done it on purpose.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.160
She is very jealous.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.940
Let's go to Zheng Xintao's villa
in Jiangzhong District.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.200
Xu is there.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.420
(Fan Street)

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.590
Captain He.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.590
Yin.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.870
Where is Xu Jingzhi?

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.110
Mr. Xu is upstairs,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.600
saying he needs to think for a while.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.980
He does have that habit.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.510
Stay downstairs and take a look.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.040
Alright.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.080
Liu Ming,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.570
go check if there are any ice cubes

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.210
in the fridge.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.790
Alright, I'll go check.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.280
Coming.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.140
(Edible Ice)

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.230
Does he need an ambulance?

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.190
No.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.790
What happened to Mr. Xu?

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.630
Nightmare.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.830
Overthinking

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.510
leads to nightmares when asleep.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.000
Just a few minutes.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.640
I'm back to full health.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.480
You're all here.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.100
Everything's fine here.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.110
You're ready to return
to the front line, huh?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.030
That's too violent.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.400
The killer wrapped

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.880
the victim's face

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.830
and neck

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.790
with the film,

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.240
and then heated the film.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.790
If we hadn't arrived in time,

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.020
were you planning to die here?

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.550
I can go ask Zheng Xintao

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.930
who exactly is the murderer

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.040
and come back to tell you.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.950
You just wait.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.040
I'll kick you out of the police force

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.950
legally and properly.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.640
Some things are just obvious.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.240
Right.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.350
You're right.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.740
Didn't you say that before?

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.590
Most of a person's thoughts exist

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.430
in the subconscious.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.160
All the truth is
in that instant you see it.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:29.990
But you're a police officer.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.310
You have to talk about evidence.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.480
What are you pointing at?

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.030
The clue is obvious.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.270
All the film rolls are gone.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.510
The killer has been here.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.640
Wait until I finish.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.830
Captain He, come out.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200
I didn't expect

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.230
there would be so many erotic photos.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.920
Do you think this is his profession

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.590
or his hobby?

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.630
Look here.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440
Every single one

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.060
has it in the lower right corner.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.920
When you write the case report,

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.440
you get annoyed after a few words.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.110
Wang Chen is lying.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.750
Chen Danling's photo is right here.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.510
She didn't take it.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.310
Whose number is missing?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.720
Who wants Zheng Xintao dead

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.750
and is also close to Wang Chen?

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.200
The person outside the group photo?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.880
Give me five more minutes.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.830
(A photography enthusiast)

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.110
(didn't have a camera at home.)

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.480
(The suspect stole the negatives)

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.790
(and left behind erotic photos.)

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.830
(Are they meant)

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.310
(to distract attention?)

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.260
(What kind of secret is hidden)

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.500
(in the negatives?)

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.680
(Who exactly is it?)

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.680
Don't play dumb.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.980
It's not suitable for you.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.720
Both you

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.590
and I know

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.550
your situation now.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.950
Go back to school.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.480
Don't force yourself.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.400
I just returned to the front line.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.550
It will surely take time

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.510
to get used to it.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.270
Besides, I'm not someone

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.550
who backs down from difficulties.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.920
Did you forget how you

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.000
left the front line?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.240
Why not try it?

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.270
I bought it for you.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.730
You understand me best.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.510
Can you drink coffee now?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.000
I can.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.160
I'm thinking...

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.240
This happened 15 years ago.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.830
Could it be possible

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.000
that you haven't moved on?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.000
Xu Jingzhi.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.270
Xu Jingzhi, wake up.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040
Are you crazy?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.760
Xu Jingzhi,

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.880
I understand you the most,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.450
but you don't understand me.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.510
We were even married.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.630
What?

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.520
The key.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.070
(My marriage with Xu Jingzhi)

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.680
(is more like a story that ended)

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.790
(before it had begun.)

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.680
(Not long after we got married,)

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.550
(Wu Min)

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.650
(unexpectedly passed away)

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.720
(during a home invasion,)

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.110
(only leaving behind)

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.790
(Lu Ran, the younger brother)

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.720
(he acknowledged)

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.280
(in the trafficking case.)

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.590
(The death of Lu Ran's mother)

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.200
(plunged Xu Jingzhi into an obsession.)

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.790
(He kept projecting his own emotions)

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.310
(into the killer's mindset,)

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.310
(thinking he could turn back time)

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.440
(and make everything right.)

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.070
(It is precisely this obsession)

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.470
(that made him stay away
from the front line)

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.450
(and return to the academy to teach.)

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.550
(I thought he could slowly let go
this way,)

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.110
(but I forgot)

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.440
(I was also a witness to the case.)

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.960
(Living with me,)

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.510
(he'd only enter
nightmares every night,)

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.880
(never able to find relief.)

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.500
Be careful not to cut your hand.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.910
Let me do it.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.000
Perhaps leaving him cruelly

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.920
is the way I can tell Xu Jingzhi

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.960
that I love him.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.030
Almost there.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.430
Not seeing me off?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.480
Let it be.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.400
(Now, you are back.)

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.000
(How should I protect you?)

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.340
(Delete)

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.700
(Are you sure you want to move
the file to the recycle bin?)

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.070
(Have you found a way)

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.480
(to stay calm?)

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.480
You're so happy.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.830
Because I can be by your side.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.400
I really didn't expect

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.160
the chef to learn painting for me.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.230
Then I have to learn to cook.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.270
That'd be great.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.320
I can teach you.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.720
I will prepare
the necessary ingredients.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.480
Then you...

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.280
Next time.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.790
It's not time yet.

00:31:43.713 --> 00:31:44.340
Good night.

00:31:44.853 --> 00:31:45.313
Good night.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.460
(Ding Chuan:
Making your own erotic photos?)

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.720
Your relationship

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.190
is subtle.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.480
Zheng Xintao's home has been checked.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.350
No suspicious fingerprints were found

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.890
on film canisters and the darkroom.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.880
They were wiped clean.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.350
The tech dpt. has also confirmed

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.590
the numbers on the photos

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.640
are indeed in order.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.960
Order means there is a pattern.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.300
How many photos
did the killer take away?

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.640
Sometimes, talking to you

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.910
is quite effortless.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.560
170 photos.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.900
But I don't know

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.860
if it's from one person

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.820
or from multiple people.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.760
Playing tricks?

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.370
Did you bring the stuff?

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.590
Cell phone.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.060
(Disgusting)

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.840
Are you crazy?

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.810
Making your own erotic pictures.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.150
A person who is already dead

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.230
walking around everywhere?

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.710
Are you following me?

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.000
What's wrong?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.960
Afraid I'm following?

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.280
You won't let me meet your boss,

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.400
so I have to think of a way.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.220
(Zhao Xin)

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.280
Hello?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.760
Okay.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.550
Okay.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.760
I know.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.070
Good.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.670
So romantic.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
You're always standing

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.280
downstairs at her place.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.280
Let me guess.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.630
What's your relationship?

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.510
Friend?

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.920
Lover?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.910
Secret crush?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.030
Or a master?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:15.920
If not for the boss

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.060
needing the ledger from you,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.320
you'd have been long dead.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.280
Since you can't kill me,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.710
don't get so emotional.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.760
In the camera

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.440
that Zheng Xintao took away,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.710
there are photos of the ledger.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.080
If I hadn't retrieved them for you,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.280
they would've long been exposed

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.510
to the police.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.300
You want to make the ledger public?

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.190
What about Zhao Xin's life?

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.870
Come on.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.670
Do it.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.360
Pierce my neck.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:50.950
Pierce here.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.550
Come on.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.670
Where is the original ledger?

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.320
Help me with two more things.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.840
Also, pass a message to your boss.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.120
I will not hand over the ledger

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.160
to an underling.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.560
We've got the investigation results

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.400
on Wang Chen's home.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.840
The crime tools she mentioned

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.680
are all present.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.590
How did you determine

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.040
that Wang Chen is not the murderer?

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.670
Just because she is left-handed

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.140
and the murderer uses the right hand?

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.480
Murderers always lie

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.590
and destroy

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.840
the evidence.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.510
Wang Chen's boyfriend

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.960
also mentioned it in his testimony.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.150
A set wax figure is hard to handle.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.800
It requires professional skills.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.320
Neither Wang Chen

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.480
nor Chen Danling

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.630
can reach this level.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.120
Let's begin.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.500
This is a guest who has been

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.340
to my studio.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.590
How is your relationship?

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.140
She just came to look at the paintings.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.680
What relationship could there be?

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.320
Have you seen her before?

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.960
They were my high school classmates,

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.320
living very close to me.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.030
After graduation,
we hardly kept in touch.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.290
A classmate you lost contact with.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.630
Yet you sent flowers to her book club.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.360
Right at the book club,

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.230
you saw that Chen Danling

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.800
was splashed with blood.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.230
You didn't show concern

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.760
- and seemed a bit
- Everyone,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.770
- pleased.
- due to this unexpected situation,

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.130
- This reaction
- the book club

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:52.670
- seems unusual to me.
- will end here.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.030
Please leave in an orderly manner.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.590
Do you have some kind of grudge?

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.130
I was just smiling

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.500
because she still enjoyed playing

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.640
malicious marketing tricks.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:07.960
Wang Chen invited me.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.230
After all, we were classmates.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.710
I have to go.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.300
What about Zheng Xintao?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.440
He and Chen Danling

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.150
were also dating.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.280
You know that, right?

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.960
Their romantic relationships

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.480
are very messy.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.710
We're different.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.310
Do you still remember the new freezer

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.140
in Wang Chen's home?

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.020
(Strong Bleach)

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.350
How is it?

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.590
Nothing.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.360
The freezer might be a cover-up

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.440
for taking the blame.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.840
You can check on Zhang Yutong.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.980
(They were cut in half;)

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.370
(each half misses its other half.)

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.430
(They don't want to eat)

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.140
(or do anything.)

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:24.030
Sorry.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.240
Something came up.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.280
What are you reading?

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.230
This book says

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.670
people are born incomplete and lonely.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.190
For their entire life,

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.760
they're looking for the other half.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.440
Do you also believe in such love?

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.250
What are you looking at?

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.550
Before you are fully prepared,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.760
don't make decisions too soon.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.640
One,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.200
two,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.720
three.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.870
Look.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.070
The man across from you

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.030
did it.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.440
People are all the same.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.360
I will expose his true colors

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.590
before he deceives you.
