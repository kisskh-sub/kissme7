Why did you get a butterfly tattoo?

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:24.129
I don't particularly like butterflies.

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:27.298
But don't you think
the way butterflies perch,

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:29.008
open their wings,

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.636
flapping them,

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.597
then suddenly fly away,
looks like they're dancing?

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.227
I really hope that people think

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.356
I dance as effortlessly
and beautifully as a butterfly.

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:48.194
That's why I got this tattoo
on a spot I can hide.

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.323
I thought no one would notice it
since it was small.

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:53.908
But the teacher scolded me on day one.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.829
She asked, "How can
professional ballerinas have tattoos?"

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:01.499
She said I must cover them with foundation
whenever I perform.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.087
I originally thought
that when I danced on stage,

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.382
I'd be able to see the butterfly flying
whenever I lifted my arm.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:13.761
It's beautiful, right?

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.269
Yes.

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:23.688
Beautiful.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:10.920
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.007
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:20.430
This is the dance room.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.644
Just a bit further.
Jen-yao's classroom is up ahead.

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.981
This way, please.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.405
How much do you know about
your classmate, Li Jen-yao?

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:38.948
Li Jen-yao?

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:40.575
Him selling drugs wouldn't surprise me.

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:44.245
Have you heard about him doing drugs
or selling them to a classmate in school?

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.496
I've heard about that.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.207
He knows I'm rich,
so he asked if I was interested.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.417
I don't know.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.336
Even if someone was a wuss,

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:53.796
he'd blackmail them too.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.467
In our first year,
we even fought with him because of this.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.678
Back then, if…

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.934
If we had helped him more back then,

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.063
would he have turned out differently?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.274
Fuck.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.693
Ouyang, you were awesome earlier.

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:17.862
Hey, you all made it sound true.

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.950
To be honest,
when you said you wanted to mess with him,

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:24.994
I didn't expect this.

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.622
With that, Li Jen-yao can't go on anymore.

00:04:27.705 --> 00:04:29.040
It's game over for him.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.333
He can only reincarnate.

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:32.168
Just a matter of when he's caught now.

00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:34.212
Fuck!

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.756
This is so boring.

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:40.176
If I knew he'd be arrested so soon,

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:45.014
I would've thought of a more fun way
to mess with him for sure.

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.559
I really,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.438
really, really want him
to have even more fun

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:54.440
and feel even more hurt.

00:05:07.787 --> 00:05:10.206
Li Jen-yao.

00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:13.876
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat?
I'll buy it for you.

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:16.295
Li Jen-yao.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.341
You're hiding in here?

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:22.718
Didn't you hear me calling you?

00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:36.459
Why are you burning up?

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:41.923
Li Jen-yao.

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.090
Are you okay?

00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:16.374
You're awake?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.130
I think you still have a fever.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:24.799
It's better if you take another pill.

00:07:25.508 --> 00:07:27.718
Eat the porridge first.
Then take the medicine.

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:31.347
Thank you.

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.155
What's that?

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.494
My aunt's house
doesn't have water or electricity.

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:55.371
You need lights even if you're alone.

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.375
I saw this battery-powered Christmas tree
in the storage room earlier.

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.545
What do you think?
Feels like Christmas, right?

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:07.883
I've never celebrated it.

00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:10.261
You've never celebrated Christmas?

00:08:10.344 --> 00:08:11.971
How can that be? Your family…

00:08:20.688 --> 00:08:21.522
Hey.

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.775
Since you've never celebrated Christmas,

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:27.987
how about we celebrate it
together this year?

00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:32.908
How do we celebrate it?

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:35.661
Well,

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.622
we'll decorate
the Christmas tree together,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.458
have a feast,

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:42.752
and exchange gifts.

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.713
Sure.

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:47.006
Good.

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:01.062
Rest here for a bit.

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:03.981
I'll buy some daily necessities for you.
I'll be back in a bit.

00:09:06.692 --> 00:09:07.610
Wait.

00:09:08.527 --> 00:09:10.488
It's dark around here. I'll go with you.

00:09:10.571 --> 00:09:12.365
But your fever just went down.

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:20.581
I'm fine now.

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:22.416
Let's go.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.259
Hey, Li Jen-yao, hold on.
I forgot to buy something.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:46.482
Guy with the hoodie over there, wait!

00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:48.442
Officer.

00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:49.777
Excuse me.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.195
Excuse me, if I may.

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.280
I lost my mobile phone.
How do I file a report?

00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:56.617
Do you remember
where you last saw your phone?

00:09:57.535 --> 00:09:58.744
Let me think.

00:09:58.828 --> 00:10:01.288
It was still with me
when I went to school today.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:33.320
What's wrong?

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:38.492
I feel terrible about myself.

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:43.080
I'm fine.
That officer didn't give me a hard time.

00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:49.712
Why are you silent again?

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.676
Maybe it's because of the medicine.

00:10:57.011 --> 00:10:58.262
I'm a bit sleepy.

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:04.810
Get some good rest.

00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:07.104
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:53.025
Li Jen-yao.

00:11:54.151 --> 00:11:54.985
I knew it.

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:58.614
You stayed quiet on purpose,
so I'd leave and you could run off, right?

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:01.992
What else can I do?

00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:04.578
Stay and be a burden on you?

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:06.497
When did I say you were a burden?

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:09.667
I don't know what I should do now.

00:12:10.626 --> 00:12:13.921
I only know that if I stay,
I'll cause you harm sooner or later.

00:12:15.464 --> 00:12:17.341
That's the one thing I can't accept.

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:19.635
You won't cause me harm.

00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:22.346
I know you can't stay here long either.

00:12:22.429 --> 00:12:23.973
But I can help you find a way.

00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:24.974
That's impossible.

00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:28.143
Ouyang Ti set me up from the beginning.

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:30.229
He bought off my dad.

00:12:30.312 --> 00:12:32.064
He told the cops
that I use and sell drugs.

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:34.567
He even came to my place
and forced me to take an injection.

00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:38.737
Ouyang Ti took photos.
They're on his phone.

00:12:39.738 --> 00:12:41.490
Even if I went to the police now,

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.493
no one would believe that I'm innocent.

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:49.832
It's all planned.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.210
Maybe even the police have been bribed.

00:12:58.257 --> 00:12:59.842
Where would you go if you left here?

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:11.729
I know I can't help you much,
but I can't let you go.

00:13:11.812 --> 00:13:13.105
I can't leave you alone.

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:14.899
Give me some more time, okay?

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:16.066
I'll help find a way.

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:19.570
Two heads are better than one,
no matter what.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.117
Please don't go, okay?

00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:39.006
Hsiao-tung, let's go home together?

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.424
Hello.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.718
Hey, Ouyang.

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:44.094
Give her a ride home.

00:13:44.178 --> 00:13:46.263
-Are you stupid?
-What the fuck?

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:48.015
You must have a lot of free time.

00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:49.099
What?

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:52.811
Ouyang Ti set me up from the beginning.

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:55.481
He even came to my place
and forced me to take an injection.

00:13:55.564 --> 00:13:58.067
Ouyang Ti took photos.
They're on his phone.

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:06.075
You keep offering to give me a ride home.

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:09.411
Is there nowhere else to go?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.137
Let's go to karaoke
after school on Friday.

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:30.224
I want to go too.

00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:38.315
Sure.

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.274
See you then.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.985
Okay.

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:42.403
See you then.

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:44.613
Bye.

00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:51.912
Hey, isn't your girl…

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:54.623
Isn't Chiang Hsiao-tung with that fucker…

00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.625
If she wants to play,

00:14:57.918 --> 00:14:59.336
let's play with her.

00:15:00.004 --> 00:15:00.838
Okay?

00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:03.007
Sure, let's play. What do we do?

00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:08.637
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.688
It really wasn't me.

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:19.273
Don't run!

00:15:35.122 --> 00:15:36.123
Jen-yao.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.045
Call the police if you want.

00:15:43.672 --> 00:15:44.715
Hey.

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:47.342
Wait.

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:49.053
Wait.

00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:07.362
Take this.

00:16:07.446 --> 00:16:09.198
Get as far away as you can.

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:11.533
Don't come back even if you're safe.

00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:13.786
Let's wait until it's really over.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.625
Don't worry about me.
I'll find you for sure.

00:16:27.216 --> 00:16:28.550
Believe it or not,

00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:30.427
I didn't use that stuff.

00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:32.012
He planted it.

00:16:40.813 --> 00:16:41.647
Li Jen-yao.

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:41.123
You're really mean!

00:17:42.332 --> 00:17:44.168
Didn't you say you wouldn't leave?

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.544
Why did you lie to me?

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:48.714
I didn't leave.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.175
I just went home to get something.

00:17:51.258 --> 00:17:53.135
Then why is your stuff so organized?

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:56.430
You were obviously ready to leave.
Stop lying.

00:17:58.223 --> 00:17:59.308
I'm sorry.

00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:03.145
To be honest,
I wanted to leave secretly this morning.

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:06.106
I didn't wanna trouble you.

00:18:07.566 --> 00:18:10.152
But I thought about it all day
and realized…

00:18:13.405 --> 00:18:14.907
that without you,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.951
I really don't know where I can go.

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:27.419
Then why didn't you say so from the start?

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:30.547
You know how scared I was
when I didn't see you earlier?

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:33.759
If you disappeared just like that,

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:36.345
how would I find you?

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:22.933
Chiang Hsiao-tung,

00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:24.476
where are you?

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:28.522
Your aunt came by our house earlier
to give us some stuff,

00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:32.025
but no one answered the phone or the door.

00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:35.362
Nothing.

00:19:35.445 --> 00:19:37.698
I was exhausted from dance practice today,

00:19:37.781 --> 00:19:39.199
so I dozed off in my room.

00:19:39.283 --> 00:19:41.535
Why did you call me? Are you coming home?

00:19:41.618 --> 00:19:43.870
Gosh, I'm so busy here. How can I go home?

00:19:43.954 --> 00:19:45.664
-Go back to sleep. Yes?
-Ma'am.

00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:47.708
-Should I order from you?
-Sorry, hold on.

00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:50.085
Hey, be careful by yourself at home.

00:19:50.168 --> 00:19:52.129
I'll be back later.

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:53.463
Okay, bye.

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.090
Okay, I got it.

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:56.008
Bye.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.431
That scared me.

00:20:02.514 --> 00:20:03.932
My mom suddenly called.

00:20:04.016 --> 00:20:05.726
I thought I'd get caught.

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:08.812
Let me take you home

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:10.647
or your family will worry.

00:20:13.775 --> 00:20:14.818
Don't worry.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.988
I'll stay here for the next few days.
I won't go anywhere.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.282
Even if I'm going somewhere,

00:20:20.782 --> 00:20:22.534
I'll make sure to let you know.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.995
I won't make you worry again.

00:20:31.918 --> 00:20:35.339
I realized that someone on the Internet
faced a similar situation to mine.

00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:39.301
I noticed there was a lawyer from Taipei
who posted in the comments.

00:20:39.384 --> 00:20:41.636
He told the person seeking help what to do

00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:43.805
and provided his contact information.

00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:47.309
He said he was willing to help,
so I gave him a call.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:48.643
What did he say?

00:20:49.311 --> 00:20:51.688
He suggested
I clear things up with the police.

00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:55.609
He even said he could go with me
to the police station to clarify things.

00:20:56.485 --> 00:20:57.778
But you told me

00:20:57.861 --> 00:21:01.281
Ouyang Ti and his guys
took photos with his phone to frame you.

00:21:01.365 --> 00:21:04.034
If they use the photos as evidence,
what will you do?

00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:06.870
Don't worry.

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.830
The lawyer told me

00:21:08.914 --> 00:21:12.250
those photos may actually prove
that I was framed.

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:15.462
-Did the lawyer really say that?
-Yeah.

00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:18.423
Come on, I'll take you home.

00:21:27.224 --> 00:21:28.058
What's wrong?

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:33.897
When are you going to Taipei?

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:35.899
Do you want me to go with you?

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.277
Actually,

00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:41.321
I'm not sure when I'll go.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:44.408
Why? Shouldn't you sort this out
as soon as you can?

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:48.203
Yes, but if I go to Taipei
to take care of this,

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:50.455
I won't be able to return for a long time.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:51.832
I'm worried

00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.626
that I won't be able
to keep my promise to you.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.503
What promise?

00:21:57.462 --> 00:21:58.797
I promised

00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:01.133
I'd watch your end-of-semester show.

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:05.929
What?

00:22:06.012 --> 00:22:07.931
So that's what you're worried about.

00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:11.768
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:22:13.603 --> 00:22:14.438
Come with me.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.381
Sit here.

00:22:41.465 --> 00:22:42.924
Wait for me. I'll be quick.

00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:47.679
Quickly, sit down.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.097
Give me a second.

00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:04.696
Can you hear it?

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:13.330
Great.

00:23:13.872 --> 00:23:17.167
I'm going to do my dance solo
in the end-of-semester performance.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.628
Pay attention. I'm only gonna do it once.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.193
Are you okay?

00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:26.486
I'm fine.

00:24:26.987 --> 00:24:28.530
I just twisted my ankle.

00:24:29.531 --> 00:24:32.450
I should've known.
It's different without ballet shoes on.

00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:34.536
How embarrassing.

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:40.834
Did you bring me here
because of what I said earlier?

00:24:43.128 --> 00:24:44.087
Yes.

00:24:45.714 --> 00:24:47.424
I know you want to keep your word,

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:53.513
but I don't want you
to not do what you should because of me.

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:56.141
So…

00:24:57.475 --> 00:24:59.436
So you brought me here

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.105
to show me the dance…

00:25:04.316 --> 00:25:05.567
you're doing in the show?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.154
Yeah.

00:25:09.738 --> 00:25:10.947
Because

00:25:12.324 --> 00:25:13.742
I want you to come,

00:25:14.326 --> 00:25:15.785
just as I know you want to.

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:18.204
This is the first time

00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:20.790
I've really wanted to dance for someone.

00:25:40.852 --> 00:25:43.480
Who are you? What are you doing here?

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:48.193
Don't run!

00:26:49.462 --> 00:26:50.296
Is he gone?

00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:54.759
Did you see the way he ran?

00:28:21.846 --> 00:28:22.889
Hey, Li Jen-yao.

00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:27.060
Will it be a long time
before you come back from Taipei?

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:30.980
Once I've taken care of
everything in Taipei,

00:28:31.064 --> 00:28:31.940
I'll come back.

00:28:32.857 --> 00:28:34.108
And I swear,

00:28:34.692 --> 00:28:37.946
I won't leave you alone
so easily this time.

00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:40.949
Really?

00:28:41.032 --> 00:28:42.325
You said it.

00:28:43.868 --> 00:28:45.703
Whatever happens in the future,

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:47.455
I'll always be with you.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:49.707
I won't let go of your hand
so easily again.

00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:51.042
You said it.

00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:52.585
Okay.

00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:56.506
After all these annoying things are over,

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:58.466
let's forget

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:00.510
all the unhappy stuff

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.428
and start over.

00:29:05.056 --> 00:29:07.225
OUYANG HSIANG
FOR LEGISLATIVE YUAN, TAICHUNG

00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:18.319
Thank you.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.866
Thank you.

00:29:40.383 --> 00:29:41.217
Fuck.

00:29:41.301 --> 00:29:43.261
That Chiang Hsiao-tung is so cheap.

00:29:43.928 --> 00:29:45.221
Why are you so worked up?

00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:46.431
It's that Lai Yun-chen.

00:29:46.514 --> 00:29:48.975
What kind of dumbass
steps forward for no reason?

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:50.977
Fuck, that whore Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.897
Acts cute, steals dudes,
and wants someone else to take the blame.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.941
How come a bitch like that
gets the lead in the show?

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:57.901
Fuck! Go to hell!

00:29:59.402 --> 00:30:00.403
Fan Wei-ting.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.405
Are you an idiot?

00:30:02.488 --> 00:30:04.157
I'm so mad, and you're laughing.

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:07.368
You being this mad is what makes it funny.

00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:08.494
I don't care.

00:30:08.578 --> 00:30:11.080
Get someone to teach her a lesson
or else I won't get over this.

00:30:24.969 --> 00:30:26.346
You want to teach her a lesson?

00:30:44.864 --> 00:30:46.991
I love Taiwanese girls

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:49.118
Taiwanese girls love me

00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:53.289
To me, Patty Hou is nothing

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.209
Put your hands up in the air

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:59.212
Don't worry about anything
Let me see your hands up in the air…

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:01.923
-Aren't you going to sing?
-You go ahead.

00:31:02.423 --> 00:31:03.549
Okay.

00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:06.844
Why don't we take a photo together?

00:31:06.928 --> 00:31:09.263
I don't think we've ever had one together.

00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:11.641
Put your hands up…

00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:13.434
Sure, no problem.

00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:14.894
Wait. Here.

00:31:14.978 --> 00:31:18.356
Toss your bras up, lift your shirts…

00:31:18.439 --> 00:31:20.483
One, two, three.

00:31:20.984 --> 00:31:23.152
Yeah. Got it.

00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:25.405
Toss your bras up

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:27.573
Lift your shirts…

00:31:28.157 --> 00:31:30.618
You've finished your drink.
I'll refill it for you.

00:31:30.702 --> 00:31:31.661
Cola?

00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:33.204
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Okay.

00:31:33.287 --> 00:31:34.998
Toss your bras up

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.126
Hey, here.

00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:39.460
Come select songs.

00:31:44.257 --> 00:31:45.633
Does Wen-ling want to sing?

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:48.094
-Wen-ling, what do you usually sing?
-Anything's fine.

00:31:48.678 --> 00:31:49.971
-Wu Bai's songs.
-Okay.

00:31:59.731 --> 00:32:00.982
Why aren't you singing?

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:02.150
Wait, still choosing.

00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:04.318
-Here.
-She's fine with anything, right?

00:32:04.402 --> 00:32:05.945
-Pick something for her.
-Okay.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:08.156
Don't be sad.

00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:09.240
I'm not sad.

00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:13.411
You look like you're preoccupied,

00:32:13.494 --> 00:32:14.996
not really here to have fun.

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.461
Nothing's on my mind.
I'm just a bit surprised.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.338
So this is
what you guys usually do for fun.

00:32:24.422 --> 00:32:26.090
Quite different from what I heard.

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:31.679
What did you hear?

00:32:32.555 --> 00:32:36.392
I heard from friends
who have hung out with you

00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:38.186
that you guys play hard.

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:40.104
But coming to karaoke with you today

00:32:40.605 --> 00:32:42.565
feels quite ordinary.

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:46.402
Hey, why do you sound a bit disappointed?

00:32:48.446 --> 00:32:49.405
You're right.

00:32:49.489 --> 00:32:51.949
I thought hanging out
with you guys would be more fun.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:55.119
Turns out, you guys aren't much different
from other good students.

00:32:55.203 --> 00:32:56.829
Good students?

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.124
Hey, Ouyang, she said
that you're a good student.

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.292
-Fuck.
-Damn.

00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:03.377
If Ouyang's a good student,
then I'm gifted.

00:33:03.878 --> 00:33:06.214
-Good student.
-Good student, fuck.

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:13.387
Do you really think so?

00:33:16.974 --> 00:33:18.309
I just think

00:33:18.392 --> 00:33:21.270
you don't need to pretend
to be a good kid in front of me.

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:23.981
Why else do you think
I agreed to hang out with you?

00:33:44.168 --> 00:33:46.129
Hey! Hi, you guys are here.

00:33:47.505 --> 00:33:48.673
Fuck, is it good?

00:33:57.431 --> 00:33:58.307
It'll be okay.

00:33:58.391 --> 00:33:59.350
Come on.

00:34:00.476 --> 00:34:01.644
Come on.

00:34:03.354 --> 00:34:04.522
Let's go.

00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:11.612
Hey.

00:34:11.696 --> 00:34:12.572
Let's play pool.

00:34:12.655 --> 00:34:13.698
Okay.

00:34:15.158 --> 00:34:16.576
Che-li, let's play pool.

00:34:18.828 --> 00:34:19.871
Wen-ling, join us.

00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:26.961
Hsiao-tung.

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:29.922
-Wen-ling's with me.
-Che-li, hurry.

00:34:30.006 --> 00:34:31.966
-Okay.
-I'll go with En-ya, then.

00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:39.182
Didn't you want
to try something interesting?

00:34:41.225 --> 00:34:43.436
What's the matter? Are you scared?

00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:48.232
You think this is my first time out?

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:50.276
Who knows what you're giving me?

00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:45.957
Don't worry.

00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:48.000
What I use

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:50.253
is definitely quality stuff.

00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:52.338
It'd better be.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.591
I'm gonna use the restroom first.

00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:57.593
I'll see if you're bluffing when I return.

00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:13.025
Why are you taking your schoolbag
to the restroom?

00:36:14.986 --> 00:36:17.238
You think girls
are like guys in the restroom?

00:36:17.321 --> 00:36:19.240
Just shake it and zip up?

00:36:20.157 --> 00:36:21.075
Okay.

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:24.870
Restrooms are over there.

00:36:28.374 --> 00:36:29.333
Thanks.

00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:59.030
LOCKED

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:02.533
Why don't we take a photo together?

00:37:08.956 --> 00:37:09.874
PIN ACCEPTED

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.584
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:05.137
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:10.351
You know, I'm so disappointed in you.

00:38:11.268 --> 00:38:12.478
Do you know that?

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.991
I'm asking you, do you know that?

00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:31.664
Do you know that?

00:38:33.165 --> 00:38:34.375
Do you know that?

00:38:37.294 --> 00:38:39.922
Do you know that?

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:48.264
Come on, let's go.

00:38:54.812 --> 00:38:57.231
I liked you because I thought

00:38:57.314 --> 00:39:00.276
you were different from other cheap girls.

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:03.446
But you're doing these things
for that piece of trash.

00:39:03.946 --> 00:39:05.573
You're even putting on a front.

00:39:06.282 --> 00:39:07.158
Fuck.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.618
This just makes you look cheaper.

00:39:10.411 --> 00:39:11.662
Hey, Wei-ting, Jung-tai.

00:39:11.745 --> 00:39:13.747
-Yes?
-Move it.

00:39:16.083 --> 00:39:17.168
Wen-ling, save me!

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:20.296
Shut up! You wanna end up like her?

00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:23.382
Hurry, call the police! Save me!

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:26.969
Hey.

00:39:27.803 --> 00:39:30.514
I know what you're thinking.
Don't worry, I'll help you!

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:31.682
I'll help you!

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.485
Hello?

00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:44.862
Is this Chiang Hsiao-tung's boyfriend?

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.035
Why do you have her phone?

00:39:51.118 --> 00:39:54.413
It's nothing.
We're all just hanging out as friends.

00:39:54.497 --> 00:39:55.748
Hey, listen.

00:39:55.831 --> 00:39:57.958
Your girlfriend is having a blast here.

00:39:58.042 --> 00:40:00.669
Give Hsiao-tung her phone back.
I wanna talk to her.

00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:02.087
Don't worry.

00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:04.423
She's really enjoying herself, honestly.

00:40:04.924 --> 00:40:07.092
Why don't I send you the address,

00:40:07.176 --> 00:40:08.802
so you can come over quickly?

00:40:08.886 --> 00:40:10.262
Come over.

00:40:10.346 --> 00:40:11.931
Hey, by the way,

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:15.017
we're all friends having fun,
so you'd better come alone.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.228
If you bring others to kill the vibe,

00:40:17.311 --> 00:40:20.731
your girl will be so sad and angry. Look.

00:40:35.246 --> 00:40:37.122
-You're still fighting?
-Let me go!

00:40:37.831 --> 00:40:40.459
-Hey, hold her tight.
-Let me go!

00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:43.629
-Don't move!
-Let me go!

00:40:43.712 --> 00:40:45.839
-Don't move. It's okay.
-Let me go!

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.884
Don't move. Hold still.

00:40:48.968 --> 00:40:50.427
Come on.

00:40:50.511 --> 00:40:52.846
-Hsiao-tung, smile.
-Smile.

00:40:53.597 --> 00:40:55.266
Smile.

00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:56.225
-Come on.
-Let go!

00:40:56.809 --> 00:40:57.893
Hey!

00:40:58.394 --> 00:41:00.688
Let me go!

00:41:00.771 --> 00:41:02.147
-Smile!
-Let me go!

00:41:22.668 --> 00:41:23.627
Kiddo.

00:41:25.713 --> 00:41:27.006
You don't wanna mess with him.

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:30.759
Listen to me.
Don't act tough or make it hard for me.

00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:33.721
Go home.

00:41:39.393 --> 00:41:40.352
Sorry.

00:41:41.437 --> 00:41:42.771
I'm just doing my job.

00:41:57.578 --> 00:41:58.412
Get up.

00:42:15.095 --> 00:42:16.221
Let me go up.

00:43:45.811 --> 00:43:46.645
It's raining?

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:49.606
-Fuck, my helmet is outside.
-That's so annoying.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.942
Che-li, run home by yourself later.

00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:55.446
Didn't you flip your helmet over?

00:43:55.529 --> 00:43:57.406
Fuck, my helmet.

00:44:00.033 --> 00:44:01.034
Now what?

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.938
Hey, Jen-yao.

00:44:30.606 --> 00:44:32.274
What took you so long?

00:44:32.775 --> 00:44:34.193
Your girl has been waiting.

00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:39.198
She's resting upstairs right now.

00:44:39.698 --> 00:44:41.408
Remember to take her home later.

00:56:22.484 --> 00:56:27.489
