We're meeting Im Dong Hyeon today, remember?

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:46.125
Dong Su?

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.525
Mind if I ask what this is about?

00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:52.995
The reason I started Deluxe Taxi was all because of Dong Su.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:54.835
What kind of justice is this?

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.465
We still haven't even found his body!

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.235
Don't die. Let's get our revenge together.

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.705
Since no one believed Mr. Park Dong Su 15 years ago,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:07.715
let's do the reverse. What if we trust him completely?

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:10.174
Im Dong Hyeon who was released 15 years ago.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.885
Can you find out where he is now?

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.715
Sir, you had a phone call earlier. The name was Park Min Ho.

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:17.785
Park Min Ho. You buried him for good, right?

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.055
You want me to bury you too?

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.154
I think I've found the person...

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:24.125
Im Dong Hyeon was with on that day 15 years ago.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:25.895
He's Jo Seong Uk.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.195
He had a poor record, but he became a college coach, which is tough.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.705
And he held that position for a long time.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:35.135
But doesn't something seem off with Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk?

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:36.304
It's a big match.

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.745
Nothing's more important than that for us, right?

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:43.175
This "something more important" has to be kept secret.

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:47.155
So Im Dong Hyeon was here five hours doing online sports betting?

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:49.915
No. Im Dong Hyeon wasn't gambling.

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:51.655
He was fixing matches.

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:53.895
With Jo Seong Uk, who's at the match.

Nice!

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:10.775
- That was a tough one. So close. - My bad.

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:12.605
- Focus! Stay in sync with the team. - Yeon Tae.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.975
- Focus. - Right.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:17.815

Hey!

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:27.625
- You could've called for it. - My bad.

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.925
It's okay, guys. Take it slow. Let's catch up point by point.

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:35.265
- Yeon Tae. The receive. - Got it.

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:39.105

Hey! Focus, will you?

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:53.045
And what was that sign the coach just gave you?

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:54.555
I've never seen that sign before.

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:56.755
What are you talking about? What sign?

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.495
Hey! Stop getting distracted and focus on your own game.

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:03.155
- Get into your position. - Yes, Coach.

We'll talk later in private.

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:22.375
Hey, Yeon Tae. Come in, have a seat.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:25.045
What are the other guys up to?

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:27.755
They finished stretching and are doing their own drills.

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:30.525
By the way, did you hear Ji Hoon got another scouting offer?

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:32.825
His asking price went up again.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.095
Yes, I heard something about it from the other guys.

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:39.325
This business is so ruthless.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:45.035
Others get a "salary" or "pay." But they call ours "market value."

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:46.365
You know?

00:03:47.175 --> 00:03:48.175
Yeon Tae.

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:52.075
I think this world is incredibly unfair.

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:54.615
Nothing else matters. Perform well, and you're set.

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:57.245
Though we all work just as hard, you know?

00:03:57.785 --> 00:03:58.815
Isn't that right?

00:04:00.685 --> 00:04:03.015
The next game is critical.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:08.695
You work hard and trust my calls, no matter what they are.

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.125
You're the ace of our team.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.995
This is your market value, kid.

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:20.835
Kid, you're worth more than Ji Hoon.

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.545
But, Coach.

00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:28.975
Ji Hoon is suspicious of me right now.

00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:34.085
He asked if we were exchanging our own secret signals.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.125
All right. I'll have a talk with Ji Hoon.

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:41.195
You just focus on the next game.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:43.325
It's the last game of the season.

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:45.825
- Yes, sir. - Okay, go on.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.235
- Thank you. - Sure.

00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:51.335
- Yeon Tae. - Yes?

00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:53.235
I'm counting on you.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.605
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:51.965
My goodness.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:54.935
Just stay down.

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:56.635
I'm fine.

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:01.735
Have you seen...

00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:03.435
his face?

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:06.205
No.

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:09.315
Right.

00:06:11.915 --> 00:06:12.915
Ji Hoon.

00:06:13.485 --> 00:06:15.915
There's more to being an athlete than just playing well.

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:19.585
How could you be so careless during the season?

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:21.995
I'm sorry.

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:30.705
- No, Coach. I'm really fine. - What do you mean you're fine, kid?

00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.165
You think I don't know what you're up against?

00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:37.945
Consider it a bonus from your coach. Take it.

00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:41.275
It's fine. Everything will be fine.

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:43.945
So get the treatment you need...

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:46.045
and take your time coming back.

00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:48.484
- Got it? - Yes.

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:49.655
All right, I'm heading out.

00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:04.465
Hey, that jerk Ji Hoon is still alive.

00:07:04.735 --> 00:07:06.365
All right, that's 20,000 dollars after the hospital bills.

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:07.675
Go on, count it.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:14.815
- Yes, what is it? - Hey, Seong Uk.

00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:18.845
There's a problem at the gym.

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:20.855
Let's meet up and talk.

00:07:21.785 --> 00:07:24.925
(Closed for renovations)

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:28.595
The network line came from the empty unit on the first basement level.

00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:31.125
That's why nothing showed up on the gym's network.

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:32.425
Why?

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:34.795
To spoof the IP and hide their location.

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:36.835
So, the main server is overseas,

00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:38.535
but the encryption is blockchain-based.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:41.105
Which means it can only be accessed from this computer.

00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:43.175
The site itself is a rental.

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:45.875
I heard blockchain encryption is hard to crack.

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:47.875
So how did you break it, Go Eun?

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:49.945
It is hard.

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:54.555
That's why they just wrote it here at the bottom.

00:07:56.955 --> 00:08:00.325
So that's why he offered 20,000 dollars just to rent it for a day.

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.665
Look at all these betting categories.

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.065
This looks complicated.

00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:09.635
Wouldn't it be easier to rig with fewer options?

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:12.005
The system is simple.

00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:15.875
The payout is divided proportionally among those who guess correctly.

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:19.505
If a lot of people win, the individual payout is small.

00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:21.945
But if only a few people win, the payout is huge.

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:23.245
That's all there is to it.

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.085
Second set, three consecutive receiving errors.

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.485
Third set, three consecutive service aces.

00:08:31.325 --> 00:08:33.825
Almost no one would bet on outcomes like these.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.755
I wouldn't bet on that either. How could that even happen...

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:37.925
unless it was rigged?

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:41.535
Oh, so it's rigged.

00:08:42.165 --> 00:08:43.395
Im Dong Hyeon...

00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:46.865
bet on this and won 500,000 dollars.

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:49.075
In just three hours.

00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:53.245
So Im Dong Hyeon tells Jo Seong Uk which bets have the longest odds,

00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:56.375
and Jo Seong Uk makes them happen during the game.

00:08:56.445 --> 00:08:58.445
That's how they've been fixing the matches.

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:00.085
It's 500,000 dollars for 1 fix.

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:02.055
They'll be back to rent the gym soon.

00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:04.285
I'll take down the site for now.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.285
No, leave it up.

00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:10.125
Leave it up? And let them keep fixing matches?

00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:12.265
Yes.

00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:14.295
We need to find Park Min Ho...

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:16.135
using that site.

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:18.864
You're saying we can find Park Min Ho who died 15 years ago...

00:09:18.865 --> 00:09:20.365
with this site?

00:09:20.835 --> 00:09:21.835
Yes.

00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:23.405
As long as...

00:09:24.075 --> 00:09:25.575
we have someone on the inside.

00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:40.285
Seong Uk, look, I never intended to put the gym up as collateral.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:47.464
Wait. Just hear me out, buddy.

00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:49.135
"Buddy?" Don't call me that, you scum.

00:09:50.765 --> 00:09:52.905
Don't you know what that gym means to us?

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:57.975
- Why did you do this, you jerk? - I messed up.

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:00.545
You get that gym back by tomorrow.

00:10:01.315 --> 00:10:02.315
Got it?

00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:04.945
And to think I called you a friend.

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:07.885
You darn gambling addict.

00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:31.375
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:36.275
I don't care how angry he is. Who beats up their friend like that?

00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:39.645
Looks like he could use a consolation prize.

00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:42.414
Why did he throw the money? Darn it.

00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:43.455
(Rainbow Taxi)

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:45.555
He used to be so nice back in school.

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.855
It's scary how money changes people. Seriously.

00:10:49.225 --> 00:10:52.265
This is nowhere near enough. What am I supposed to do?

00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:54.635
(Funeral Hall)

00:10:54.665 --> 00:10:56.265
Thank you. We'll put it to good use.

00:11:02.335 --> 00:11:04.475
Mr. Im. You look pretty wasted.

00:11:05.705 --> 00:11:06.705
Hey.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.115
Spot me some more.

00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:15.655
The sun's about to come up. You should go home.

00:11:16.115 --> 00:11:17.155
Just give it to me!

00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:20.385
How about you pay back what you already owe first?

00:11:20.485 --> 00:11:23.525
- I'm a VIP here. - Sir.

00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:26.925
My guys got hurt last time, and we paid for hefty medical bills.

00:11:26.995 --> 00:11:29.965
Can't you see we only tolerate you because you're a VIP?

00:11:30.435 --> 00:11:31.705
Was I the one who hit them?

00:11:32.435 --> 00:11:34.175
- Was I? - What did you just say?

00:11:34.335 --> 00:11:37.875
If it's the bills, deal with me. Why take it out on him?

00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:39.145
It's him.

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:41.414
It's him.

00:11:41.415 --> 00:11:44.415
Instead of trying to pay me back, you're in here gambling again.

00:11:44.485 --> 00:11:46.515
And whose fault do you think that is?

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:50.755
Let's play one round.

00:11:54.925 --> 00:11:57.125
(Collateral Agreement)

00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:01.065
What's wrong? Don't you want to win your gym back?

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:14.045
There you go.

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:16.245
You can't win if you don't look at your hand.

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:20.785
Darn it.

00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:24.885
A bust.

00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.385
Take it.

00:12:39.135 --> 00:12:41.635
What the? This isn't a bust. It's a winning hand.

00:12:45.405 --> 00:12:47.975
Hey, hold on a second.

00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:53.185
You fought hard to win this from me. Why just give it back?

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:54.815
What, you have a problem with me giving it to you?

00:12:56.115 --> 00:12:58.585
You must have a reason for doing this.

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.225
My motto in life is to keep things interesting.

00:13:03.855 --> 00:13:06.495
And being a gym owner was just not interesting.

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:12.105
I don't think I ever got your name.

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:14.435
Nice to meet you.

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:16.035
I'm Park Min Ho.

00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:25.485
Who?

00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:29.355
Park Min Ho.

00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:31.485
You can just call me Min Ho.

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:37.395
So we're clear. You just gave this to me for free.

00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:39.865
Don't try to take it back later.

00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:42.364
Hey, you got it for free.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.135
You owe me a drink, don't you?

00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:46.535
Talking about drinking this early in the morning?

00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:50.474
Come on, let's go for Round Two.

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:53.175
- He's not dead! - That's enough.

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:54.315
Honey.

00:13:54.575 --> 00:13:57.945
You can't go into the crematorium. It's too hot!

00:13:58.015 --> 00:13:59.645
Crying like that won't bring him back.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:01.885
- Stop crying. - No!

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:05.324
- Let's give him a proper send-off. - He's not dead!

00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:07.524
- Let's go now. - What do you mean...

00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:08.854
- he's not dead? - He's not dead!

00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:10.054
Let him go.

00:14:10.055 --> 00:14:12.925
- I said he's not dead! - Like he's coming back.

00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:17.265
Park Min Ho. Why a dead guy's name? What a jinx.

00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:20.635
- What's that? - What is that?

00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:21.705
It's a ghost!

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:23.405
- Look! - A ghost.

00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:25.045
- What? - It's a ghost.

00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:26.405
Look at that.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:28.044
My friend.

00:14:28.045 --> 00:14:30.915
Hey, buddy. Time for Round Two, right?

00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:33.515
- You can't fall asleep on me now. - I know, right?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.085
Gosh, my head.

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:42.025
Where am I?

00:14:50.135 --> 00:14:52.865
Darn it, what on earth happened?

00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:55.575
You drank too much, that's what.

00:14:57.975 --> 00:14:58.975
Hey.

00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:04.445
How did you get in here?

00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:08.415
Why the surprise? You brought me here, bragging.

00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:10.555
I did?

00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:13.755
I said the second round was on me. And you brought us here.

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.825
How else would I have gotten in here?

00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:18.725
Round Two was on you?

00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:21.465
That does sound kind of familiar.

00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:23.895
So then I...

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:25.965
brought you here?

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:29.335
You even told me the passcode and asked me to punch it in for you.

00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:31.005
Five, three, seven, nine.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.875
Gosh, seriously.

00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:42.855
Three consecutive receiving errors.

00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:46.055
Great idea.

00:15:47.225 --> 00:15:48.995
It's brilliant!

00:15:49.555 --> 00:15:53.095
To be honest, I was really touched by your words.

00:15:54.025 --> 00:15:55.535
What did I say?

00:15:57.395 --> 00:15:59.035
You said you'd make me rich.

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.075
You said I was your emotional baggage, didn't you?

00:16:02.675 --> 00:16:03.775
I did?

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:06.544
My friend, CEO Im!

00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:08.775
I always knew you'd be a big shot.

00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:12.315
Hey, what do you say we come up with our own secret handshake?

00:16:13.415 --> 00:16:17.315
Could you just pretend you never saw any of this?

00:16:17.415 --> 00:16:18.585
Come on.

00:16:19.155 --> 00:16:20.785
I'm not blind.

00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:23.655
I saw what I saw. How can I pretend I didn't?

00:16:26.525 --> 00:16:30.295
I've got a killer nose for money.

00:16:31.135 --> 00:16:33.505
The smell of us getting rich, CEO Im.

00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:37.205
But what is that smell?

00:16:38.105 --> 00:16:39.105
You smell that?

00:16:41.545 --> 00:16:44.245
That's the smell of us getting rich.

00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:51.115
Hey, this is a huge jackpot!

00:16:51.185 --> 00:16:55.055
This'll make us rich! You get it?

00:16:55.195 --> 00:16:56.955
How we'll grow this and cash in. Let's...

00:16:57.425 --> 00:16:59.695
meet up later and discuss it, okay?

00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:01.564
Wait. We came up...

00:17:01.565 --> 00:17:04.035
with this handshake, but how should we finish it?

00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:07.635
Got any ideas? I know it's a bit old-school,

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:09.675
but let's just go with this. Boom!

00:17:10.435 --> 00:17:12.375
We do this. Got it? Boom!

00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:18.885
We drank too much yesterday. Right? Go get some hangover food.

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:22.785
Hey, great idea. This mirror.

00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:25.425
Excellent. How clever.

00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:29.255
Darn it. If Seong Uk finds out, he's going to kill me.

00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:32.225
(14 missed calls from Jo Seong Uk)

00:17:33.765 --> 00:17:35.365
Darn it!

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:39.734
You're ignoring my calls?

00:17:39.735 --> 00:17:41.475
I got the gym back!

00:17:45.945 --> 00:17:47.675
I wasn't avoiding your calls on purpose.

00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:49.815
I kind of blacked out.

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:52.345
Hey, Seong Uk.

00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:56.255
What do you think about moving our office somewhere else?

00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:58.185
Why? Is something wrong?

00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:02.255
No, it's just that the ventilation isn't great and...

00:18:03.155 --> 00:18:04.225
Dong Hyeon.

00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:05.665
Stop rambling...

00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:08.395
and just focus on checking the list.

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:10.165
You know I'm counting on you, right?

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:12.305
You're good at this.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.035
Gosh, I'm completely swamped here.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:20.145
Thanks, Seong Uk. Drive safe.

00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.685
Park Min Ho, that little pest.

00:18:31.055 --> 00:18:32.055
Yes.

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:34.285
Prepare a funeral altar for me.

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:37.825
(Closed for renovations)

00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:40.125
Eight, one, three, seven, star.

00:18:40.465 --> 00:18:42.235
- The passcode has been changed. - Yes.

00:18:47.165 --> 00:18:49.204
When this jerk arrives in five minutes,

00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:51.305
make sure he's completely taken out so he can never come again.

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.345
I've turned off all the cameras, so you're clear. Got it?

00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:55.444
The longer the hospital stay, the higher the price.

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:56.445
Keep that in mind.

00:18:56.645 --> 00:18:57.815
Just make sure you do a thorough job.

00:18:58.215 --> 00:18:59.285
You should probably take that off.

00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.814
Hey, don't you worry. We've got a score to settle too.

00:19:01.815 --> 00:19:02.854
Darn him.

00:19:02.855 --> 00:19:03.855
(All in Gym)

00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:05.084
We're on scene.

00:19:05.085 --> 00:19:06.155
(Police)

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:11.055
- Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. - How can I help you, Officer?

00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:15.035
We received a report of an illegal gambling den at this location.

00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:16.295
A gambling den?

00:19:17.035 --> 00:19:19.504
Well, thanks for the consultation.

00:19:19.505 --> 00:19:21.835
I'll come back when I'm ready.

00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:25.105
- All right, take care now. - We're going to take a look inside.

00:19:25.645 --> 00:19:26.645
Of course.

00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:30.645
Who in the world would file a false report like that?

00:19:40.085 --> 00:19:42.295
What is it, Officer?

00:19:42.955 --> 00:19:43.955
What's the matter?

00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:51.665
It seems it was a false report, after all.

00:19:51.835 --> 00:19:54.335
I mean, of course. It's a gym. There's no way you'd find that here.

00:19:54.405 --> 00:19:56.035
- Thank you for your cooperation. - Of course.

00:20:04.175 --> 00:20:05.745
- Have a good day. - Yes, thank you.

00:20:06.845 --> 00:20:07.845
What?

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:17.895
He's one of your staff?

00:20:18.625 --> 00:20:19.695
You should've said so.

00:20:20.795 --> 00:20:21.935
Have a safe trip back.

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:25.165
Unbelievable.

00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:29.174
(Bring a Friend to the Gym!)

00:20:29.175 --> 00:20:30.275
Are they gone?

00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:35.645
The cops. They're gone, right?

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:38.985
Don't tell me you're the one who called them.

00:20:39.045 --> 00:20:42.415
No way. I was too busy dreaming about getting rich thanks to you.

00:20:42.485 --> 00:20:44.215
I was getting all giddy.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.985
I barely said a word to my college buddy about it.

00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:51.665
Gosh, but for him to stab me in the back like this?

00:20:53.165 --> 00:20:54.665
Just unbelievable.

00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:58.165
You can't trust anyone in this world, right?

00:20:58.935 --> 00:21:02.275
You haven't told anyone about this, have you?

00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:04.475
Of course not.

00:21:05.775 --> 00:21:06.875
CEO Im!

00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:09.215
Come on!

00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:13.945
Don't go around telling anyone this, you hear me?

00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:17.555
This is our little secret. All right?

00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:18.885
All right.

00:21:19.425 --> 00:21:22.195
Hey, we did this before, remember? This one.

00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:25.365
You want to go on top, or should I? You go on top.

00:21:25.795 --> 00:21:27.565
Slap, then grab.

00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:31.165
Boom! Rich guy!

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:33.835
Come on, do it with me. Rich guy!

00:21:36.305 --> 00:21:39.845
We're the only ones getting rich, got it?

00:21:43.645 --> 00:21:46.045
Feel free to work out here if you want, okay?

00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:48.155
Let's give this place a complete makeover.

00:21:51.315 --> 00:21:53.785
Why that little jerk...

00:22:03.395 --> 00:22:06.505
Gosh, it's tough trying to watch all of these at once.

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:08.535
Go Eun, can't you just narrow it down for us?

00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:11.605
No, sorry. You see the big picture when you see them all together.

00:22:11.675 --> 00:22:14.405
Watch closely again.

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:18.245
See? The coach, Jo Seong Uk, subtly gives a sign.

00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:21.285
And then they give up a point. Then another.

00:22:26.085 --> 00:22:29.455
The player acting on the sign is the same one every time.

00:22:30.325 --> 00:22:32.895
You're right. Number 17 was the one who gave up every point.

00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.395
Good! And that's our guy, Jeong Yeon Tae.

00:22:36.765 --> 00:22:38.965
He's a Jingwang University junior, playing libero.

00:22:39.135 --> 00:22:42.635
Sometimes it's hard to tell if he messed up or did it on purpose.

00:22:46.045 --> 00:22:49.275
- What a coincidence. - He wasn't going for the ball.

00:22:49.775 --> 00:22:51.415
He was going for the player.

00:22:51.615 --> 00:22:55.155
If he was going for the player, that means he tried to injure him.

00:22:55.985 --> 00:22:58.425
Looks like there was money in it for him.

00:22:59.155 --> 00:23:00.185

Darn. These jerks will stop at nothing for money.

00:23:11.935 --> 00:23:14.935
And their next game is the last one of the season.

00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:17.805
They'll try for one last big score, since it's the finale.

00:23:18.845 --> 00:23:20.045
That's actually perfect for us.

00:23:20.605 --> 00:23:23.115
Let's get their guy on our side.

00:23:24.215 --> 00:23:26.645

Sure, why not? I can have a meal with him.

You got a text.

00:36:01.705 --> 00:36:03.805
he frantically searched the Euro league.

00:36:04.235 --> 00:36:07.145
How is he falling for this so easily without any suspicion?

00:36:08.405 --> 00:36:10.715
I guess it's because he's young?

00:36:11.045 --> 00:36:13.845
Human psychology can be conveniently simple sometimes.

00:36:14.385 --> 00:36:17.415
- How so? - People doubt info that's given,

00:36:18.015 --> 00:36:19.825
but when it's information they've dug up themselves,

00:36:20.155 --> 00:36:21.625
they almost always believe it without a second thought.

00:36:22.695 --> 00:36:25.895
Jeong Yeon Tae figured out who I am through his own efforts,

00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:29.465
and he even did the legwork himself to find out what I'm up to.

00:36:30.035 --> 00:36:31.295
There's no way he'll doubt it.

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:34.105
After all, it's all information he discovered on his own.

00:36:34.735 --> 00:36:37.635
- So he trusts it completely. - I see.

00:36:37.975 --> 00:36:40.075
That's Lorenzo Kim for you.

00:36:40.675 --> 00:36:41.675
You could call it the moment...

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:44.075
the fake turns into the real thing.

00:36:45.175 --> 00:36:46.285
Message received.

00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:49.415
Now that we have someone on our side,

00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:52.085
shall we start placing some real bets?

00:37:05.195 --> 00:37:06.905
Isn't it a little public to be doing this?

00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:08.465
Cut the nonsense.

00:37:12.135 --> 00:37:13.145
Just take it.

00:37:18.015 --> 00:37:20.015
I'll get on the site and set it up by tomorrow.

00:37:20.245 --> 00:37:22.215
It's the last match of the season, so I'm going big.

00:37:22.655 --> 00:37:23.715
So stay sharp.

00:37:24.155 --> 00:37:25.155
Got it.

00:37:26.255 --> 00:37:27.755
Rich guy.

00:37:31.095 --> 00:37:34.565
I was over there ordering. I swear the small of your money...

00:37:35.395 --> 00:37:37.395
was stronger than the smell of fries.

00:37:38.265 --> 00:37:41.235
I had a hunch, and sure enough. You're impressive, CEO IM.

00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:49.645
Boom!

00:37:50.815 --> 00:37:52.815
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

00:37:54.215 --> 00:37:55.515
Nice catch!

00:37:56.015 --> 00:37:59.725
CEO Im, you nearly gave up on that, right?

00:38:01.385 --> 00:38:05.455
Or maybe not? Or was that my service ace?

00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:11.035
Sit down.

00:38:12.065 --> 00:38:14.934
I'm in an important meeting. I'll call you later.

00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:16.005
An important meeting?

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:19.545
I guess you hold important meetings over burgers these days.

00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:22.375
- I'll call you later, okay? - Yes.

00:38:22.715 --> 00:38:25.985
You're with someone. Got it. Sorry for interrupting.

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:29.515
Hang on.

00:38:31.315 --> 00:38:32.315
By any chance,

00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:35.995
aren't you the coach of the Jingwang University volleyball team?

00:38:36.655 --> 00:38:37.695
I'm right, aren't I?

00:38:37.955 --> 00:38:40.394
You are him!

00:38:40.395 --> 00:38:42.795
I thought you looked familiar. I knew it!

00:38:43.095 --> 00:38:44.995
Goodness, what an honour.

00:38:45.365 --> 00:38:48.205
I've just been so obsessed with volleyball lately.

00:38:48.535 --> 00:38:49.975
Would you just leave already?

00:38:50.075 --> 00:38:53.375
All right. But I'm a huge fan of the coach.

00:38:53.445 --> 00:38:57.515
If you don't mind, I'd love to treat you to a meal.

00:38:57.615 --> 00:38:59.385
My treat. I'll take you somewhere nice.

00:39:00.045 --> 00:39:03.155
After all, we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

00:39:07.585 --> 00:39:10.025
I'll let you get back to your important discussion.

00:39:11.055 --> 00:39:13.365
CEO Im, give me a call.

00:39:14.295 --> 00:39:15.325
Take care.

00:39:19.405 --> 00:39:20.405
Hey, Dong Hyeon.

00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:22.605
Be straight with me.

00:39:23.735 --> 00:39:25.135
Did you mess up again?

00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:26.945
Mess up? No.

00:39:27.745 --> 00:39:31.445
- I didn't. - Just be honest with me.

00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:37.285
The thing is,

00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:40.385
I went to a gambling den.

00:39:41.285 --> 00:39:43.295
That...

00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:45.825
That guy...

00:39:46.725 --> 00:39:49.365
He's the one who took my gym as collateral.

00:39:49.565 --> 00:39:52.434
And he even found our secret room.

00:39:52.435 --> 00:39:53.465
I'm sorry.

00:39:57.805 --> 00:39:59.375
(Jingwang University versus Hogyeong University)

00:40:01.545 --> 00:40:02.715
Goodness.

00:40:03.145 --> 00:40:06.015
The site's stakes are way higher than we expected.

00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:08.115
Gosh, how much is all this?

00:40:08.485 --> 00:40:12.355
With that much money on the line, I must be a big thorn in their side.

00:40:16.225 --> 00:40:17.225
It's Im Dong Hyeon.

00:40:21.395 --> 00:40:22.395
Rich guy.

00:40:22.765 --> 00:40:23.765
Clear your schedule.

00:40:24.535 --> 00:40:27.465
- My schedule? - You wanted to see the coach.

00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:30.375
Let's talk business over dinner.

00:40:30.805 --> 00:40:33.645
Sounds great. Send me the address.

00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:37.345
That arrogant jerk.

00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:39.915
I'll get the car ready.

00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:42.685
Hold on. We should take a different car.

00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:45.085
At the address Im Dong Hyeon gave me,

00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:46.425
there are no restaurants.

00:40:47.385 --> 00:40:49.525
I knew it. He wasn't just asking you to have dinner.

00:40:50.495 --> 00:40:53.025
We still have those used cars from Cha Byeong Jin, right?

00:40:53.225 --> 00:40:54.365
Get me one that wasn't flood-damaged.

00:41:19.115 --> 00:41:21.025
Why are they driving like this?

00:41:25.995 --> 00:41:27.795
Driver Kim, construction zone on your right.

00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:40.245
So this is why they wanted to meet here.

00:41:49.485 --> 00:41:51.555
Driver Kim, tow truck up ahead! Watch out!

00:41:56.425 --> 00:41:58.225
Driver Kim, it's blocked! Turn!

(Your vehicle has been safely towed.)

00:43:23.845 --> 00:43:25.575
- Yes. - What do you think?

00:43:25.815 --> 00:43:27.945
We killed and burned the body all at once.

00:43:28.485 --> 00:43:29.485
That's foolproof.

00:43:30.615 --> 00:43:32.615
Make sure you wrap up well. No loose ends.

00:43:32.825 --> 00:43:35.385
Okay, just wire me the money.

00:43:37.395 --> 00:43:38.695
Let's wrap this up!

00:43:40.165 --> 00:43:43.035
What did he say? Is it done? Is he dead?

00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:45.695
You think he could've survived that?

00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:51.435
He's definitely a goner.

00:43:57.415 --> 00:44:00.185
By the way, do you know what that jerk's name is?

00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:02.955
Park Min Ho.

00:44:15.095 --> 00:44:17.765
Do I need to know the jerk's name too?

00:44:18.035 --> 00:44:19.035
No.

00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:24.205
Okay.

00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:41.285
Driver Kim!

00:44:41.685 --> 00:44:44.755
- Driver Kim, are you okay? - Why ask? You know he's fine.

00:45:18.025 --> 00:45:19.025
Jo Seong Uk.

00:45:19.565 --> 00:45:21.595
I didn't expect him to be so bold with his attack.

00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:25.935
Now that they've made their move, it's our turn to strike.

00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:28.505
All right. Tomorrow, we unleash everything.

To be honest,

I've never been drafted into the pro leagues.

Why are you interested in me?

00:47:51.975 --> 00:47:53.515
Because you stood out to me.

You have great court vision, Yeon Tae.

- The tow... - Let me share a secret, CEO Im.

00:51:19.215 --> 00:51:21.085
That 50-50 split on the reward? It's off.

00:51:22.325 --> 00:51:23.425
It's all mine now.

00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:27.025
(2025 NUVF College Volleyball U-League, Finals)

00:51:29.725 --> 00:51:32.065
No way. The car blew up, so how is he alive?

00:51:34.265 --> 00:51:36.235
(2025 NUVF College Volleyball U-League, Finals)

00:51:37.775 --> 00:51:40.005
Yeon Tae. Jeong Yeon Tae.

00:51:44.645 --> 00:51:46.685
Jeong Yeon Tae, are you even trying to focus?

00:51:47.045 --> 00:51:49.885
Coach, sorry, but can you please just let me play for real this once?

00:51:49.955 --> 00:51:52.555
What kind of nonsense is that? You're a talentless hack.

00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:55.755
- I do have skills. - Who says?

00:51:56.855 --> 00:52:00.065
Not a single team drafted you. So who told you you're any good?

00:52:01.265 --> 00:52:04.495
There might be a chance for me in the major leagues in Europe.

00:52:07.365 --> 00:52:09.835
You've really lost it. Hey.

00:52:10.535 --> 00:52:14.005
How many Korean liberos do you think have ever made it to Europe?

00:52:14.675 --> 00:52:17.175
Not a single one. Not even one.

00:52:17.975 --> 00:52:20.315
Then I could be the first, Coach.

00:52:23.385 --> 00:52:24.415
Yeon Tae.

00:52:25.315 --> 00:52:27.125
The next set is really important.

00:52:27.525 --> 00:52:29.185
If you don't want to mess up your life,

00:52:29.555 --> 00:52:32.655
just do as I say. Got it?

00:52:35.795 --> 00:52:36.835
Good.

00:52:37.165 --> 00:52:39.365
I'm counting on you. Now go.

00:52:44.235 --> 00:52:45.775
Let's go!

00:52:46.775 --> 00:52:48.405
Let's do this!

00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:58.355
Yeon Tae.

00:52:58.615 --> 00:53:00.225
You're doing great.

00:53:12.435 --> 00:53:13.435
Play.

00:53:13.765 --> 00:53:14.835
Nice one.

00:53:20.505 --> 00:53:21.505
Nice!

00:53:23.445 --> 00:53:25.215
(Invincible Jingwang's lucky charm, Jeong Yeon Tae)

00:53:27.115 --> 00:53:29.185
- Yeon Tae... - Mine!

00:53:31.385 --> 00:53:32.915
- Nice! - Yes, that's it!

00:53:32.985 --> 00:53:34.355
- That's it. - Cover!

00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:39.195
Go!

00:53:42.995 --> 00:53:44.695
(Invincible Jingwang's lucky charm, Jeong Yeon Tae)

00:53:44.735 --> 00:53:45.965
- Jeong Yeon Tae! - Jeong Yeon Tae!

00:53:47.265 --> 00:53:48.434
(Jingwang University versus Hogyeong University)

00:53:48.435 --> 00:53:49.865
(Payout: 167,000 dollars)

00:53:54.805 --> 00:53:57.475
Jeong Yeon Tae! Let's go!

00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:08.425
Darn it.

00:54:12.795 --> 00:54:16.295
Now that they've made their move, it's our turn to strike.

00:54:16.595 --> 00:54:19.295
All right. Tomorrow, we unleash everything.

00:54:23.005 --> 00:54:24.505
For that one moment of wavering,

00:54:25.475 --> 00:54:27.145
we have to focus everything.

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:30.715
(Park Min Ho)

00:54:31.215 --> 00:54:32.715
Get the one in front! Cover!

00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:44.995
How dare worthless trash like you defy me?

00:54:46.455 --> 00:54:47.895
I'm holding a press conference immediately.

00:54:48.525 --> 00:54:51.935
- What? - I recorded everything you said.

00:54:52.835 --> 00:54:54.205
Everything. From the very beginning.

00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:55.835
Jeong Yeon Tae, you...

00:54:56.465 --> 00:54:57.805
What do you want from me?

00:54:58.175 --> 00:55:00.275
What is it you want from me, jerk?

00:55:01.345 --> 00:55:02.345
What do I want?

00:55:05.545 --> 00:55:06.675
There's definitely something I want.

00:55:08.645 --> 00:55:10.415
Apologise to Park Min Ho.

00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:14.885
What?

00:55:25.635 --> 00:55:26.635
What?

00:55:38.115 --> 00:55:39.575
For that one moment of wavering,

00:55:40.215 --> 00:55:41.915
we have to focus everything.

00:55:44.955 --> 00:55:45.985
What?

00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:48.055
What's going on? Park...

00:55:48.755 --> 00:55:50.754
I thought you said Park Min Ho was dead!

00:55:50.755 --> 00:55:51.825
Park Min Ho? What are you talking about?

00:55:51.855 --> 00:55:55.795
The tow truck. You said it flipped and, you blew it up!

00:55:58.795 --> 00:56:00.435
We saw the pictures together!

00:56:01.805 --> 00:56:02.905
You think he could've survived that?

00:56:03.035 --> 00:56:04.205
He's definitely a goner.

00:56:05.235 --> 00:56:06.235
Get out of my way.

00:56:06.975 --> 00:56:10.445
But how is Park Min Ho still alive?

00:56:16.985 --> 00:56:21.155
Hey, Park Min Ho... He's right here.

00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:22.225
Get out of my way!

00:56:41.375 --> 00:56:43.445
Hey! Who on earth are you?

00:56:43.715 --> 00:56:45.515
Who on earth are you, you crazy jerk?

00:56:55.885 --> 00:56:58.795
(Park Min Ho)

00:56:59.555 --> 00:57:00.565
(Park Min Ho)

00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:02.295
No.

00:57:04.835 --> 00:57:05.835
It can't be.

00:57:09.335 --> 00:57:12.635
It can't be. Park Min Ho is dead!

00:57:13.235 --> 00:57:15.575
Park Min Ho is dead! Darn it!

00:57:17.445 --> 00:57:18.975
No way. This can't be happening.

00:57:24.785 --> 00:57:26.615
And the autopsy report? Who did they ID the body as?

00:57:27.425 --> 00:57:29.984
Park Min Ho, a volleyball player of Jingwang University.

00:57:29.985 --> 00:57:31.195
- Park Min Ho? - Yes.

00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:36.425
We're taking Coach Jo Seong Uk of Jingwang University into custody.

00:57:39.695 --> 00:57:41.465
How did they manage it with the body?

00:57:41.765 --> 00:57:42.765
The body!

00:57:44.735 --> 00:57:45.775
How did they do it?

00:57:52.445 --> 00:57:53.445
Where did they...

00:58:00.555 --> 00:58:04.125
This can't be right. Only we knew about this. Right?

00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:07.995
- Seong Uk, you need to calm down. - But I just got here.

00:58:08.725 --> 00:58:09.895
I'll go check for myself.

00:58:16.935 --> 00:58:20.235
(The grave of Baek Seon Ja)

00:58:49.965 --> 00:58:50.975
It's here!

00:58:51.975 --> 00:58:53.075
Park Min Ho is here!

00:59:02.315 --> 00:59:03.515
Park Min Ho is here!

00:59:05.815 --> 00:59:07.485
You had me so worried! Darn it.

00:59:11.595 --> 00:59:14.895
Hey, I found him. Min Ho was right here.

00:59:19.865 --> 00:59:20.905
I've found him.

00:59:21.805 --> 00:59:22.805
Park Min Ho.

00:59:24.475 --> 00:59:26.535
So you dug him up yourself just to make sure.

00:59:33.215 --> 00:59:35.285
No, that's not it.

00:59:35.815 --> 00:59:37.155
Let's meet face-to-face soon.

01:00:27.505 --> 01:00:29.535
It feels good to be outside after being cooped up...

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:30.835
in a hospital room, right?

01:00:33.635 --> 01:00:35.575
Take a nice, deep breath.

01:00:40.545 --> 01:00:41.545
The sky?

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:45.515
That's right.

01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:49.955
Min Ho said he loved a sky just like this, didn't he?

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:54.895
Come to think of it,

01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:57.135
just as Min Ho said,

01:00:57.965 --> 01:01:01.405
the sky really does look like one giant volleyball court.

01:01:16.685 --> 01:01:18.715
The sky is so beautiful.

01:01:20.785 --> 01:01:21.885
Seong Cheol.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:27.865
Yes?

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:08.435
(Special thanks to our guest star, Um Mun Suk)

01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:23.545
(Taxi Driver 3)

01:02:23.815 --> 01:02:27.925
Someone else was involved in Park Min Ho's death?

01:02:28.855 --> 01:02:30.155
From now on, I'll take care...

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.825
of your futures.

01:02:31.995 --> 01:02:35.325
Cheon Gwang Jin. He thinks without restraint and is dangerous.

01:02:35.395 --> 01:02:36.465
Who are you?

01:02:36.525 --> 01:02:39.365
Me? I'm Park Min Ho.

01:02:39.395 --> 01:02:42.365
What are you talking about? Park Min Ho's body was stolen?

01:02:42.435 --> 01:02:45.535
- Min Ho. Long time no see. - How about we meet and talk?

01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:47.475
Be late, and you'll never find Min Ho's bones.

01:02:51.915 --> 01:02:52.915
You're too slow.
