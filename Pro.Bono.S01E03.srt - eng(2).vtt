PRO BONO

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.950
It's been a while,

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:55.535
Mr. Yoo Jae-beom.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.165
Yes, it has been a while, Ms. Oh.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.543
Sir, please drive safely.

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:17.515
All right, Detective Woo.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.893
There are tons
of pork rind places in Mapo-dong,

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.769
but this place is the most legit.

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:22.729
Okay?

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:23.938
Here.

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.025
Here. Have a piece.

00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:29.402
Right here!

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:34.782
This was right where I was scammed.

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:37.619
How could a judge like you get scammed?

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:41.080
He pretended to be a hometown buddy
and ran after borrowing money from you?

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.126
I was never going to come back here but…

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.130
So, where is that rotten Yoo Jae-beom
right now?

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:51.090
He was hiding in Cambodia.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:53.843
Then, he entered Korea a year ago
with a forged passport.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.221
-His whereabouts are unknown after that.
-Really?

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.017
And then, he approached me.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.020
He even knew about my first crush.

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.147
How in the world
did he find out about my history?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.776
Actually,

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.362
I have a question to ask you.

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:14.197
Me? What is it?

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:18.660
When Yoo Jae-beom
entered Korea at Incheon Airport,

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:21.204
he got a burner phone
with his forged passport.

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.164
-I looked through the call history.
-And?

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:26.334
And one number popped up frequently.

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:39.097
-This number…
-Yes.

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:41.891
Located in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul,

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.519
at Seoul Central District Court's
Criminal Division,

00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:46.938
it's Chief Judge Kang Da-wit's office.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.107
That's your number, right?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.733
What are you talking about?

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:54.404
Why would I talk on the phone
with that punk? I've never called…

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.366
Your classmate
from elementary school called.

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.287
"Kim Ju-seop"? Who's that?

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.873
-He said "Juvenile" would ring a bell.
-Juvenile?

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.002
Right. Kim Juvenile.

00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:14.090
What? Did you remember something?

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:19.804
Good morning!

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:23.349
Sir, have you agreed
to the screening process?

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:24.434
No way.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.401
PRO BONO

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.986
COURT IN SESSION

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.115
-Byeol!
-Byeol!

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.369
Thank you so much, Mr. Kang.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.788
We can't thank you enough.

00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.373
Honestly. Thank you, everyone.

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:50.209
Byeol!

00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:52.879
I thought we would never see her again.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:55.506
Thank you.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:59.344
But is it really all over now?

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.638
What if they appeal and harass us again?

00:04:02.722 --> 00:04:04.807
Don't worry. They can't appeal.

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:06.768
Just trust me.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.644
I'll protect you.

00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:20.573
Let's go.

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:27.663
Ms. Park.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.708
Why are you blushing?

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:33.127
-What?
-Do you have a fever?

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:38.424
No, it's all right.
I don't have a fever. I'm fine.

00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:42.136
What was that reaction?

00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:46.182
All right. If you're fine, then good.

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:47.266
Geez.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.267
Let's go, then.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.644
Let's go.

00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:54.232
The reason why they can't appeal is

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:57.151
they changed their words,
so their accusation doesn't stand.

00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:01.197
-Byeol did a good job too.
-This isn't good.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.117
My heart is acting up again.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:06.744
The heart of a nerd.

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:10.206
Wingardium Leviosa!

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:12.708
Wingardium Leviosa!

00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:15.253
Lumos!

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.090
Wingardium Leviosa!

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:23.886
Wingardium Leviosa!

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.268
When I went to court
for the first time in my life,

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:33.187
it was nothing but a scary place.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.399
Wingardium Leviosa.

00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.192
The Court rules…

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:43.698
Mom!

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.578
The spell cast by the judge in that moment

00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:51.873
was more incredible than any other spell

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:54.500
from Harry Potter.

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:59.505
CRIMINAL LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:04.594
"Guardians must raise their children
according to their developmental stages

00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:07.680
in a safe and healthy manner in the home."

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.057
Article 99 of the Civil Code defines

00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.143
movable and immovable assets.

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:13.686
Then, in that case,

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:17.440
is Howl's Moving Castle
a movable asset or an immovable asset?

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.776
Howl's Moving…

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.861
And my second question.

00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.197
Park Gi-ppeum.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.489
Yes, Professor?

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:28.034
-You did great on the interview.
-Thank you, sir.

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:30.786
Now that the interview is over,
let's talk freely.

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:32.997
Why do you want to practice law?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.916
This is an industry in decline now.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.419
As I said earlier,
I want to protect basic human rights

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:41.214
-and social justice--
-Come on. The interview's over.

00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:43.007
Not that stuff. The real reason.

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:48.429
-That's the real reason.
-Okay, then.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:51.015
But being a nerd and reality
were two different things.

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:53.309
After that,
nothing had made my heart pound

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.645
for a very long time.

00:06:56.771 --> 00:06:59.065
-But…
-This poor abandoned dog

00:06:59.148 --> 00:07:01.192
was brutally abused and thrown out.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:05.988
Is she really the dog you lost?

00:07:06.072 --> 00:07:08.032
No! No, it's not mine.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:10.534
My heart raced in that moment…

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:12.536
for a split second.

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:16.123
Geez.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.000
Forget about it,

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:19.710
and just trust me.

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:22.213
I mean, what's there to worry about?

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:24.298
Kang Da-wit, the people's judge, is here.

00:07:24.382 --> 00:07:27.510
Of course, your skills are incredible.

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:30.179
-I admire you. I really do.
-Then, what's the problem?

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:33.975
Doing this international patent case
worth trillions

00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:37.937
that's between conglomerates
doesn't seem right.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.982
We're a pro bono team, after all.

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:43.818
Geez. This is so frustrating.

00:07:45.361 --> 00:07:46.654
What's public interest?

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:49.240
We're one team now,

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:51.993
so let's speak honestly.

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:54.370
If we win and make a lot of money,

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.622
where does that money go?

00:07:56.706 --> 00:08:00.626
The money circulates, so the common folk
and disadvantaged will benefit from it.

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:04.922
Making money is
the most pro bono thing we can do.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.882
Day and night, we do these.

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.594
These cases don't even make money.

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:11.220
We expend energy for nothing.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:13.514
Why on earth do we do these?

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:15.224
What's this? A refugee case?

00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:17.935
Young people are livid
that they can't find jobs these days.

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:20.980
Who'd be happy
about foreigners coming in?

00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:24.525
What else? Human rights for people
with disabilities? It sounds wonderful.

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.819
Right? But whenever people
with disabilities protest,

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:29.822
do you know how angry people get
when they can't properly commute?

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:33.409
God, instead of stuff like this,

00:08:33.492 --> 00:08:34.952
let's do something classy--

00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:38.080
I can't listen to this anymore!

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:43.628
Do I have to keep listening to him deny
the very existence of pro bono cases?

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:45.004
What? You have nothing to say?

00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:47.506
Am I the only one who's uncomfortable?

00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:49.508
Come on, Ms. Yoo.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.094
Why does everything
make you so uncomfortable?

00:08:52.178 --> 00:08:55.014
If you're uncomfortable,
go and sit somewhere comfortable.

00:09:00.603 --> 00:09:02.188
You stupid boomer!

00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:04.690
What?

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:06.108
"Stupid boomer"?

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:07.902
Unbelievable.

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.111
What? "Boomer"?

00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:11.113
I've never been called that before.

00:09:11.197 --> 00:09:13.574
Hey, Ms. Yoo. What did you say? "Boomer"?

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:14.492
What?

00:09:14.575 --> 00:09:17.912
Back in my day, you wouldn't dare
speak that way to senior colleagues!

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:20.373
-My heart of a nerd…
-"Boomer?" Man, things have changed.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:22.249
It must have been a false alarm.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.877
No wonder they say
face reading was a science.

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.505
He didn't seem right from the start.

00:09:27.588 --> 00:09:28.839
Excuse me, Mr. Kang.

00:09:28.923 --> 00:09:30.883
Which graduating class
are you from, Ms. Yoo?

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.635
-Mr. Kang.
-Ms. Yoo--

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:37.807
What now, Ms. Park?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.851
Why did you come to Team Pro Bono?

00:09:45.314 --> 00:09:46.524
Why are you suddenly asking?

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:49.193
You said it yourself.

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:52.113
You used to handle only the classy cases.

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:55.533
Why did you quit being a judge

00:09:55.616 --> 00:09:56.992
and come here?

00:09:58.786 --> 00:10:00.246
Did you know, Mr. Kang?

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:03.416
If there are people in this world
who always win,

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:06.377
there are people who always lose as well.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.047
No matter how hard they try,
they're too weak to fight the world.

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:13.008
Pro bono attorneys exist
to help people like them,

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:17.680
not to handle classy cases
or cases they always win.

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:24.145
Why do you think I wouldn't know

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.273
about the ones who always lose?

00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:31.152
The ones too weak to fight the world,
no matter how hard they try.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.321
You think I don't know?

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.371
But do you know what it's like, Ms. Park?

00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:44.957
Have you even tried
to earn your own tuition yourself?

00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:47.418
You're crossing the line, Mr. Kang.

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:49.545
Right. This is an uncomfortable question.

00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:52.006
You must've been offended.
Sorry. Excuse me.

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:54.884
No. Thanks to my parents,

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:57.386
I grew up comfortably
and was raised by a loving family.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.554
Yes, I can surely tell.

00:10:58.637 --> 00:11:00.347
And what about it?

00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:02.183
Is that a problem?

00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:03.267
No, who says it is?

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.061
That's great. Gosh, how amazing.

00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:09.440
Someone raised with love
is worrying about the people in need.

00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:11.901
How honorable.
Any thoughts of becoming a politician?

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:14.028
I'll help you.
I have a lot of connections.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.280
Oh, my gosh!

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:17.907
Ms. Park.

00:11:23.078 --> 00:11:24.288
2025 SEOUL QUEER FESTIVAL

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:30.336
Follow me.
You have to come to see me, sister.

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:33.005
I wish we could get married.

00:11:33.088 --> 00:11:37.259
We're just a tiny bit different.
That's all.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:39.053
Please try to understand.

00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:41.138
We'll walk you down the aisle!

00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:42.306
We're with you.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:43.891
Please give us a hug!

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:47.144
We as attorneys support LGBTQIA+ rights.

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:48.687

00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:50.272

Let's make a world without discrimination.

00:11:52.858 --> 00:11:54.360
Yeah. Please sign.

-Free T-shirts!

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:04.119
Free T-shirt. Your signature.

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:06.789
Geez, we're attorneys.
What are we doing here?

00:12:06.872 --> 00:12:10.626
One of the main jobs of pro bono attorneys
is supporting human rights groups.

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:12.545
We're with you.

00:12:14.088 --> 00:12:15.673
Come get a T-shirt!

00:12:18.926 --> 00:12:20.886
Damn. This isn't working.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.805
-It's not working, is it?
-No, this won't do.

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:25.766
-We shouldn't act like attorneys here.
-You're right.

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:27.184
Yes. Let's get going.

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:29.061
What?

00:12:29.937 --> 00:12:30.896
What is it?

00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:33.274
Follow us!

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:34.817
Geez!

00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:37.236
-What is it?
-Nan-hui!

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:39.989
GET A T-SHIRT BY DONATING
AND TAKING OUR SURVEY

00:12:40.072 --> 00:12:42.825
-Okay, come on out.
-Hey!

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:48.455
I'm a public figure.
What if someone recognizes--

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:51.250
If you're at a festival,
you should dress for the occasion.

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.044
Occasion, my foot. You really think
people would come for this?

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:55.671
Could we take a photo with you?

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:57.172
Please, just one!

00:12:57.256 --> 00:12:58.257
-They came.
-I'll take it.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.884
-Thank you!
-Okay. One, two, three.

00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:02.970
You look so pretty!

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:04.972
You're so beautiful.

00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:08.225
No, I'm a real manly man.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.560
Why am I speaking like this?

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:11.353
-We'll root you. Good luck.
-Good luck.

00:13:11.437 --> 00:13:13.939
Excuse me, could you come over here
and sign your names?

00:13:14.023 --> 00:13:15.608
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.610
Sign here and take your T-shirts.

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:18.861
Ms. Yoo, give me my pants.

00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:19.945
We want a photo too!

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:21.405
Please take a photo with us!

00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:24.033
-Could you take it for us?
-Should I take it? Okay.

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:25.784
Here we go. One, two, three.

00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:28.621
-Thank you. Now, stop.
-One, two, three. Great!

00:13:28.704 --> 00:13:29.997
-Ms. Yoo.
-Smile!

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.666
-Can't we take a few more, please?
-My goodness.

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:34.960
One, two, three.

00:13:35.044 --> 00:13:37.171
That's enough, Ms. Yoo. Thank you.

00:13:37.254 --> 00:13:39.214
Let's take it together!

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:40.424
Together!

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:42.301
Okay. That's enough, Ms. Yoo!

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:47.306
Great. We'll all take one together.

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:49.391
-Okay, one, two, three!
-Me too!

00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:50.434
Let me join you!

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:52.061
-Here we go.
-How many are we taking?

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:54.396
I'll take it now. Everyone, smile!

00:13:58.275 --> 00:13:59.818
Listen, Ms. Park.

00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:02.529
Do you intend to drag me along
to these random places all day?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.449
-You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
-My gosh.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:08.410
What do you mean? This is the daily life
of a pro bono attorney.

00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:12.206
When there's a question on legal issues,
we have to answer them.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:15.501
Of course,

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:19.171
that is if there is a question.

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:24.468
-Sorry.
-It's empty.

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:27.471
I worked really hard
to prepare a press release too.

00:14:28.347 --> 00:14:29.431
It's all right.

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:30.349
Attorney Kang!

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.728
Are you okay?

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:37.731
I'm okay. How was the festival?

00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.067
Wait, what's going on?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.819
Hold on. Let's go.

00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:44.571
Wait, what is it?

00:14:45.072 --> 00:14:46.198
Hello.

00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:47.908
How have you been?

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:51.203
Mr. Jang must have brought
a reporter he knows again.

00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:52.746
He did this last time too.

00:14:54.873 --> 00:14:57.084
"Mushrooms" has more connections
than I thought.

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:59.378
-Let's go!
-He knows everyone here.

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:01.755
In this field, Mr. Jang

00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:03.799
-is a legend.
-What?

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:07.094
Back in college,
he fought against hired thugs

00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:09.138
at the site of an illegal slum clearance,

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:12.516
and he was such a menace
that even the thugs were scared.

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.101
-Attorney Jang?
-Yes.

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:16.687
No way. That's nonsense.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.480
But that suit…

00:15:18.564 --> 00:15:20.441
Though it looks worn out,

00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:24.737
it's similar to the Italian luxury brand
that I saw at a Cheongdam-dong boutique.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.488
Is it a knockoff?

00:15:27.364 --> 00:15:28.907
Could I ask you a question?

00:15:28.991 --> 00:15:30.534
Yes, go ahead.

00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:31.910
Okay.

00:15:31.994 --> 00:15:33.245
Nice to meet you.

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.706
I'm journalist Ko Il-ju
of Stepping Forward Together.

00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:39.126
Geez, the only one person
who came is a journalist

00:15:39.209 --> 00:15:41.045
from a labor movement organization.

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:44.006
They're basically peas in a pod.

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:50.763
Hey, Jung-in. I was going to call you.
I'm trying to cooperate as you told me to,

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:52.139
but do I really have to--

00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:53.724
You want us to come back?

00:15:54.892 --> 00:15:58.604
Ms. Park. She wants us to come back.
Hurry up. Let's go!

00:15:58.687 --> 00:15:59.730
Where are you going?

00:16:02.232 --> 00:16:04.735
The jury trial of the abandoned dog case

00:16:04.818 --> 00:16:06.987
has become the talk of the town.

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:10.032
The fact that Oh & Partners,
Korea's top major law firm,

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:13.911
defended the case for free
has grabbed people's attention.

00:16:13.994 --> 00:16:16.497
To be honest, for the common folk,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.749
they think of Oh & Partners
as being so high up there

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:21.043
that you can't even be reached.

00:16:22.711 --> 00:16:24.880
Yes. People have thought of us that way.

00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:25.798
We admit it.

00:16:26.423 --> 00:16:29.051
But the world has changed now, hasn't it?

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:34.014
So we must change as well.
It'd be no fun for us to miss out

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:36.934
on social responsibility
and the changing times.

00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:40.479
We hope you look forward
to the new Oh & Partners.

00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:43.732
Isn't the fact
that a young female attorney

00:16:43.816 --> 00:16:47.861
has become CEO
a shocking change in itself?

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:56.036
I'm going to create a world
where my age and gender

00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:59.164
doesn't become a news topic.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.624
I see.

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.709
That's amazing.

00:17:02.793 --> 00:17:05.879
Also, Attorney Kang Da-wit,
who's known as "the people's judge,"

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.131
took on the case.

00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:09.424
I heard you two trained
at the JRTI together.

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:12.553
Could you tell me a bit
about how you were able to recruit him?

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:15.889
Well, you can ask him that for yourself.

00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:18.767
Should we take a break?

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:21.812
My goodness.

00:17:22.437 --> 00:17:24.314
You're good at your job, Ms. Oh.

00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:26.483
You were pretty good
at answering questions too.

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:29.403
You still have the vibes
of "the people's judge."

00:17:29.987 --> 00:17:31.697
There's something I'm curious about.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.948
What is it?

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.200
Why haven't you asked me?

00:17:35.784 --> 00:17:36.618
About what?

00:17:41.498 --> 00:17:44.334
You haven't asked me once
about what made me quit as a judge.

00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:49.214
Have you seen the video, by any chance?

00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:57.890
Do I have to know about it?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.934
What?

00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:03.979
You still don't get it.

00:18:05.898 --> 00:18:08.192
Do you know how many people work here?

00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:10.944
We have more than 1,000 attorneys.

00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:15.324
Including paralegals, secretaries,
and other staff, how many does that make?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.327
Do you know how many of them
are former justices,

00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:23.207
chief prosecutors, government ministers,
tax commissioners, and bank CEOs?

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:27.252
The politicians who fought us
in the name of democracy

00:18:27.336 --> 00:18:29.338
and so-called moral compass journalists.

00:18:29.421 --> 00:18:32.966
We make them advisors, and they diligently
come to work and get paid.

00:18:34.843 --> 00:18:39.932
Oh & Partners is basically Korea.
Do you understand?

00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:50.484
Sorry, Da-wit.

00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:55.697
I don't have enough free time
to worry about each employee's situation.

00:18:56.949 --> 00:18:59.284
Well, have a good day.

00:19:13.215 --> 00:19:14.508
Hello, Mr. Kang.

00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:17.344
-Hi. Where are the others?
-They're out on business.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:19.638
-You were great on the news yesterday.
-Thank you.

00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:22.557
By the way, someone saw the interview
and came looking for you.

00:19:22.641 --> 00:19:24.434
He insisted on meeting you.

00:19:24.518 --> 00:19:25.352
What?

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:34.528
Who are you suing again?

00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:35.654
God.

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.115
I just told you.

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:40.826
Are you a Christian? Catholic?

00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:41.827
Neither.

00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:44.371
You can't trust anyone in this world.

00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:45.831
I don't believe in anything.

00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:47.749
Then why?

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:49.960
I want compensation for damages.

00:19:50.544 --> 00:19:51.628
A huge sum.

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:55.132
Damages?
That's a civil case, not a criminal one.

00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:58.010
Okay, then. What did God do wrong to you?

00:19:59.303 --> 00:20:01.847
He brought me into this world.

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:05.058
-What?
-I never asked

00:20:05.684 --> 00:20:07.644
to be born this way.

00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:10.022
No one wanted me…

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:13.025
to be born at all,

00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:14.484
including my mom

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.695
and my dad, who I've never met.

00:20:17.946 --> 00:20:20.282
So, please represent me for free.

00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:23.660
You said you'd do it.

00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:24.578
I did?

00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:27.539
I left the court that I'd devoted
my entire life to

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.041
because I just humbly

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.129
want to be there
for people who are in pain.

00:20:34.212 --> 00:20:36.506
When those who are without help

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.258
and who are vulnerable come to me,

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:42.429
I'll help them
with legal knowledge and experience

00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.097
I've gained throughout my life.

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:49.811
Well, I don't think you understand
because you're young.

00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.855
But a trial can only happen
when it makes sense

00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:54.232
and when there's a chance to win.

00:20:54.316 --> 00:20:57.778
Isn't it your job as an attorney
to make sense out of it?

00:20:57.861 --> 00:20:59.529
Are you an attorney? Why are you arguing?

00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:02.407
Whatever.
Just take on my case for damages.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.326
So what is it?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.330
Are your hospital bills the loss
that God needs to compensate?

00:21:10.165 --> 00:21:12.084
I can't be cured anyways.

00:21:13.251 --> 00:21:14.169
I was…

00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:19.841
born paralyzed from the waist down.

00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:25.263
Okay, so what damages--

00:21:25.347 --> 00:21:27.933
I already told you.
The fact that I was born.

00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:31.937
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:35.857
It would've been much better

00:21:36.441 --> 00:21:38.402
if I'd never been born at all.

00:21:49.955 --> 00:21:54.584
-Did you send him away?
-I finally did. What a stubborn kid.

00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:57.337
I don't know how he got here
when he lives in Bucheon.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:59.214
Bucheon? You sent him off alone?

00:21:59.297 --> 00:22:00.757
I grabbed him a large cab.

00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:03.468
I paid the driver generously
with my own money.

00:22:03.552 --> 00:22:05.137
Yeah? Good job.

00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:07.639
-Sir.
-What is it?

00:22:07.722 --> 00:22:10.308
He was a guest who came for you.

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:12.644
Guest, my foot. So?

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:18.275
I paid a generous amount to take him
all the way to Bucheon, which is…

00:22:18.358 --> 00:22:19.901
Okay. Good job.

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:23.029
-Right.
-Do you have something to say?

00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:25.657
No, sir.

00:22:27.784 --> 00:22:29.244
Let's go and grab some soju.

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:30.829
What? Okay!

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:45.927
I already told you.
The fact that I was born.

00:22:47.012 --> 00:22:49.890
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:53.476
Gosh, what an awful thing
for a child to say.

00:22:54.686 --> 00:22:56.605
You feel bad for him, don't you?

00:22:57.439 --> 00:23:00.650
These pro bono cases tend to be…

00:23:01.526 --> 00:23:04.404
Of course, these cases must be new to you,

00:23:04.487 --> 00:23:06.198
-so it must be--
-They're not my first.

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:07.866
Sorry?

00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:11.036
When I was first appointed,
I was at a small court and did everything.

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:12.621
When I was an associate judge,

00:23:12.704 --> 00:23:15.373
I oversaw rehabilitation
and bankruptcy cases too.

00:23:15.457 --> 00:23:17.876
But gosh, I couldn't bear them.

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:20.045
Because there were too many cases?

00:23:20.128 --> 00:23:22.130
Well, that was part of it.

00:23:22.214 --> 00:23:24.883
But every day, people would go bankrupt,

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:26.760
get sick, or commit suicide.

00:23:26.843 --> 00:23:28.720
That was all I saw every day,

00:23:29.512 --> 00:23:30.513
so it was tough.

00:23:31.765 --> 00:23:33.725
Even if you manage to put out the fires,

00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:35.310
they're bound to keep happening.

00:23:35.393 --> 00:23:36.436
You're right.

00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:40.357
That's why I want cases
that involve people with money and power.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.692
That might be easier on my mind.

00:23:43.318 --> 00:23:44.945
And…

00:23:45.028 --> 00:23:46.780
I'd make more money too.

00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:50.242
Geez. Here.

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:52.661
Thank you, sir.

00:24:04.547 --> 00:24:07.300
-Wait, let's grab a beer…
-Beer, my foot.

00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:09.803
Hey, this is for the taxi.

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:16.518
-It only costs me 20,000 won to get home.
-Yeah, bring back the change tomorrow.

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:21.064
Thank you, Da-wit!

00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:22.440
Get home safely!

00:24:22.524 --> 00:24:24.067
I'll see you tomorrow!

00:24:24.776 --> 00:24:27.279
Geez. What an exhausting guy.

00:24:34.035 --> 00:24:35.036
Hey, how did it go?

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.830
I followed her after work.

00:24:36.913 --> 00:24:39.457
She went to a VIP room
in Sejin University Hospital.

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:41.668
She's coming out now.

00:24:42.252 --> 00:24:44.337
She probably went to see her grandmother.

00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.131
Did she need more money for the hospital?

00:24:46.214 --> 00:24:49.384
-Should I keep following her?
-Yeah, keep tabs on her for now.

00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:51.720
Find out who she's meeting with.

00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:53.930
There must be someone else.

00:24:55.432 --> 00:24:56.516
Judge Kang.

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.436
I'm grateful you sent me to jail
to knock sense into me

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:02.772
and for finding me a job later on.

00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:06.234
But aren't you making me work
too much right now?

00:25:07.402 --> 00:25:10.864
-You're going to pay me well, right?
-Cut it out. Bye.

00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:16.202
Geez.

00:25:17.912 --> 00:25:18.747
Taxi!

00:25:19.414 --> 00:25:20.248
Hello.

00:25:21.916 --> 00:25:23.043
Sadang-dong, please.

00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:25.462
Sir, could you…

00:25:30.925 --> 00:25:32.052
THIS IS A DEAF TAXI DRIVER

00:25:32.135 --> 00:25:33.011
I see.

00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:36.348
Sadang Station, Exit 2.

00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:39.642
The ride has begun.

00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:43.063
Please wear your seatbelt for your safety.

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:50.445
DRIVER'S MESSAGE
TAP ARM TO PULL OVER

00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:04.584
Please take all your belongings
before you leave.

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:10.173
Sir.

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:12.801
Thank you very much.

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:23.997
I said no.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.915
-You said you'd do it.
-When did I ever?

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:28.585
-Should I play the video again?
-That was just for TV.

00:27:28.668 --> 00:27:31.379
Are judges allowed to go on TV and lie?

00:27:31.463 --> 00:27:34.466
When did I ever lie?
Also, I'm not a judge. I'm an attorney.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:36.593
Then, I'll go on TV too.

00:27:36.676 --> 00:27:40.805
I'll go and ask if it's all right
for an attorney to lie on TV.

00:27:40.889 --> 00:27:43.016
Are you an attorney?
Why do you keep arguing with me?

00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:44.058
Come here.

00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:45.602
-Goodness.
-He's fast.

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:49.189
Come here. Let's send you home…

00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:50.440
Who's the real attorney here?

00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:51.649
-That kid is.
-Hey.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.319
Geez!

00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:56.070
Good morning, sir.

00:27:57.197 --> 00:27:58.448
It's not a good morning.

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.247
Occupied.

00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:09.459
It's occupied.

00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:10.376
I know.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.129
You little…

00:28:14.964 --> 00:28:16.591
Here you go.

00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:24.516
I grabbed all the desserts I could find
around here.

00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:26.976
-Do you like this one the most?
-Yes.

00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:30.438
Oh, my gosh.

00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:31.439
May I help you?

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:33.483
-Kim Gang-hun.
-Ms. Jung.

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:34.484
Why are you here?

00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:38.780
What's going on?

00:28:38.863 --> 00:28:42.575
Do you want to see me dead?
I've been looking everywhere for you!

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:44.786
Why can't you just stay put at home?

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:47.455
-Ma'am, we can sit and talk calmly--
-Move!

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:48.790
Hey…

00:28:49.874 --> 00:28:50.708
Let go!

00:28:51.709 --> 00:28:53.503
Let go of me!

00:28:53.586 --> 00:28:55.713
I'll call the police for child abuse.

00:28:55.797 --> 00:28:58.424
Let go!

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:00.468
Don't.

00:29:02.136 --> 00:29:04.472
I have nowhere else to go anyway.

00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:09.060
Don't do it. It's pointless.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:22.073
She isn't like that all the time.

00:29:23.074 --> 00:29:26.244
She takes antidepressants,
but I guess she can't control it well.

00:29:26.828 --> 00:29:29.956
-Yes, ma'am. I just found my son…
-She's like that sometimes.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:33.084
I think your mom
should seek professional help--

00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:36.254
I don't want to be put into care. No way.

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:40.717
-Gang-hun, your mom--
-My mom told me.

00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:45.054
She was abandoned by her parents
when she was nine.

00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:47.849
After running away from the orphanage
because she hated it,

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:51.936
she lived in a place
where runaway kids stayed together.

00:29:53.813 --> 00:29:56.232
But then, she got pregnant with me
when she was 16.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:59.736
Gang-hun.

00:30:02.113 --> 00:30:05.783
If God does exist,
I really want to ask Him.

00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:09.662
What on earth was He thinking?

00:30:13.499 --> 00:30:14.542
Why did He…

00:30:18.004 --> 00:30:19.631
To someone like me…

00:30:22.383 --> 00:30:23.217
Gang-hun.

00:30:26.721 --> 00:30:28.222
I guess you have to go now.

00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:36.356
Get home safely, ma'am.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.415
MIN'S STREET BAR

00:30:57.877 --> 00:30:59.462
Did you say we should take on the case?

00:31:00.088 --> 00:31:02.840
-Yes.
-You actually think there's a case here?

00:31:02.924 --> 00:31:04.968
Even if we might not win,

00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:07.011
some might take interest in this.

00:31:07.095 --> 00:31:10.181
Is a trial a live charity show
to help the needy?

00:31:10.264 --> 00:31:12.475
It could be a meaningful case.

00:31:12.558 --> 00:31:15.853
It can raise the issue
that the marginalized and disabled--

00:31:15.937 --> 00:31:17.230
Gosh, you sound entitled.

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:18.982
-Mr. Kang.
-What?

00:31:19.065 --> 00:31:21.067
Did I say something uncomfortable again?

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.610
If so, then instead…

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:26.948
Let's ask Mr. Jang.

00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:28.282
Mr. Jang, what do you think?

00:31:31.285 --> 00:31:34.372
Stop picking out
and eating just the mushrooms!

00:31:34.914 --> 00:31:37.375
Well, it won't be easy.

00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:39.502
It's not an easy task

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:42.005
to stand before the court.

00:31:42.088 --> 00:31:44.632
Gang-hun could get hurt too.

00:31:45.591 --> 00:31:48.219
I also think it won't be easy.

00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:50.304
It's obvious the case would be dismissed.

00:31:50.388 --> 00:31:52.807
First of all, if the defendant is God,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.352
I don't know what His mailing address is.

00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:57.770
-Geez.
-What?

00:31:57.854 --> 00:32:01.691
I'll make it so it'll make sense legally,
no matter what.

00:32:01.774 --> 00:32:02.608
And then--

00:32:02.692 --> 00:32:06.738
Do you know how painful false hope is?

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:10.783
Geez.

00:32:12.994 --> 00:32:14.579
-I'm a stupid boomer.
-Oh, my gosh.

00:32:14.662 --> 00:32:16.080
So I'll say one more thing.

00:32:16.164 --> 00:32:19.542
What Ms. Park is saying right now
are the typical thoughts of a person

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:22.128
who was raised delicately,
like a flower in a greenhouse.

00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.963
-Mr. Kang.
-You said you grew up comfortably

00:32:24.047 --> 00:32:25.423
and was raised by a loving family.

00:32:25.506 --> 00:32:29.552
People like that
don't know what real struggle is.

00:32:30.178 --> 00:32:32.263
Raise a societal issue?

00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:34.223
It could be meaningful
even though we'd lose?

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:37.268
What kind of help would that give the kid?

00:32:37.351 --> 00:32:39.395
But a pro bono case is--

00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:44.067
You came to this firm to make money too.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.071
After entering the top law firm in Korea
with good grades,

00:32:48.154 --> 00:32:52.450
I don't know and don't want to know
what could've possibly changed your mind.

00:32:53.743 --> 00:32:56.704
But let's not say things
that are totally unrealistic.

00:32:58.831 --> 00:33:00.249
You want to do something good?

00:33:01.459 --> 00:33:05.338
Just donate to charity instead.
You can pay for this too.

00:33:07.673 --> 00:33:08.674
For crying out loud.

00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:11.177
Mr. Kang…

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.362
It could be meaningful
even though we'd lose?

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:32.240
What kind of help would that give the kid?

00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:34.450
Maybe he's right.

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:38.996
There is a risk of social criticism,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.791
so a legal countermeasure
should also be carried out.

00:33:41.874 --> 00:33:43.000
Thank you.

00:33:43.084 --> 00:33:45.753
Gosh. You're indeed excellent, Gi-ppeum.

00:33:45.837 --> 00:33:48.840
You compared the pros and cons
of each plan very well.

00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:50.341
Thank you.

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:53.136
Okay, everyone. We'll go with Plan C then.

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:54.679
-Yes, sir.
-What? Sir.

00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:58.808
Plan C, as I mentioned in the report--

00:33:58.891 --> 00:34:01.435
Through a loophole
in the Labor Standards Act,

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:04.814
it'd be a way for companies
to lay off a massive number of employees.

00:34:04.897 --> 00:34:05.773
Yeah, that was good.

00:34:05.857 --> 00:34:08.067
Yes, so instead of Plan C,
Plan A should be…

00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:11.195
It's a legal circumvention,
so it's not illegal.

00:34:11.279 --> 00:34:14.949
It reduces legal risks
and a large amount of labor cost.

00:34:15.032 --> 00:34:17.743
-There's no reason not to go with it.
-Yes.

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:19.203
Well…

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:21.414
Still…

00:34:21.497 --> 00:34:22.331
Ms. Park.

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:26.419
Don't you have enough experience
to not be that naive anymore?

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.047
Stop thinking about useless things
and focus on the numbers.

00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:32.425
Revenue, costs, profits.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.094
Right, everyone?

00:34:35.178 --> 00:34:36.220
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.517
Hello.

00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:44.478
LAUNCHING TEAM PRO BONO

00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.692
OUR PLEDGE TO PUBLIC INTEREST STARTS NOW

00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:52.570
IN-HOUSE TEAM FOR PUBLIC INTEREST CASES

00:34:57.158 --> 00:34:59.410
Listen, Gi-ppeum.

00:35:00.036 --> 00:35:02.163
Do you know how hard it is
to get into our team?

00:35:02.246 --> 00:35:05.708
But you want to leave our team
and join the pro bono team?

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:09.545
-It's because I like that work.
-Come on. Stop it.

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.214
Will you tell me the real reason?

00:35:11.297 --> 00:35:13.925
Do you want to be a politician?
Is it to build a political career?

00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:15.426
No.

00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:18.596
It's what I really want to do, sir.

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:20.806
Or is it this?
"I want to change the world!"

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.016
Something like that?

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:24.518
I don't know anything
about such grand ideas.

00:35:25.144 --> 00:35:27.563
I just want to deal with people
rather than numbers.

00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:30.441
I want to do work
that helps people in need.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.197
I had no idea
you were such a noble person.

00:35:37.782 --> 00:35:38.950
Okay. I get it.

00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:40.868
Let's be honest.

00:35:40.952 --> 00:35:43.037
What's the real reason?

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.750
Is it that weird

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:51.379
for wanting to live life
by doing good things

00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:52.838
without any other motives?

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:56.133
Why does everyone not believe me?

00:35:57.635 --> 00:35:59.470
Why do we have to prove good will

00:35:59.553 --> 00:36:01.806
and assume selfishness?

00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:21.617
All right, Gi-ppeum.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.744
Don't be intimidated.

00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:27.039
Go home and eat something tasty.

00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:29.667
Let's do it.

00:36:33.462 --> 00:36:34.380
Let's go.

00:36:41.387 --> 00:36:43.055
Hello, everyone.

00:36:44.807 --> 00:36:45.641
Hello.

00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:47.143
Hello, Mr. Jang.

00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:52.898
Are these also mushrooms?

00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:55.026
They're so pretty.

00:36:58.029 --> 00:37:02.658
Did you put them here, Mr. Jang?

00:37:03.326 --> 00:37:05.619
They're called
the half-dyed slender Caesar.

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:07.621
They grow in greenhouses.

00:37:08.247 --> 00:37:12.126
But they grow well outside too.
Strong and well.

00:37:15.463 --> 00:37:16.922
Mr. Jang.

00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.175
You can do it.

00:37:20.926 --> 00:37:21.802
I can do it.

00:37:22.845 --> 00:37:24.805
I have to go to the archive room.

00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:26.557
Geez.

00:37:28.642 --> 00:37:30.436
-Geez, these keep falling--
-Here.

00:37:31.854 --> 00:37:33.022
Thank you.

00:37:55.753 --> 00:37:57.463
"The standard…" Hold on.

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:02.134
Violation of the doctor's obligation
to explain…

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:10.768
"Those who receive surgery
for varicose vein malformations…"

00:38:15.106 --> 00:38:17.191
-Welcome.
-Hello.

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:21.195
Is Jung So-min here?

00:38:21.278 --> 00:38:23.072
-Go on. Later…
-Wait.

00:38:24.532 --> 00:38:27.326
Please tell me a little more.

00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:29.328
Isn't this wrong?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.341
If that's true, So-min,
we do have a chance.

00:38:50.307 --> 00:38:51.142
ABORTION ANALYSIS

00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.150
WHY GIVE BIRTH?

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.067
Why?

00:39:01.026 --> 00:39:03.195
We've already talked about it last time.

00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:05.448
Are you going to deliver
the complaint to God?

00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:06.699
What's His address?

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:09.577
It's 101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.744
He lives in Gangnam?

00:39:11.454 --> 00:39:12.830
What's godlike to pregnant women?

00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:16.917
-What?
-101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:19.712
Woongsan General Hospital,
a subsidiary of Woongsan Group.

00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:25.551
That's where I'm sending
the complaint for damages.

00:39:34.643 --> 00:39:36.770
CAPERNAUM

00:39:36.854 --> 00:39:38.814
DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:40.900
Gang-hun.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.659
You're home early. Didn't you go to work?

00:39:50.743 --> 00:39:51.994
Yeah.

00:39:52.077 --> 00:39:53.746
I'm sick.

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:55.831
I have a headache too.

00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:57.875
Maybe it's a cold.
I have a sore throat too.

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:02.588
You promised you wouldn't drink.

00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:06.383
I drank because I was sick!

00:40:07.384 --> 00:40:08.511
Fine.

00:40:50.928 --> 00:40:52.846
Why is it so hard to live?

00:40:54.765 --> 00:40:56.350
I'm probably getting punished

00:40:57.059 --> 00:40:58.394
for living so recklessly

00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:01.480
and thoughtlessly.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.277
Am I your punishment then?

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:14.952
-What?
-But what am I getting punished for?

00:41:26.046 --> 00:41:28.424
Jung So-min became pregnant with Gang-hun

00:41:28.507 --> 00:41:30.342
when she was living
with other runaway kids.

00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:32.636
The Woongsan Welfare Foundation

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.015
introduced her to Woongsan General
Hospital, so she was treated there.

00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:39.268
Actually, So-min never wanted
to give birth in the first place.

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:43.731
It was an unwanted pregnancy.
And she was too young to deal with it.

00:41:44.523 --> 00:41:48.569
But the hospital ignored
So-min's opinion multiple times,

00:41:48.652 --> 00:41:50.446
and kept persuading her to give birth.

00:41:50.529 --> 00:41:51.822
What? Why did they do that?

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:53.699
Exactly. And on top of that,

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:56.702
the hospital couldn't have been
any more careless.

00:41:56.785 --> 00:41:58.412
They knew very well
the expectant mother

00:41:58.495 --> 00:42:01.832
was drinking soju and eating junk food
instead of real meals every day.

00:42:01.915 --> 00:42:04.752
But they didn't carry out
a single proper exam.

00:42:04.835 --> 00:42:06.795
I heard it was a chaebol hospital.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:08.255
Were they too busy treating VIPs?

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:09.757
Gang-hun's lower limb paralysis

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.718
was caused by a malformation
from an underdeveloped brain

00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:13.844
during the fetal stage.

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:18.682
It's not certain,
but her alcohol addiction and malnutrition

00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:20.517
might have affected this.

00:42:21.018 --> 00:42:24.647
If she had received
a timely, proper ultrasound,

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:27.191
it would've shown
the brain malformation of the fetus.

00:42:28.525 --> 00:42:30.277
-Isn't that right, Mr. Kang?
-What?

00:42:31.111 --> 00:42:32.821
Mr. Kang, did you already…

00:42:33.322 --> 00:42:36.700
The one who took the lower limb paralysis
lawsuit files from the archive room

00:42:37.409 --> 00:42:39.495
was you, wasn't it?

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:43.123
Yes. You're right.

00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:46.293
But I haven't made
as much progress as you have.

00:42:46.377 --> 00:42:47.836
You're amazing, Ms. Park.

00:42:49.588 --> 00:42:51.548
I did enter the top law firm
with good grades.

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:56.720
If it's Woongsan General Hospital,

00:42:56.804 --> 00:42:58.722
I know someone from their labor union.

00:42:58.806 --> 00:43:01.517
-I'll look into their internal affairs.
-Good luck.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.853
If it's Woongsan Group,
it'll be against Woo Myeong-hun again.

00:43:05.437 --> 00:43:07.272
What? Why?

00:43:07.356 --> 00:43:08.691
He's the legal advisor there

00:43:08.774 --> 00:43:10.984
and to most other chaebols too.

00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:14.822
He's such a skilled attorney.

00:43:14.905 --> 00:43:17.324
I wish I could learn from him…

00:43:18.409 --> 00:43:19.576
…wasn't what I meant.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.911
That's not what I meant.

00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:22.413
-I…
-What did you mean?

00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:27.000
Your eyes are so scary right now.

00:43:27.543 --> 00:43:29.336
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT, BUCHEON BRANCH

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.092
All rise.

00:43:43.684 --> 00:43:44.685
Please be seated.

00:43:48.355 --> 00:43:49.648
Your Honor,

00:43:50.399 --> 00:43:52.943
I'm sorry, but before we begin the trial--

00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:55.362
Is it about the motion
to reassign to another judge?

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:57.114
It's just as you had expected.

00:43:58.031 --> 00:43:58.991
Yeah.

00:43:59.074 --> 00:44:01.326
Gang-hun's case was assigned
to Civil Division 7.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.494
Is that a good thing?

00:44:02.578 --> 00:44:03.412
A FEW DAYS AGO

00:44:03.495 --> 00:44:06.123
Yes. It's Judge Kim Jin-o.
She has a severe visual impairment.

00:44:06.206 --> 00:44:09.418
Really? Goodness, she's amazing.

00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:11.795
I don't know
if that's necessarily a good thing?

00:44:11.879 --> 00:44:14.131
What? Isn't it a good thing?

00:44:14.214 --> 00:44:17.718
She must understand the lives of people
with disabilities better than anyone.

00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.137
She'd relate to them, wouldn't she?

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.056
Don't you think so, Mr. Kang?
You know her well, don't you?

00:44:23.724 --> 00:44:24.558
No.

00:44:25.267 --> 00:44:27.770
I only know she's a judge
with a visual impairment.

00:44:27.853 --> 00:44:30.063
I can't believe there's a judge
even you don't know.

00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:33.650
As expected, he only knows
the popular judges.

00:44:34.234 --> 00:44:36.737
Gosh, this chair feels
especially uncomfortable.

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:42.326
By the way, the defense might try
for a motion to reassign the judge.

00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:43.494
Yes, Your Honor.

00:44:43.577 --> 00:44:45.496
I'm sorry,

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:47.831
but as this is a medical case,

00:44:48.373 --> 00:44:52.377
the amount of books and evidence
to refer to might be massive and--

00:44:52.461 --> 00:44:54.838
Are you worried how a judge
with a visual impairment

00:44:54.922 --> 00:44:56.215
will be able to read them?

00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:59.301
Well, no. I didn't particularly mean that.

00:44:59.384 --> 00:45:03.597
I probably read Braille texts
faster than you can read.

00:45:04.848 --> 00:45:06.975
As for the other texts…

00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:10.896
Complaint. Plaintiff, Kim Gang-hun.

00:45:10.979 --> 00:45:13.190
-Defendant…
-The screen reader reads for me,

00:45:13.273 --> 00:45:14.399
and I listen.

00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:17.819
A trial is all about listening, isn't it?

00:45:18.654 --> 00:45:20.739
I'll stay up all night to listen
if I have to,

00:45:20.822 --> 00:45:23.033
so you can submit any document you'd like.

00:45:24.743 --> 00:45:26.411
How could I possibly dare to question

00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:29.665
your ability to do your work, Your Honor?

00:45:29.748 --> 00:45:31.792
-It's just--
-Just?

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:34.461
Due to the nature of the case,

00:45:34.545 --> 00:45:37.130
if this Court proceeds with it,

00:45:37.214 --> 00:45:40.676
I worry it might cause
unnecessary misunderstandings.

00:45:40.759 --> 00:45:43.011
-Counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:45.138
I'm not a judge with disability.
I'm just a judge.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:50.394
This trial will proceed
like any other trial.

00:45:51.103 --> 00:45:52.813
The motion for reassignment is dismissed.

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:56.066
But that won't necessarily
be beneficial for us.

00:45:57.943 --> 00:45:58.944
Really?

00:45:59.027 --> 00:46:00.946
When you go through immigration overseas,

00:46:01.029 --> 00:46:02.656
-where do you line up?
-Well…

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:07.327
I go to a young female examiner
who looks kind.

00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:10.080
Wrong. That will most likely
take the longest time.

00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:11.832
And why is that?

00:46:11.915 --> 00:46:14.042
The more of a minority you are in a group,

00:46:14.126 --> 00:46:16.378
the more you tend
to strictly adhere to principles

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.131
-to avoid being misunderstood.
-I see.

00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:22.593
Why would they be misunderstood?

00:46:22.676 --> 00:46:27.389
This lawsuit is based
on groundless speculation.

00:46:27.472 --> 00:46:30.642
The plaintiff is only making
vague allegations.

00:46:30.726 --> 00:46:33.103
And they have failed
to present objective evidence.

00:46:33.186 --> 00:46:35.981
The defendant's hospital
is the best in Korea.

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:39.318
They have no reason not to conduct
necessary tests on pregnant patients--

00:46:39.401 --> 00:46:41.278
To prove exactly this point,

00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:46.116
we requested an order to present
all of the medical reports from that time,

00:46:46.992 --> 00:46:49.119
but the defendant has not responded.

00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:51.246
It's been over than ten years.

00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:56.126
As they were past the storage term,
they had been already disposed of.

00:46:56.209 --> 00:46:57.502
Doesn't the defendant's hospital

00:46:57.586 --> 00:47:02.090
unofficially keep records
past the storage term

00:47:02.174 --> 00:47:03.550
for research purposes?

00:47:04.593 --> 00:47:05.427
I don't know.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.514
I don't know where you heard that,
but that's not something we know of.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.975
-Your Honor!
-Yes.

00:47:12.976 --> 00:47:15.854
They do seem to be past
the legal storage term.

00:47:15.937 --> 00:47:19.149
As you don't have objective evidence
that such documents exist currently,

00:47:19.232 --> 00:47:20.317
prove it by other means.

00:47:27.074 --> 00:47:27.908
Honestly,

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.870
the defendant's hospital
is very disconcerted.

00:47:31.953 --> 00:47:35.374
The plaintiff's mother,
who had nowhere to go,

00:47:35.457 --> 00:47:37.542
was able to give birth
at the defendant's hospital,

00:47:37.626 --> 00:47:39.628
Korea's best hospital,

00:47:40.253 --> 00:47:42.130
all thanks to the goodwill

00:47:42.214 --> 00:47:45.342
of Woongsan Welfare Foundation,
which desired to help runaway teenagers.

00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:46.259
But…

00:47:47.177 --> 00:47:49.971
Ungratefulness is the only word
that comes to mind--

00:47:50.055 --> 00:47:52.891
Counsel, that is irrelevant to the trial.
Please stop.

00:47:54.351 --> 00:47:55.727
Yes, Your Honor.

00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:56.645
However,

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.816
we request
an early dismissal of this trial.

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:03.860
There doesn't seem to be much
the plaintiff's counsel can do.

00:48:03.944 --> 00:48:05.112
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:48:06.988 --> 00:48:07.989
Your Honor,

00:48:08.782 --> 00:48:12.661
we will ask the Health Insurance Committee
for a fact inquiry.

00:48:13.578 --> 00:48:14.996
About what?

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.250
The number of abortions
Woongsan General Hospital

00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:20.544
has performed in the last ten years.

00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:23.255
And the number of abortions
performed at other big hospitals

00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:24.423
similar to Woongsan.

00:48:25.298 --> 00:48:26.299
What is the purpose?

00:48:26.383 --> 00:48:27.884
For purposes that are unknown,

00:48:27.968 --> 00:48:33.640
the defendant's hospital has deliberately
avoided performing abortions

00:48:34.182 --> 00:48:36.226
and has urged patients to give birth.

00:48:38.061 --> 00:48:39.271
Mr. Kang.

00:48:41.106 --> 00:48:42.065
Mr. Kang.

00:48:48.405 --> 00:48:49.322
Mr. Kang!

00:48:49.906 --> 00:48:51.116
What was all that about?

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:52.743
Did you find some evidence?

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:54.286
No, I have no such thing.

00:48:54.369 --> 00:48:56.621
Why would you drop a bomb like that
without evidence?

00:48:56.705 --> 00:48:58.999
You remember what Myeong-hun said earlier?

00:48:59.082 --> 00:49:01.376
"Being ungrateful" or whatever?

00:49:02.669 --> 00:49:05.589
What? Right. Woongsan Welfare Foundation

00:49:05.672 --> 00:49:08.967
let her get treated at Woongsan General
Hospital to help runaway teenagers.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.261
It came to mind
while listening to that.

00:49:11.344 --> 00:49:15.015
Actually, So-min never wanted
to give birth in the first place.

00:49:15.098 --> 00:49:19.102
It was an unwanted pregnancy.
And she was too young to deal with it.

00:49:19.186 --> 00:49:23.064
But the hospital ignored
So-min's opinion multiple times,

00:49:23.148 --> 00:49:25.317
and kept persuading her to give birth.

00:49:25.901 --> 00:49:29.613
Why would they send
pregnant runaway teenagers

00:49:29.696 --> 00:49:31.907
to Woongsan General Hospital?

00:49:32.574 --> 00:49:34.367
They weren't even going to
look after them.

00:49:35.869 --> 00:49:38.079
This might be a ridiculous thought,

00:49:39.331 --> 00:49:43.084
but what if there was
some kind of intent behind all of this?

00:49:50.091 --> 00:49:52.803
The group with the highest ratio
of abortions is…

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:56.389
It's probably runaway teenagers.

00:49:58.308 --> 00:49:59.601
Like So-min.

00:50:12.155 --> 00:50:15.200
I heard back from members of Woongsan
General Hospital's labor union.

00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:18.411
Unless the lives of the mothers
were in imminent danger,

00:50:19.037 --> 00:50:22.123
they didn't terminate pregnancies.

00:50:23.166 --> 00:50:26.211
They said the younger doctors
complained a lot about it.

00:50:27.045 --> 00:50:30.799
They were nervous because the risk
of missing the right time was so high.

00:50:31.466 --> 00:50:34.469
They probably didn't tell the mothers
about their fetuses' conditions.

00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.976
The Health Insurance Committee replied
to our fact inquiry.

00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:42.102
What did they say?

00:50:44.479 --> 00:50:47.816
They've refused to answer as it concerns
trade secrets of the hospitals.

00:50:50.777 --> 00:50:53.029
I can't believe those punks.

00:50:53.113 --> 00:50:54.322
HIC CHAIR
PARK CHEOL-MIN

00:50:57.367 --> 00:50:58.702
They made this perfectly for me.

00:51:00.704 --> 00:51:03.331
-Yes?
-Call Attorney Woo's office.

00:51:03.415 --> 00:51:06.167
Tell him I got his gift
and I appreciate it.

00:51:06.251 --> 00:51:08.003
Chairman Park, that fool.

00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:10.547
When Myeong-hun worked
at the Blue House Civil Affairs Office,

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.549
he got Park that job.

00:51:13.675 --> 00:51:16.887
Okay. So this is how you're going to play?

00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:18.638
What do we do then?

00:51:18.722 --> 00:51:20.974
We'll have to use a method

00:51:21.057 --> 00:51:23.351
that Korean civil servants
are scared of the most.

00:51:23.435 --> 00:51:24.769
What's that?

00:51:25.478 --> 00:51:26.730
Chairman Park.

00:51:26.813 --> 00:51:29.149
I told you not to wake me
when I'm in my massage chair.

00:51:29.232 --> 00:51:31.276
Chairman Park!

00:51:31.776 --> 00:51:34.029
-What?
-I'm sorry.

00:51:34.112 --> 00:51:37.365
I told him to wait outside,
but he suddenly barged in.

00:51:37.949 --> 00:51:39.826
What on earth? Who are you?

00:51:40.577 --> 00:51:42.120
You're up.

00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:44.789
Nice to meet you.

00:51:44.873 --> 00:51:46.207
I'm Attorney Kang Da-wit.

00:51:46.291 --> 00:51:48.877
Da-wit? Are you from Israel?

00:51:51.588 --> 00:51:52.797
By the way, Chairman Park,

00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:54.799
this is a nice putter.

00:51:54.883 --> 00:51:55.717
Is this gold?

00:51:56.217 --> 00:51:57.385
Don't hit the floor with it!

00:51:58.637 --> 00:51:59.638
I'm sorry.

00:52:02.223 --> 00:52:04.476
Right. You're the one
who requested the fact inquiry.

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:06.561
If you're here to throw a tantrum,
get out at once.

00:52:06.645 --> 00:52:08.104
We've already given our answer.

00:52:08.188 --> 00:52:11.399
Throw a tantrum?
Gosh, I'm too old for that.

00:52:11.483 --> 00:52:14.444
I'm not a whiny kid. Goodness!

00:52:14.527 --> 00:52:15.820
It fell.

00:52:15.904 --> 00:52:17.697
It's a complaint we're going to file

00:52:18.573 --> 00:52:19.866
against you.

00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:21.326
What?

00:52:25.622 --> 00:52:27.290
Request for information disclosure?

00:52:27.374 --> 00:52:28.708
It's not too big of a deal.

00:52:28.792 --> 00:52:30.710
It's about your official expenses

00:52:30.794 --> 00:52:32.379
and company card statements.

00:52:32.462 --> 00:52:37.050
Goodness, you've used your company card
for whenever your wife perms her hair.

00:52:38.093 --> 00:52:39.886
That's great. You're a family man.

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:41.930
This is what I need to learn. So sweet.

00:52:42.013 --> 00:52:43.014
-Mr. Kang?
-Yes?

00:52:43.098 --> 00:52:46.935
All successful negotiations on earth
have occurred while sitting calmly.

00:52:47.018 --> 00:52:48.228
Please, let's sit.

00:52:48.311 --> 00:52:49.688
-Please.
-Okay.

00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:51.022
I'll sit and talk.

00:52:51.898 --> 00:52:57.112
Okay. This is the list of furniture
and equipment purchases for your office.

00:52:57.195 --> 00:52:59.406
You know the one there
you were just sleeping in?

00:52:59.489 --> 00:53:00.949
That's a limited edition one.

00:53:01.032 --> 00:53:03.326
Where did you get that?

00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:09.290
I bought it with my own money
during an overseas business trip.

00:53:09.374 --> 00:53:10.625
Overseas business trip?

00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:13.211
The overseas business trip expenses…

00:53:13.294 --> 00:53:17.924
Where did you go to research
the cutting-edge medical industry?

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:20.010
That's right.

00:53:20.885 --> 00:53:22.929
"Let's drink a Maldives in mojito."

00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:28.309
Of course, you have to go to the Maldives
for cutting-edge medicine!

00:53:28.393 --> 00:53:32.272
Wait. But you didn't go with your wife.

00:53:32.355 --> 00:53:33.773
Mr. Kang!

00:53:33.857 --> 00:53:36.526
Goodness, Mr. Park.

00:53:36.609 --> 00:53:38.778
Mr. Kang. Sir. Doctor.

00:53:38.862 --> 00:53:39.988
I'll call you anything.

00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:42.073
I'll call you my big brother.

00:53:42.157 --> 00:53:44.659
Lord Da-wit. Let's calmly talk about this.

00:53:44.743 --> 00:53:48.121
-Let's talk it out.
-Then, shall we talk about it over tea?

00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:49.581
Yes, sir.

00:53:49.664 --> 00:53:50.665
RESPONSE TO FACT INQUIRY

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:53.752
The response to the fact inquiry
has suddenly come in.

00:53:55.378 --> 00:53:58.131
Last time, they clearly said
they couldn't respond.

00:53:58.214 --> 00:54:00.300
Well, I…

00:54:01.468 --> 00:54:04.345
I don't know what happened either,

00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:07.098
but in any case,
it doesn't seem to directly relate

00:54:07.182 --> 00:54:09.100
to the dispute of the case--

00:54:09.184 --> 00:54:10.518
It's 91%!

00:54:12.395 --> 00:54:13.605
WOONGSAN'S ABORTION RATE

00:54:15.315 --> 00:54:16.983
According to their response,

00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:22.280
Woongsan General Hospital's abortion rate

00:54:22.363 --> 00:54:27.368
is 91% less than the average rate
of other hospitals.

00:54:27.994 --> 00:54:32.874
Mr. Woo. Is this a coincidence?
Or a miracle?

00:54:32.957 --> 00:54:35.543
Wait. What does that prove though?

00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:38.588
The numbers are only numbers.

00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:41.841
Each mother's situation and views
are bound to be unique--

00:54:41.925 --> 00:54:44.803
That is why we will submit additional data

00:54:44.886 --> 00:54:47.764
that is very interesting.

00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:52.811
EVIDENCE SUBMISSION FORM

00:54:53.394 --> 00:54:54.354
Your Honor.

00:54:55.688 --> 00:55:00.151
Do you know who the biggest sponsor
of pro-life groups in Korea is?

00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:03.029
Your Honor, the plaintiff's counsel
is delaying the trial

00:55:03.113 --> 00:55:04.322
with an irrelevant claim.

00:55:04.405 --> 00:55:07.117
It's very relevant, Mr. Woo.

00:55:08.284 --> 00:55:12.122
Five years' worth of audits
for these groups

00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:17.836
were found by a certain bold
and persistent nerd from our firm…

00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:20.713
Geez!

00:55:23.007 --> 00:55:24.342
Ms. Park?

00:55:29.264 --> 00:55:33.101
What's that? Were you here all weekend?
Why didn't you go home?

00:55:33.184 --> 00:55:35.436
-Just take a look at this.
-What is it?

00:55:41.693 --> 00:55:44.028
How did you find all of this?

00:55:44.112 --> 00:55:47.740
What do you mean "How?"
I just went headlong and found it all.

00:55:48.658 --> 00:55:51.870
According to the detailed analysis
by this attorney,

00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:54.205
their biggest sponsor

00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:58.001
is the Elliot Foundation in Hong Kong.

00:55:59.043 --> 00:56:01.421
It's a completely
unknown organization in Korea.

00:56:02.547 --> 00:56:05.341
So what about it?

00:56:05.425 --> 00:56:08.303
Elliot Foundation's address
is in Hong Kong.

00:56:08.386 --> 00:56:12.307
But they do have
a postal address in Korea.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.641
Its address?

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:22.483
It's 101 Dogok-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

00:56:26.821 --> 00:56:27.739
Just a moment.

00:56:29.115 --> 00:56:31.326
-That's--
-Yes, Your Honor. That's right.

00:56:31.409 --> 00:56:34.037
It's the address of the defendant's
Woongsan General Hospital

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.914
and Woongsan Welfare Foundation,

00:56:35.997 --> 00:56:38.458
which are located in the same building.

00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:42.962
And Elliot was the name
used in the US by Choi U-jin,

00:56:43.046 --> 00:56:45.298
CEO Choi Woong-san's only son

00:56:45.381 --> 00:56:48.051
who died at the age of 30.

00:56:50.345 --> 00:56:52.764
After the passing of his son,

00:56:52.847 --> 00:56:55.642
Mr. Choi suddenly
devoted himself to religion.

00:56:56.226 --> 00:57:00.188
Since then, Mr. Choi has even become
the biggest sponsor and an elder

00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:03.233
of Korea's most fundamental
religious body.

00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:09.030
That's speculation. Even if Mr. Choi
did have strong religious beliefs,

00:57:09.113 --> 00:57:12.242
there is absolutely no evidence
that he specifically ordered

00:57:12.325 --> 00:57:14.661
-the medical staff to--
-That is what power is!

00:57:14.744 --> 00:57:17.872
Even without direct orders,
due to the nature of an organization,

00:57:17.956 --> 00:57:20.541
they can't help
but carry out the leader's will.

00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:23.336
Medical staff who didn't follow
the organization's unspoken rule

00:57:23.419 --> 00:57:26.881
were mistreated for various reasons
before being forced to leave.

00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:30.093
We will be submitting
the related evidence soon.

00:57:30.176 --> 00:57:32.095
Yes, I would appreciate that.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:34.847
Well, that's enough

00:57:35.682 --> 00:57:38.017
to be pretty relevant, don't you think?

00:57:39.143 --> 00:57:41.729
Please don't forget
to submit the related evidence.

00:57:41.813 --> 00:57:42.855
Yes, sir.

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:55.368
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:57:55.451 --> 00:57:57.579
You really are good at what you do.

00:57:59.038 --> 00:57:59.956
Hey, kid.

00:58:00.039 --> 00:58:01.624
You should be honored.

00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:03.126
Despite what you think of me--

00:58:03.209 --> 00:58:04.210
Thank you.

00:58:04.294 --> 00:58:05.795
And I'm sorry.

00:58:06.379 --> 00:58:08.673
You must've had a hard time
because of how I insisted.

00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:11.092
What's this all of a sudden?

00:58:11.175 --> 00:58:12.927
I'm not used to it. What's with you?

00:58:13.011 --> 00:58:16.431
I can't afford to pay,
so I should at least do this.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:18.182
I knew it.

00:58:18.266 --> 00:58:20.310
I knew something was up. Geez.

00:58:21.894 --> 00:58:25.189
But your mom never showed up.
Not even once.

00:58:25.273 --> 00:58:27.233
She barely approved
the power of attorney.

00:58:27.942 --> 00:58:30.778
She was furious about me
doing something meaningless.

00:58:31.404 --> 00:58:35.116
She said people like us can't win
against a giant hospital like that.

00:58:36.743 --> 00:58:39.037
But will we really be able to win?

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.542
In the end, we couldn't secure
the medical reports,

00:58:44.626 --> 00:58:46.711
so we've only proved half of our point.

00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:50.006
Is that so?

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.769
Am I your punishment then?

00:59:04.187 --> 00:59:08.733
-What?
-But what am I getting punished for?

00:59:14.947 --> 00:59:18.201
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT, BUCHEON BRANCH
DAY OF VERDICT

00:59:27.001 --> 00:59:30.380
Based on all the evidence
submitted to this Court,

00:59:31.005 --> 00:59:33.758
the Court believes
the plaintiff's disability

00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:36.219
should have been diagnosed
while they were in the womb.

00:59:36.302 --> 00:59:38.179
Thus, the defendant's hospital

00:59:38.262 --> 00:59:40.473
did not fulfill their duty

00:59:40.556 --> 00:59:43.184
of properly diagnosing
and explaining this condition.

00:59:44.477 --> 00:59:45.478
However,

00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:48.231
on the argument
that the defendant's hospital failed

00:59:48.314 --> 00:59:51.901
to properly inform the plaintiff's mother
of precautions to take during pregnancy

00:59:51.984 --> 00:59:55.405
or that such a failure
caused the plaintiff's disability,

00:59:55.488 --> 00:59:57.824
there is not enough evidence
to acknowledge this claim.

00:59:58.574 --> 01:00:01.494
Therefore, this Court does not accept
the claim of damages

01:00:01.577 --> 01:00:02.954
for causing disability.

01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:07.959
I knew it.

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:11.003
What remains is the allegation

01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:14.841
that the defendant's hospital failed,
whether by intent or negligence,

01:00:14.924 --> 01:00:16.884
to fulfill its duty
to diagnose and explain

01:00:16.968 --> 01:00:18.970
the possibility
of the plaintiff's disability.

01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:21.264
To put it plainly,

01:00:21.848 --> 01:00:24.434
it did not give the chance
to abort the plaintiff.

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:29.480
In order to accept
the liability for damages,

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:34.026
we have to answer one
of the most difficult questions.

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:38.072
For the plaintiff to win this case,
we would have to say,

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:41.492
"It would've been better for the world
if this 12-year-old boy Gang-hun

01:00:42.243 --> 01:00:44.495
hadn't been born at all."

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:48.791
"His life and existence itself
is damaging."

01:00:50.126 --> 01:00:52.795
That is the kind of terrible conclusion
we would have to reach.

01:00:56.966 --> 01:00:59.051
As an individual,

01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:02.972
I do understand the kind of emotions

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:06.184
the plaintiff must have come
to this court with.

01:01:08.102 --> 01:01:11.105
However, I am here not as an individual

01:01:11.773 --> 01:01:13.107
but as a judge.

01:01:14.442 --> 01:01:16.152
And according to
the Constitution of Korea,

01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:19.030
whether you have a disability or not,

01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:20.823
whether you are rich or poor,

01:01:21.699 --> 01:01:24.327
the lives of all humans
are equally sacred.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.788
That is its fundamental premise.

01:01:27.955 --> 01:01:28.956
Under the Constitution,

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:32.710
no right is more valuable than life.

01:01:33.836 --> 01:01:36.339
Thus, it is not possible
to make the hypothetical assessment

01:01:36.422 --> 01:01:38.966
that the absence of a life
is better than its existence.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.803
Which life has the value to exist?

01:01:42.845 --> 01:01:47.225
Which life would be better off
to have not existed?

01:01:48.684 --> 01:01:52.897
Such judgments lie
outside the realms of human ability.

01:01:55.066 --> 01:01:55.983
Therefore,

01:01:56.067 --> 01:01:59.862
as the Court does not acknowledge
the birth of Kim Gang-hun as damaging,

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:05.535
the plaintiff's claim is without grounds,
and the case is dismissed.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.918
The beautiful language

01:02:14.877 --> 01:02:16.295
that had made my heart race before

01:02:17.505 --> 01:02:21.008
felt like a giant wall this time.

01:02:35.106 --> 01:02:38.943
In the end, we couldn't break
the existing Supreme Court precedent.

01:02:39.527 --> 01:02:42.238
I submitted all
the related overseas precedents too.

01:02:42.822 --> 01:02:45.867
But that doesn't erase
how the fault lies with Woongsan.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:48.661
After making them give birth,
they stopped caring.

01:02:48.744 --> 01:02:51.831
-It's ridiculous!
-Why are you yelling at me?

01:02:54.792 --> 01:02:58.421
We can't do anything legally, can we?
The logic is airtight.

01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:01.424
I disagree.

01:03:01.966 --> 01:03:05.344
I think that's all
a beautiful load of crap.

01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:08.431
What are you all doing?

01:03:08.514 --> 01:03:12.226
You weren't just going to
give up like this, were you?

01:03:16.063 --> 01:03:19.609
If you don't get it, memorize it.

01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:22.778
"We will win no matter what."

01:03:22.862 --> 01:03:26.490
If we were bound to lose,
I wouldn't have even started!

01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:27.658
Do you get it?

01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:29.076
I believe, Mr. Kang!

01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:32.872
Geez. Just bow to him, why don't you?
Is he your cult leader or what?

01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:35.416
Then, shall we have some snacks
before our meeting

01:03:35.499 --> 01:03:36.876
on appeal strategies?

01:03:36.959 --> 01:03:39.295
We can't think well if we're hungry.

01:03:39.378 --> 01:03:40.880
-Please sit.
-Sounds good.

01:03:41.797 --> 01:03:43.299
No!

01:03:43.382 --> 01:03:46.385
We won't get enough energy
with just these measly snacks.

01:03:46.469 --> 01:03:47.845
Today,

01:03:47.929 --> 01:03:51.349
I'll treat you
to the most delicious bakery

01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:52.266
in the world.

01:03:53.225 --> 01:03:54.810
Let's go!

01:03:54.894 --> 01:03:56.395
-You said it's your treat!
-Okay!

01:03:56.479 --> 01:03:57.980
-Let's eat and cheer up!
-Let's go!

01:03:58.064 --> 01:03:59.440
Let's eat and cheer up, Gi-ppeum!

01:04:01.734 --> 01:04:03.778
It strangely feels like I lost.

01:04:09.116 --> 01:04:10.284
It's in French.

01:04:10.368 --> 01:04:12.745
"Joie de vivre." The joy of life.

01:04:12.828 --> 01:04:14.622
The joy, or Gi-ppeum, of life.

01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:17.500
Wait!

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:18.626
It's a blackout.

01:04:21.212 --> 01:04:22.880
Oh, my gosh! Is it your birthday?

01:04:22.964 --> 01:04:26.717
No. I just prepared something
as a way to cheer us up.

01:04:26.801 --> 01:04:28.427
There's so much fruit on top!

01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.513
-So much!
-Okay, everyone.

01:04:30.596 --> 01:04:33.140
When I say "Pro Bono,"
you'll say "Victory."

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:34.725
Then, we'll blow out the candle.

01:04:38.312 --> 01:04:40.356
"Victory" is so lame.

01:04:41.232 --> 01:04:42.358
Welcome.

01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:44.735
What? I've seen that man before.

01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:46.028
Okay.

01:04:46.112 --> 01:04:47.488
Where have I seen him?

01:04:48.698 --> 01:04:49.740
Right. The taxi.

01:04:49.824 --> 01:04:50.992
Let me introduce them.

01:04:51.075 --> 01:04:52.994
This is my mom and dad.

01:04:55.496 --> 01:04:56.956
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:04:57.915 --> 01:05:00.543
They are attorneys who work with me.

01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:02.586
In order, their names are…

01:05:03.129 --> 01:05:06.257
Jang Yeong-sil.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.300
-Hello.
-When you report to the local…

01:05:08.384 --> 01:05:11.429
-They issue an announcement…
-I want to tie those hands down.

01:05:11.512 --> 01:05:13.889
Can't she talk without moving her hands?

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.268
Kang Da-wit.

01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:18.185
Hello.

01:05:20.146 --> 01:05:22.064
Hwang Jun-u.

01:05:22.148 --> 01:05:22.982
Hello!

01:05:23.649 --> 01:05:25.568
Yoo Nan-hui.

01:05:25.651 --> 01:05:26.610
Hello.

01:05:29.363 --> 01:05:30.364
We hope you enjoy.

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:33.242
Thank you for the food.

01:05:33.325 --> 01:05:34.326
You know sign language?

01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:36.370
Just a little.

01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:40.166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:05:40.249 --> 01:05:41.292
Thank you for the food.

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:43.210
Take a seat, everyone. Please eat.

01:05:43.294 --> 01:05:44.795
You know sign language too?

01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:46.172
Just a little.

01:05:46.255 --> 01:05:47.506
Gi-ppeum!

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.051
Your family runs this amazing bakery?

01:05:50.134 --> 01:05:51.886
I'm jealous. That's a bread-lover's dream.

01:05:51.969 --> 01:05:53.054
Isn't it?

01:05:53.137 --> 01:05:56.140
I must have saved the world
in my past life.

01:05:56.223 --> 01:05:57.725
Right? Thank you for the food!

01:05:59.268 --> 01:06:00.227
It's so good.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.229
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

01:06:03.606 --> 01:06:04.523
So…

01:06:07.985 --> 01:06:10.321
You must have opened this pretty recently.

01:06:10.404 --> 01:06:11.655
As expected,

01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:12.990
you have a keen eye.

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:14.950
It's only been a month.

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:16.911
What about before?

01:06:17.536 --> 01:06:18.746
In the past,

01:06:19.371 --> 01:06:21.707
they ran a place that was a bit bigger.

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:24.168
But when I was in high school,

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:26.378
Dad was tricked by a bad friend

01:06:26.462 --> 01:06:28.547
and lost the entire bakery.

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:29.507
Oh, no.

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:32.468
Because he was the co-signer,
he had to take on bank debt.

01:06:33.135 --> 01:06:35.971
After baking with my mom,
my dad had to drive a taxi for ten years

01:06:36.055 --> 01:06:37.181
just to make ends meet.

01:06:37.264 --> 01:06:40.142
You said you grew up comfortably
and was raised by a loving family.

01:06:40.226 --> 01:06:43.687
People like that
don't know what real struggle is.

01:06:44.688 --> 01:06:46.565
But this competent daughter of theirs

01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:49.318
worked hard as an attorney
to pitch in what she earned

01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:52.279
and borrowed a little bit
of money to open this place.

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.409
You're amazing, Ms. Park.

01:06:57.493 --> 01:06:58.577
You're making me shy.

01:06:59.286 --> 01:07:00.538
It's true though.

01:07:01.205 --> 01:07:02.206
She's awesome.

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:07.086
You like apricots, Gi-ppeum?
Aren't they sour?

01:07:07.169 --> 01:07:09.088
I like these over the sweet ones.

01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:10.798
They're sour and bitter.

01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:12.591
It's just like our lives.

01:07:13.259 --> 01:07:14.593
Okay. I'll try one.

01:07:16.095 --> 01:07:17.304
-Gosh.
-What?

01:07:17.388 --> 01:07:18.514
It's so sour!

01:07:21.725 --> 01:07:23.435
The coffee's good and not bitter.

01:07:25.104 --> 01:07:26.105
Please enjoy.

01:07:30.192 --> 01:07:31.652
INCHEON DISTRICT COURT
APPEAL HEARING

01:07:31.735 --> 01:07:34.446
Doesn't Judge Kook Yeong-jun
look a bit uptight?

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.283
Don't worry.
I'm sure Mr. Kang has it all planned out.

01:07:37.366 --> 01:07:39.285
-Plaintiff's counsel.
-Yes, Your Honor?

01:07:40.119 --> 01:07:40.995
Well,

01:07:41.495 --> 01:07:44.290
is there anything more to do
with an appeal?

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:46.959
In the first trial,

01:07:47.626 --> 01:07:50.254
you did everything you could.

01:07:50.337 --> 01:07:53.716
He rejected the wise ruling
of the first trial and appealed,

01:07:53.799 --> 01:07:56.010
so I'd like to ask
the plaintiff's counsel.

01:07:56.093 --> 01:07:58.429
What on earth did the defendant do wrong?

01:07:58.512 --> 01:08:01.307
Is it wrong to value life
more than anything else?

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.475
Do you actually think
it's better to not be born

01:08:03.559 --> 01:08:05.728
than to be born
as a person with a disability?

01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:06.979
Unless that's the case,

01:08:07.062 --> 01:08:09.190
the plaintiff's appeal
has no actual benefit.

01:08:09.273 --> 01:08:10.608
That is our standpoint.

01:08:13.402 --> 01:08:14.236
Your Honor.

01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:17.489
The defendant's Woongsan General Hospital

01:08:17.573 --> 01:08:19.533
followed Woongsan Group CEO
Choi Woong-san

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:23.996
and his sacred belief
that all lives are precious

01:08:24.079 --> 01:08:27.249
as they ignored the wishes
of a 16-year-old pregnant girl

01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:30.586
to have the plaintiff
Kim Gang-hun be born.

01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:31.712
At the first trial,

01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:35.549
with the sacred reason that all life
is precious and equal, they also ruled

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:38.594
that a life, no matter whose,
cannot be regarded as damaging

01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:41.305
and dismissed the plaintiff's claim.

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:47.311
That is amazing. I was touched too.

01:08:47.853 --> 01:08:49.647
Therefore, at this court of appeals,

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:54.652
we would like to examine one by one

01:08:54.735 --> 01:08:58.364
if Woongsan Group and Korea
really do treat

01:08:58.447 --> 01:09:01.533
every life respectfully and equally.

01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:03.202
Hold on.

01:09:03.285 --> 01:09:06.121
If you simply say
something is precious and equal,

01:09:06.205 --> 01:09:08.249
does that really make it
precious and equal?

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:11.168
I mean, is it okay for a judge to lie?

01:09:11.252 --> 01:09:13.212
Is it all right for a court to scam a kid?

01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:16.215
Plaintiff's counsel! What are you doing?

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.300
Is this trial a joke to you?

01:09:18.384 --> 01:09:22.346
No, Your Honor. I am simply asking
whether the Constitution of Korea,

01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:24.431
which states that all lives
are sacred and equal,

01:09:24.515 --> 01:09:26.267
is a scam or not.

01:09:27.017 --> 01:09:28.227
Just a moment.

01:09:28.769 --> 01:09:30.729
Why is he blowing things up?

01:09:30.813 --> 01:09:33.065
If Gang-hun, the boy sitting here,

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:37.236
has not been given dignified
and equal treatment in his life,

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:39.113
if the words "All lives are sacred"

01:09:39.196 --> 01:09:42.283
are revealed to be nothing
but a beautiful load of crap…

01:09:44.493 --> 01:09:48.747
then it'll have to be the one
who used his wrong beliefs

01:09:48.831 --> 01:09:53.168
to recklessly bring the plaintiff
into this world…

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:57.548
That crazy…

01:09:58.215 --> 01:09:59.216
Your Honor.

01:10:00.509 --> 01:10:04.763
I would like to sue Choi Woong-san,
the CEO of Woongsan Group,

01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:07.224
and have him stand trial.

01:10:13.439 --> 01:10:15.733
Your Honor, does this even make sense?

01:10:15.816 --> 01:10:17.109
With a ridiculous accusation…

01:10:17.192 --> 01:10:19.987
There he goes blowing things up again,
that attention-seeker.

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.448
-I really want to learn from him.
-Learn what?

01:10:31.915 --> 01:10:33.876
Sir, I have something urgent to report.

01:10:33.959 --> 01:10:34.793
CHOI WOONG-SAN

01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:36.295
The thing is…

01:10:40.716 --> 01:10:43.552
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

01:10:59.818 --> 01:11:02.821
-What on earth are you doing?
-Aren't on-site inspections done

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:05.407
so judges can form beliefs
from firsthand experience?

01:11:05.491 --> 01:11:06.784
That's what I did as a judge.

01:11:06.867 --> 01:11:10.579
Stop using Gang-hun as a PR stunt.
You're not fighting for yourself, are you?

01:11:10.662 --> 01:11:13.791
I'm going to make a winning team.
If you don't like that, you can leave.

01:11:13.874 --> 01:11:16.752
I'll file a separate lawsuit for damages

01:11:16.835 --> 01:11:19.129
against Chairman Choi Woong-san.

01:11:19.213 --> 01:11:21.924
Do you believe giving birth
to Gang-hun was damaging?

01:11:22.007 --> 01:11:25.260
If Gang-hun's life is damaging,
then who caused that damage?

01:11:25.344 --> 01:11:28.097
-Is it for the money?
-Do you have some kind of right

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.432
to be involved
in the lives and deaths of others?

01:11:30.516 --> 01:11:31.850
Please tell me.

01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:35.562
What do I need to do
so I can live like other kids?

01:11:35.646 --> 01:11:37.856
If anyone causes harm to Oh & Partners…

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.066
I won't keep them around.

01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:41.568
That goes for Team Pro Bono and you.

01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:46.615
The debtor, Mr. Park Chang-sun.

01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:50.244
The Court rules…

01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:52.204
Wingardium Leviosa.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.081
…that the debtor

01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:56.500
is exempt from liability.

01:11:56.583 --> 01:11:58.293
What? Mom!

01:11:58.794 --> 01:12:00.045
We won!

01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:02.297
They said our debt is gone now.

01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:03.632
-Really?
-Yes.

01:12:03.715 --> 01:12:07.136
There are no grounds
for denying the exemption from liability.

01:12:09.138 --> 01:12:13.392
The applicant's remaining obligations
as a joint guarantor

01:12:13.475 --> 01:12:16.645
are hereby fully extinguished.

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:19.690
The spell cast by the judge in that moment

01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:23.277
was more incredible than any other spell

01:12:23.902 --> 01:12:26.321
from Harry Potter.

01:12:26.405 --> 01:12:29.700
Next, case number 2015-686…

01:12:32.619 --> 01:12:34.997
I see. You're hard of hearing.

01:12:36.081 --> 01:12:37.499
Is this how you do it?

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.001
Congratulations.

01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:41.462
You won.

01:12:41.545 --> 01:12:42.546
Thank you.

01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:44.882
I guess it's right.

01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:53.223
