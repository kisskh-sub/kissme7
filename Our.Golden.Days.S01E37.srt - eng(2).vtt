00:00:01.094 --> 00:00:03.834
Ji Hyuk! Mom was in a car accident and rushed to the hospital.

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:05.964
She's unconscious. Just hurry.

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:07.234
Please.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:09.574
Please, no.

00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:12.504
(Emergency Room, Family Waiting Area)

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:17.444
Dad!

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:19.384
She has passed away.

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:23.114
She was already in cardiac arrest when she arrived in the ER.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.524
What do you mean she passed away?

00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:36.964
Doctor.

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:38.634
Doctor, but...

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:40.334
No...

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:42.534
Ji Hyuk.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:44.434
Ji Wan.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.844
Ji Hyuk, what is it? How's Mom?

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.844
Your mom? What about her?

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.684
I got a call saying Mom was in a car accident.

00:00:57.754 --> 00:00:58.954
Doctor.

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.154
Wait, wasn't it Jo Ok Rye who passed away?

00:01:04.654 --> 00:01:07.624
- Grandma? - They were in the same accident.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.964
Ms. Jo Ok Rye had a cardiac arrest in the ambulance,

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.064
so she was already deceased upon arrival.

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:17.074
Ms. Kim Da Jeong had a CT scan for a concussion,

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:18.774
and is currently waiting to be admitted to a room.

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:24.544
But why were they in an accident together...

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.744
- Mother. My mother. - Dad!

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:28.984
- Dad. - Dad!

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:30.914
So, my grandma is the one who passed away?

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:34.254
- Where's my mother? - Doctor!

00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:38.894
Is it true? Is my grandma really gone?

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:41.764
- Sir, you need to be quiet in here. - Ji Hyuk, your grandmother...

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:44.234
A staff member will be here shortly to assist the family.

00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:45.304
Where is my mother?

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:47.304
Please wait a moment, and we'll escort you to the morgue.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.304
- Go check on Mom. I'll handle Dad. - My mother...

00:01:51.374 --> 00:01:53.274
- Please follow me. - Mother...

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:54.344
- Just go. Hurry up. - Where is my mother?

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.644
- Dad. - Ji Hyuk, your grandma...

00:01:56.944 --> 00:01:58.614
- I asked where my mother is! - Dad.

00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:01.454
- Dad, please calm down. - My mother.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:02.584
- Mother! - Please...

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:04.214
Mother.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.364
- Mom. - Mom.

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:16.194
Your grandmother...

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.404
Is your grandmother really gone?

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:23.734
Yes.

00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:26.674
But I don't know. I still can't believe it, Mom.

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:28.974
Ma'am, how are you feeling now?

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.844
- Are you very dizzy? - A little.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.524
What's my mom's condition?

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:41.994
The CT scan showed no major issues,

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:45.824
but we'll keep her for a few days to monitor for concussion symptoms.

00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:48.364
We'll let you know when her room is ready.

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:50.094
She needs absolute rest.

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:53.534
So...

00:02:57.274 --> 00:02:59.404
Grandma really is gone, then?

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.014
But Mom, what happened? Why were you two in a cab together?

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:07.584
We went to the department store.

00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:12.354
Your grandmother came to my shop wanting to buy me some clothes.

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.894
I must have been out of my mind. Why did I even go with her?

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.304
Mom, don't cry.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.174
You need absolute rest. Please don't cry.

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.004
He's right, Mom.

00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:34.774
Don't cry. Just lie down. We can't lose you too.

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:35.944
Please, don't cry.

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:46.624
Dad. Why don't you sit down over here?

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:07.844
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:12.884
Hey, Su Bin.

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:14.714
Seong Jae.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.554
My grandmother passed away.

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:22.554
My grandma...

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.924
She's gone.

00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:32.804
What do you mean?

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:35.474
Gone?

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:41.274
Grandma insisted on taking Mom to the department store for clothes.

00:04:41.774 --> 00:04:43.574
And then, some car just came out of nowhere...

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:46.444
Mom's okay, but...

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:48.854
My grandma...

00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:51.184
She had a heart attack.

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:58.564
Su Bin, listen, Ji Hyuk is calling me right now.

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:01.634
Let me talk to him. I'll call you right back.

00:05:04.764 --> 00:05:05.804
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:05:06.534 --> 00:05:08.704
What is all this? Did Grandma really pass away?

00:05:10.774 --> 00:05:11.774
Yes, Seong Jae.

00:05:13.044 --> 00:05:14.304
I can't believe this is happening.

00:05:16.244 --> 00:05:17.714
Hey, how's your mom doing?

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:19.884
My mom's fine, but...

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.514
Grandma passed away from a heart attack.

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:26.924
Which hospital are you at?

00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:31.194
I'll let your work and friends know, so just have Ji Wan handle the rest.

00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:32.394
No, don't worry about it.

00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:36.094
Both my father and I...

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:39.164
have decided to keep the service small.

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:42.774
This must be really hard on your father.

00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:46.444
Make sure you take good care of him. I'm on my way, Ji Hyuk.

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:49.274
Oh, no.

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:51.984
Yes.

00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:54.184
Okay, I understand.

00:05:55.184 --> 00:05:57.114
Yes, I'll pass that along to Cheol Min as well.

00:05:58.724 --> 00:05:59.754
And...

00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:01.524
Ji Hyuk...

00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:04.724
He specifically asked not to tell Eun Oh.

00:06:06.524 --> 00:06:07.524
Right.

00:06:08.124 --> 00:06:09.134
Got it.

00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:12.964
So, he can start practicing walking, right?

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:15.574
He keeps insisting on using the wheelchair.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.174
He can start with some light walking.

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:21.144
Walking a little bit at a time will help with his recovery.

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:23.814
See?

00:06:25.414 --> 00:06:28.654
- I understand. - Call us if there are any problems.

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:38.224
Now, I can finally breathe easier.

00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:40.224
And you heard what he said, right?

00:06:40.764 --> 00:06:43.194
You need to focus on recovering as quickly as possible.

00:06:43.594 --> 00:06:46.404
I'll practice walking with the caregiver,

00:06:47.234 --> 00:06:48.374
so you can go home now.

00:06:50.904 --> 00:06:51.904
Woo Jin.

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:55.874
Ever since you started having liver problems,

00:06:56.744 --> 00:06:58.814
I've had to come here behind Chairman Park's back.

00:06:59.444 --> 00:07:02.254
Don't you forget how I've been living on pins and needles.

00:07:04.514 --> 00:07:07.924
Making you so wary after I remarried and brought you into this family...

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:11.024
I did it because I wanted to make it all up to you.

00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:12.694
You know that, don't you?

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.364
When you get out of the hospital and go back to the US,

00:07:20.864 --> 00:07:22.434
you need to kick it into high gear.

00:07:23.274 --> 00:07:25.074
Manage your last semester well...

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:28.844
and ensure you get better grades than Park Seong Jae, okay?

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:30.544
I...

00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:35.314
Mom, do you still believe I can beat Seong Jae?

00:07:37.854 --> 00:07:38.884
Of course, I do.

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:41.684
Because you have to beat Seong Jae. No matter what.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.824
No matter how much Park Seong Jae has changed,

00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:46.664
you will become even stronger.

00:07:56.004 --> 00:07:58.844
Here are the scholarship candidates, sent from each school.

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.644
You need them sorted by the end of the year, right?

00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:01.674
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:07.984 --> 00:08:10.154
I just felt a little dizzy,

00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:14.054
but Seong Jae dragged me here for a CT scan.

00:08:14.954 --> 00:08:16.554
As of today, Seong Jae is the Vice President.

00:08:16.894 --> 00:08:18.154
Seong Jae was the one who found it.

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:21.024
The subtle difference between 3A and 2A grade.

00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:24.894
I made sure he had no ambition,

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.804
so why has he suddenly changed?

00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:30.234
People don't just change for no reason.

00:08:31.374 --> 00:08:34.044
Because Seong Jae changed, Chairman Park changed too.

00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:48.524
(Detective Agency)

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:52.194
Have you hired us before?

00:08:52.194 --> 00:08:53.924
No. This is the first time.

00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:57.634
If you can start today, I'll pay an extra 50 percent.

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:00.564
Yes, we can start immediately. Please send us the subject's info.

00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:06.004
What am I going to do...

00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:08.174
Seong Jae, what's wrong?

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.314
Ji Hyuk's grandmother passed away.

00:09:12.414 --> 00:09:13.644
I just came home to change.

00:09:15.584 --> 00:09:16.614
Ji Hyuk?

00:09:17.854 --> 00:09:19.424
Isn't that Ji Wan's older brother's name?

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:29.464
Wait, so is it Ji Wan's grandmother who passed away?

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:32.264
Yes.

00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:33.864
Why all of a sudden?

00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:36.634
But I heard she was even going to be in a fashion show.

00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:38.604
She was in a car accident,

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.474
and I guess the shock caused a heart attack.

00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:46.144
That's terrible. Ji Wan must be so devastated.

00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:50.484
We're all in shock. I still can't believe it myself.

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:53.984
She was in such good health, too.

00:09:56.454 --> 00:09:58.254
I guess you really never know when your time will come.

00:09:58.794 --> 00:10:01.024
Yeong Ra, I'm going to go change.

00:10:01.524 --> 00:10:02.534
Okay.

00:10:28.024 --> 00:10:29.054
No.

00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:31.624
It's my mother-in-law's funeral.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:37.664
I should be there to see her off. How can I just lie here like this?

00:10:38.064 --> 00:10:40.364
There's nothing for you to do, Mom.

00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:44.104
Ji Wan went to get her portrait,

00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:46.574
and Ji Hyuk is handling the funeral arrangements.

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:48.744
He didn't even invite anyone from AP.

00:10:49.214 --> 00:10:51.944
Dad wanted a small service, just for the family.

00:10:54.184 --> 00:10:57.454
You should at least go. You need to be there.

00:10:58.054 --> 00:11:01.854
- Isn't the caregiver coming soon? - I'll go when they get here, Mom.

00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:11.494
Mom.

00:11:13.404 --> 00:11:16.404
Mom, you need to stay in bed. Okay?

00:11:23.644 --> 00:11:24.644
Ji Hyuk...

00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:29.114
Mom... Thank you.

00:11:33.054 --> 00:11:34.254
I know this isn't the time, but...

00:11:38.094 --> 00:11:39.264
Thank you for being okay.

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:43.294
I was so scared, thinking...

00:11:44.634 --> 00:11:46.204
something terrible had happened to you too.

00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:54.044
But how is your father holding up?

00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:57.014
Dad...

00:11:59.544 --> 00:12:00.814
He's just in a daze.

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:04.454
It's because Grandma's passing was so sudden.

00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:08.854
I don't think it's sunk in for him yet.

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:16.864
It doesn't matter how old he is. His mother is still his mother.

00:12:22.204 --> 00:12:24.004
Make sure to look after your father, Ji Hyuk.

00:12:28.074 --> 00:12:29.114
I will.

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:32.884
You just focus on resting like you were told,

00:12:34.684 --> 00:12:39.524
and if you feel nauseous or dizzy, tell the caregiver right away. Okay?

00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:44.724
Stop worrying about me. The living have to go on.

00:12:46.024 --> 00:12:47.664
Go on, get back to the funeral preparations.

00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:49.864
Your father won't be able to think straight.

00:13:05.144 --> 00:13:06.144
Okay.

00:13:07.314 --> 00:13:08.444
I will.

00:13:25.164 --> 00:13:27.864
Hey, I brought Grandma's portrait.

00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:30.334
Okay.

00:13:51.394 --> 00:13:52.794
Grandma...

00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:56.934
Did you frame it?

00:13:58.634 --> 00:13:59.634
No.

00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:02.474
Grandma...

00:14:03.874 --> 00:14:05.474
It turns out she had it prepared already.

00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:09.244
Grandma...

00:14:20.784 --> 00:14:22.324
Grandma...

00:14:24.954 --> 00:14:28.864
It wasn't your time yet. Grandma...

00:14:29.964 --> 00:14:32.464
It's too soon.

00:14:32.964 --> 00:14:37.634
Grandma!

00:14:41.274 --> 00:14:45.114
It's too soon. Grandma!

00:14:48.444 --> 00:14:49.654
No...

00:14:50.114 --> 00:14:51.314
Su Bin.

00:14:52.884 --> 00:14:55.324
It's time to put up Grandma's portrait.

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:59.124
No, not my grandma!

00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.504
Grandma...

00:15:12.604 --> 00:15:13.874
Oh, dear...

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.884
The last time we were all together was at Ji Hyuk's wedding.

00:15:55.114 --> 00:15:57.054
And now, we're all here for her funeral.

00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:04.154
Is Dad going to the restroom?

00:16:08.324 --> 00:16:12.964
Sang Cheol's taking this hard. He hasn't even had a drink.

00:16:14.464 --> 00:16:16.634
She passed so suddenly, without any warning.

00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:20.344
- He must be full of regrets. - At least it wasn't like his dad.

00:16:20.804 --> 00:16:24.514
This is better than enduring a long illness like his father did.

00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:25.984
Hey, this is his mother we're talking about.

00:16:26.484 --> 00:16:27.944
How can you compare that to his father?

00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:32.054
Not being able to show his mother he got a new job...

00:16:32.854 --> 00:16:34.424
must be what's really weighing on him.

00:16:35.324 --> 00:16:37.194
He's been the provider all his life, you know?

00:16:38.824 --> 00:16:41.494
- See you around. - Yes, see you. I'm heading out.

00:16:41.994 --> 00:16:43.564
- All right. - Thank you for coming.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.004
Thanks for coming, everyone. Go home. You have work tomorrow.

00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:54.904
Yes, of course. Take good care of your father.

00:16:55.544 --> 00:16:56.974
And I'm sorry I didn't get to see your mom.

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:02.814
Su Bin will collapse at this rate. She won't stop crying.

00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:07.954
Ji Hyuk, you see our friends out. I'll go check on Su Bin.

00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:09.854
Okay. Make sure she eats, Seong Jae.

00:17:10.424 --> 00:17:11.424
- Let's go. - Bye.

00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:14.364
All right, let's head out.

00:17:21.234 --> 00:17:22.234
Su Bin.

00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:24.574
Come on, you should at least have some soup.

00:17:27.244 --> 00:17:28.744
I don't have an appetite.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.154
What's taking him so long?

00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:12.924
He's been gone for a while now.

00:18:20.164 --> 00:18:21.524
Where on earth could he have gone?

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:32.844
Mom!

00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:36.644
Mom...

00:18:40.344 --> 00:18:42.144
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:18:42.144 --> 00:18:44.284
I'm so sorry...

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:49.324
Mom...

00:18:53.664 --> 00:18:54.724
Mom.

00:18:57.194 --> 00:18:58.194
Please...

00:19:01.364 --> 00:19:04.234
Please. No... This can't be happening.

00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:18.254
I'm so sorry, I am!

00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:19.484
Sorry...

00:19:23.154 --> 00:19:26.024
Mom...

00:19:43.844 --> 00:19:45.144
What are you doing just sitting here?

00:19:46.314 --> 00:19:47.584
Haven't you found your dad yet?

00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:49.914
Seong Jae, my dad...

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.554
He was saying, "Mom..."

00:19:56.754 --> 00:19:59.364
and just sobbing.

00:20:02.424 --> 00:20:03.434
What?

00:20:03.934 --> 00:20:06.234
I've never seen him sob like that before.

00:20:08.604 --> 00:20:09.734
It was so jarring,

00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:12.134
and I was just stunned.

00:20:14.374 --> 00:20:15.574
Your dad...

00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:18.344
was sobbing?

00:20:19.014 --> 00:20:20.344
Thinking about it now...

00:20:24.384 --> 00:20:25.484
I never realized.

00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:30.154
I knew Grandma was my dad's mother,

00:20:32.594 --> 00:20:33.964
but the idea that for my dad, Grandma was...

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:38.094
what my own mom is to me.

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:41.204
It never even crossed my mind.

00:20:43.474 --> 00:20:46.274
When I heard Mom was unconscious and rushed to the ER,

00:20:47.604 --> 00:20:49.214
I honestly thought I was going to lose it.

00:20:55.414 --> 00:20:57.154
I was terrified I was going to lose her.

00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:01.424
All the things I should have done for her...

00:21:02.754 --> 00:21:03.824
All my regrets...

00:21:06.624 --> 00:21:09.434
My entire life with her flashed before my eyes.

00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:12.334
All I could think was, "Not yet."

00:21:15.134 --> 00:21:16.134
"It's too soon."

00:21:19.004 --> 00:21:20.174
My heart just seized up,

00:21:23.414 --> 00:21:25.274
and it felt like all the blood had drained from my face.

00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:35.124
My mom's gone, so I can't really know.

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:41.464
But I think I get what you were feeling.

00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:46.304
My dad, too...

00:21:49.234 --> 00:21:52.134
That's exactly how he must have felt about his own parents.

00:21:57.114 --> 00:21:58.114
Only now...

00:21:59.644 --> 00:22:00.784
Why is it only now...

00:22:02.044 --> 00:22:03.684
that I'm finally getting it?

00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:06.224
Honestly, back then,

00:22:07.124 --> 00:22:09.494
my father's life was on the line,

00:22:10.154 --> 00:22:13.264
so I felt like I couldn't apologize to my own son.

00:22:14.724 --> 00:22:15.994
Because if I did,

00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:19.064
it would've felt like I was blaming my own sick father.

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:22.204
It was because of my own father that I made you give up your dream.

00:22:22.264 --> 00:22:24.404
Should I beg for your forgiveness?

00:22:31.274 --> 00:22:35.214
I wish I'd understood him better, even a little.

00:22:52.534 --> 00:22:54.204
I was just on my way down.

00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:56.374
I have to ask you something first.

00:22:58.004 --> 00:23:00.104
I noticed your car is still parked out front.

00:23:02.204 --> 00:23:05.674
Manager Lee Ji Wan will submit his resignation to Dad himself.

00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:08.814
Finally, you're starting to make sense.

00:23:10.454 --> 00:23:12.584
So, when are you meeting with Vice President Lee?

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.424
Vice President Lee Sang Hoon?

00:23:16.154 --> 00:23:17.154
I won't meet him.

00:23:18.124 --> 00:23:19.124
What?

00:23:20.364 --> 00:23:22.494
Dad already said I didn't have to.

00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:26.704
Then just tell him you want to meet. That you changed your mind.

00:23:27.204 --> 00:23:28.234
Why should I?

00:23:29.604 --> 00:23:30.634
You really don't know?

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:32.034
No.

00:23:32.874 --> 00:23:35.944
I don't want to see him, so I don't get why I have to.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:43.854
What?

00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:55.224
Yeong Ra.

00:23:55.864 --> 00:23:58.334
Do you still not feel well?

00:23:59.234 --> 00:24:01.464
Then you should go to a doctor. Why are you cooped up at home?

00:24:03.104 --> 00:24:04.774
I'm not really sick.

00:24:04.974 --> 00:24:06.074
I think I've just got the winter blues.

00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:07.974
My studio's a bit chilly.

00:24:08.344 --> 00:24:11.714
Well, why did you rent such a cheap place?

00:24:12.014 --> 00:24:14.584
Because she treats it like she's just playing house.

00:24:15.184 --> 00:24:18.484
Why does she need an office when she lives in this huge house?

00:24:18.484 --> 00:24:19.654
It's not like she has a job.

00:24:23.324 --> 00:24:24.794
Are you feeling down too, honey?

00:24:25.394 --> 00:24:26.924
That doesn't sound like you.

00:24:28.594 --> 00:24:31.364
Especially since we launched her career with a solo exhibition.

00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:35.734
Well, she's the one who said she didn't want to paint anymore.

00:24:37.034 --> 00:24:39.034
I might find a new career path there.

00:24:39.804 --> 00:24:41.344
Right, of course.

00:24:42.404 --> 00:24:45.744
You've been so busy up until now, so take your time and think it over.

00:24:46.384 --> 00:24:49.514
You should explore your dreams before you get married.

00:25:03.064 --> 00:25:06.534
Why does she need an office? She doesn't even have a job.

00:25:08.334 --> 00:25:09.674
What does she mean I don't have a job?

00:25:10.374 --> 00:25:11.904
She knows perfectly well I'm a webtoon artist.

00:25:14.944 --> 00:25:16.214
You're nothing on your own.

00:25:16.844 --> 00:25:18.814
You even had a ghost painter.

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:20.884
You have nothing that's actually yours.

00:25:21.744 --> 00:25:24.154
Wait, you have your webtoon.

00:25:24.584 --> 00:25:27.784
But you can't even publish it. So, you're a nobody.

00:25:28.354 --> 00:25:29.424
Resign.

00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:31.724
And give me the car keys.

00:25:32.354 --> 00:25:35.164
Let's not see each other again.

00:25:38.394 --> 00:25:40.834
He tried so hard for me, and yet...

00:25:42.404 --> 00:25:43.874
I shouldn't have been so cruel.

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:50.244
And right after that, he heard that his grandmother died.

00:25:55.614 --> 00:25:58.214
Looks like Dokgo Chan and So Ri will spend Christmas together.

00:25:58.584 --> 00:26:00.184
Where do you think they are now?

00:26:01.124 --> 00:26:03.894
They're heading to Busan, so maybe somewhere around Daegu?

00:26:04.424 --> 00:26:05.454
Daegu...

00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:08.194
I wonder if the malls there are picked clean.

00:26:08.594 --> 00:26:11.534
It'd be sweet if they picked out gifts for each other.

00:26:12.594 --> 00:26:16.004
Then let's go to a department store on Christmas Eve.

00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:17.304
For research, you know.

00:26:17.704 --> 00:26:18.774
I can't that day.

00:26:19.304 --> 00:26:21.574
I promised my grandma I'd take her to the Nam Hun Ah concert.

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:25.774
With your grandma on Christmas Eve? To a concert like that?

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:29.044
My grandma's birthday is on Christmas Eve.

00:26:29.444 --> 00:26:31.684
And I've never once done anything special for her.

00:26:42.494 --> 00:26:43.494
Pretty cool, right?

00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:45.594
A grandson taking his grandma to a concert.

00:26:50.704 --> 00:26:52.174
It's the other way around.

00:26:52.434 --> 00:26:55.744
So for men, when you bow, your right hand goes on top.

00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:59.344
And for women, your left hand goes on top.

00:27:00.514 --> 00:27:04.054
Next, raise your hands to eye level, and your palms...

00:27:07.424 --> 00:27:08.424
Where are you going?

00:27:09.324 --> 00:27:10.994
You're dressed all in black.

00:27:12.294 --> 00:27:14.924
Ji Wan's grandmother passed away, so I'm going to pay my respects.

00:27:15.794 --> 00:27:18.194
What? Why would you go there?

00:27:18.734 --> 00:27:19.764
Because I want to.

00:27:21.564 --> 00:27:22.564
I'll go with you.

00:27:22.934 --> 00:27:24.274
I'll go give them the condolence money.

00:27:24.274 --> 00:27:25.304
You stay in the car.

00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:30.144
I don't want to just give money. I want to pay my respects properly.

00:27:30.644 --> 00:27:33.514
- Bowing and paying my respects. - And why would you do that?

00:27:34.484 --> 00:27:37.254
What kind of employer attends an employee's family funeral?

00:27:38.214 --> 00:27:40.024
Show some class.

00:27:40.724 --> 00:27:42.384
He's not my employee.

00:27:42.384 --> 00:27:44.894
He's the one Dad asked to protect me.

00:27:45.194 --> 00:27:46.994
And he's the younger brother of one of Seong Jae's friends.

00:27:47.964 --> 00:27:49.064
Mom.

00:27:49.394 --> 00:27:50.594
You're the one who needs to show some decency.

00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:53.934
Hey!

00:27:57.734 --> 00:28:00.504
Yeong Ra, don't! That girl...

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:44.154
Dad, there are no visitors now. Please get something to eat.

00:28:57.994 --> 00:29:01.204
Step before the deceased's portrait to offer a flower.

00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:06.074
Dad, hold on.

00:29:15.814 --> 00:29:18.514
Then, bow twice,

00:29:18.514 --> 00:29:23.024
and silently wish them peace or say your final goodbyes.

00:29:32.664 --> 00:29:34.034
Hello, Grandma.

00:29:35.434 --> 00:29:37.604
I'm a close friend of Ji Wan's.

00:29:39.574 --> 00:29:41.744
May you rest in peace, Grandma.

00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:48.944
Ji Wan.

00:29:55.684 --> 00:29:59.454
I'm Park Yeong Ra. I'm a friend of Ji Wan's.

00:30:00.164 --> 00:30:01.394
A friend, she says.

00:30:01.924 --> 00:30:04.134
I'm very sorry for your loss.

00:30:04.634 --> 00:30:05.994
Thank you.

00:30:06.294 --> 00:30:09.874
So you really do see me as a friend, at least.

00:30:24.554 --> 00:30:26.054
How did you get here?

00:30:31.524 --> 00:30:34.564
Of course, I should be here. She's my bodyguard's grandmother.

00:30:36.264 --> 00:30:37.394
You're very thoughtful.

00:30:40.204 --> 00:30:43.574
You must be upset you couldn't take your grandma to the concert.

00:30:57.454 --> 00:30:58.884
I'm such a fool.

00:30:59.314 --> 00:31:00.824
What did I do for her last birthday...

00:31:03.254 --> 00:31:05.024
And the year before that...

00:31:06.494 --> 00:31:08.064
Her birthday was only ten days away.

00:31:15.304 --> 00:31:18.674
How many grandsons even think about taking their grandma to a concert?

00:31:19.904 --> 00:31:21.444
It's like you two went together.

00:31:21.974 --> 00:31:23.244
What would you know?

00:31:23.644 --> 00:31:25.214
I bet that's what your grandmother thinks.

00:31:25.774 --> 00:31:28.884
Now that she's passed, she can read your mind.

00:31:29.544 --> 00:31:31.214
She'll be with you in spirit, right?

00:31:37.224 --> 00:31:38.924
I really hope so.

00:31:45.964 --> 00:31:47.134
Park Yeong Ra.

00:31:47.404 --> 00:31:50.404
Wait, did you drive here yourself? Are you out of your mind?

00:31:51.434 --> 00:31:53.174
I told you. I can drive.

00:31:53.204 --> 00:31:56.274
That stalker is still out there awaiting trial.

00:31:56.274 --> 00:31:58.114
Have you lost your mind?

00:32:00.214 --> 00:32:01.214
Right.

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:03.414
It's been ages since he showed up, so I'd forgotten.

00:32:07.854 --> 00:32:10.794
Besides, I need to start doing this on my own.

00:32:11.024 --> 00:32:13.594
Attending a funeral is a big part of being an adult.

00:32:14.364 --> 00:32:15.424
Give me the keys.

00:32:15.424 --> 00:32:19.234
I'll drive myself. What, are you my bodyguard?

00:32:19.864 --> 00:32:24.374
I haven't resigned yet. So, I'm still your bodyguard.

00:32:25.574 --> 00:32:27.274
A bodyguard who's at his grandma's funeral.

00:32:27.274 --> 00:32:28.674
I don't want to make you drive me home.

00:32:32.514 --> 00:32:34.084
You've gotten a lot braver.

00:32:35.784 --> 00:32:36.954
I wonder who I have to thank for that.

00:32:38.714 --> 00:32:40.254
I'm not scared anymore either.

00:32:41.784 --> 00:32:43.254
Not scared at all.

00:32:44.524 --> 00:32:45.724
I'm not afraid.

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.294
What's that supposed to mean?

00:32:49.424 --> 00:32:50.494
Yeong Ra.

00:32:51.294 --> 00:32:52.794
You wouldn't know about this, would you?

00:32:53.434 --> 00:32:54.864
When there's a warning,

00:32:58.134 --> 00:32:59.334
it's easier to defend yourself.

00:32:59.734 --> 00:33:00.904
Easier?

00:33:01.344 --> 00:33:05.344
How is it easy when you don't know when, where, or what will happen?

00:33:06.574 --> 00:33:08.444
She warned me, didn't she?

00:33:08.544 --> 00:33:11.554
That she'd arrange a fatal accident that could kill me.

00:33:12.184 --> 00:33:13.184
That was the threat.

00:33:13.654 --> 00:33:17.054
If that's the case, it lays everything out for me.

00:33:18.024 --> 00:33:20.894
The scenarios are predictable, which makes it easy to defend.

00:33:23.864 --> 00:33:27.004
You're not scared of my mom?

00:33:28.104 --> 00:33:29.364
Director Ko...

00:33:29.764 --> 00:33:32.634
She can't tell the Chairman unless I resign first.

00:33:33.074 --> 00:33:35.604
And you're afraid your family will be torn apart,

00:33:35.604 --> 00:33:37.714
so you can't tell him about Woo Jin's liver transplant.

00:33:38.014 --> 00:33:42.044
She has even more to lose. So, we're at a stalemate.

00:33:44.284 --> 00:33:45.484
I know that.

00:33:45.754 --> 00:33:48.884
So, I'm the wild card here.

00:33:50.124 --> 00:33:51.254
But I...

00:33:53.324 --> 00:33:54.994
have no intention of backing down.

00:33:56.094 --> 00:33:57.764
I'm your bodyguard, aren't I?

00:33:58.434 --> 00:34:01.934
And it's not just about stalkers, you know.

00:34:05.534 --> 00:34:07.374
It means protecting your life.

00:34:08.304 --> 00:34:09.444
At least, for as long as I'm your bodyguard.

00:34:14.284 --> 00:34:18.784
Hey, I was a college athlete. I'm not going down that easily.

00:34:20.424 --> 00:34:23.754
So, the decision is up to you.

00:34:24.294 --> 00:34:27.924
At the very least, that beloved series of yours...

00:34:28.294 --> 00:34:29.694
I'll make sure you get to finish it safely.

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.864
That's all you wanted, right?

00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:37.804
Give me the car keys.

00:34:45.344 --> 00:34:47.984
Seeing how my grandmother was here yesterday and gone today...

00:34:50.414 --> 00:34:52.354
makes me realize you never know when your time is up.

00:35:00.494 --> 00:35:01.594
I'm leaving.

00:35:09.434 --> 00:35:11.474
You could die on the way home.

00:35:27.384 --> 00:35:30.294
Here are today's files. Upload them, and you can go home.

00:35:30.424 --> 00:35:31.424
Okay.

00:35:40.334 --> 00:35:41.704
She's running a fever.

00:35:45.374 --> 00:35:46.904
- Seong Jae. - Hey.

00:35:47.104 --> 00:35:49.604
Hey. What are you doing back here?

00:35:53.374 --> 00:35:55.384
It's your grandmother's funeral. Of course, I should be here.

00:35:56.784 --> 00:35:59.854
In that case, Seong Jae, could you take Su Bin home?

00:36:00.154 --> 00:36:03.384
Maybe it's from all the crying, but she has a high fever.

00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:05.854
I think she should sleep at home tonight.

00:36:07.424 --> 00:36:09.224
Should we get her an IV?

00:36:09.724 --> 00:36:10.894
I don't think it's that serious.

00:36:12.334 --> 00:36:15.204
I'm just worried she'll keep crying if she stays here.

00:36:15.534 --> 00:36:17.304
Just pick up some medicine for her on the way.

00:36:19.204 --> 00:36:20.204
All right, got it.

00:36:27.984 --> 00:36:29.484
I'm home.

00:36:29.884 --> 00:36:30.984
Yeong Ra.

00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:33.354
I thought you were going to stay home.

00:36:33.984 --> 00:36:35.524
Where are you coming from?

00:36:36.584 --> 00:36:40.294
Mr. Lee's grandmother passed away, so I went to the funeral.

00:36:40.724 --> 00:36:42.194
Mr. Lee's grandmother?

00:36:43.994 --> 00:36:47.164
We could've just sent some condolence money. Aren't you cold?

00:36:47.564 --> 00:36:48.704
My thoughts exactly.

00:36:50.434 --> 00:36:52.674
But he's been protecting me for months.

00:36:53.134 --> 00:36:56.004
I felt it was right to go pay my respects in person.

00:36:57.474 --> 00:36:58.514
You're right.

00:36:59.414 --> 00:37:03.444
- He protects you every day. - And he saved my life.

00:37:04.814 --> 00:37:05.914
That's right.

00:37:07.624 --> 00:37:09.524
- I'm heading up. - All right.

00:37:15.864 --> 00:37:19.194
She went all the way to a funeral for his grandmother, not a parent.

00:37:20.964 --> 00:37:23.834
I think she's been spending too much time with him.

00:37:25.274 --> 00:37:27.344
So you forgot too.

00:37:28.004 --> 00:37:31.044
He is Yeong Ra's lifesaver.

00:37:31.474 --> 00:37:34.714
If she'd been abducted that day, who knows what could have happened?

00:37:44.794 --> 00:37:46.224
That's right.

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:49.194
Menopause is making me so forgetful. I keep forgetting things.

00:37:51.334 --> 00:37:54.064
I was just worried Yeong Ra is losing her class.

00:37:54.964 --> 00:37:57.534
After all, their upbringings are so different.

00:37:58.904 --> 00:38:00.544
But there are things to be learned from that, too.

00:38:00.944 --> 00:38:02.774
She's learned how to look after the people around her.

00:38:03.674 --> 00:38:05.514
Yeong Ra has really matured.

00:38:25.794 --> 00:38:26.794
Right now,

00:38:27.134 --> 00:38:29.634
you might think that what you have is enough.

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:31.834
But listen to me.

00:38:32.374 --> 00:38:33.904
If you let this chance with Jinhwa slip away,

00:38:34.244 --> 00:38:36.674
you'll never be able to climb any higher than this.

00:38:37.844 --> 00:38:41.184
- Mom. - You'll have to marry down, right?

00:38:42.184 --> 00:38:44.254
Just imagine taking that one step down.

00:38:45.314 --> 00:38:48.524
The kind of pecking order and all the classism you'll face...

00:38:49.484 --> 00:38:50.994
I'm telling you, you have no idea.

00:38:51.594 --> 00:38:52.894
All that classism and discrimination.

00:38:53.924 --> 00:38:55.624
When I married your father,

00:38:55.664 --> 00:38:58.434
do you have any idea what I endured, even after we got married?

00:39:00.094 --> 00:39:02.704
Dad's family treated you like a gold digger,

00:39:03.134 --> 00:39:06.004
and you were shut out and ostracized by the industry.

00:39:07.174 --> 00:39:09.174
To be a woman worthy of your father,

00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:12.274
I went beyond high school by getting my master's at night,

00:39:12.344 --> 00:39:13.914
completed an executive management program,

00:39:14.184 --> 00:39:16.514
took English, Japanese, and etiquette classes,

00:39:16.514 --> 00:39:18.814
and volunteered at different places. I did everything I possibly could.

00:39:19.854 --> 00:39:22.124
Mom, I...

00:39:22.624 --> 00:39:25.324
I'm fine not marrying into a family on the same level as Jinhwa Group.

00:39:25.524 --> 00:39:26.524
Are you out of your mind?

00:39:27.464 --> 00:39:30.064
You only get one life. Do you really want to throw it away?

00:39:31.534 --> 00:39:32.794
Some guy like Lee Ji Wan?

00:39:34.064 --> 00:39:36.564
Do you know what your life would be like...

00:39:36.564 --> 00:39:38.074
with a guy like that? With no support at all?

00:39:39.074 --> 00:39:42.304
In less than three months, you'll be worried sick about money.

00:39:42.904 --> 00:39:45.774
Those clothes you want to buy? You could never afford them.

00:39:46.614 --> 00:39:48.884
You'll go to department stores and look at the price tags first.

00:39:49.314 --> 00:39:52.114
Actually, you probably won't be able to go to department stores.

00:39:53.084 --> 00:39:54.754
You'll be lucky if you can even shop at an outlet.

00:39:55.054 --> 00:39:57.294
Makeup, food, art shows, trips...

00:39:57.724 --> 00:39:59.154
You'll have to check the price on everything first.

00:40:00.394 --> 00:40:03.764
I have absolutely no intention of marrying Mr. Lee Ji Wan.

00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:06.264
Lie down with dogs, and you'll get up with fleas.

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.934
That means, don't even let him near you.

00:40:10.164 --> 00:40:12.574
If the wrong rumors start, it will only lower your stock.

00:40:13.604 --> 00:40:14.604
Mom.

00:40:14.944 --> 00:40:16.974
Please, don't be so dramatic about it.

00:40:17.674 --> 00:40:19.674
Ji Wan is just my bodyguard.

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:21.614
You don't need to worry so much.

00:40:25.484 --> 00:40:28.324
Even Dad said I did the right thing by going to pay my respects.

00:40:28.554 --> 00:40:31.194
I don't even know if we're on the same page right now.

00:40:32.194 --> 00:40:33.794
We're going to have to talk about this later.

00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:35.564
Okay.

00:40:36.624 --> 00:40:38.064
I really have to use the bathroom right now.

00:40:45.974 --> 00:40:48.074
So this guy is pretty capable.

00:40:49.144 --> 00:40:50.674
He's the problem.

00:40:53.344 --> 00:40:54.944
All right. I see.

00:40:55.944 --> 00:40:57.044
You two...

00:40:57.984 --> 00:40:59.314
I'll take you both out in one shot.

00:41:00.554 --> 00:41:02.784
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:41:03.124 --> 00:41:04.194
What do you want to eat?

00:41:04.554 --> 00:41:06.724
The porridge.

00:41:07.894 --> 00:41:11.594
I wish he'd brought more of it. You enjoy it so much.

00:41:12.294 --> 00:41:14.904
He said he learned how to make it from his grandmother.

00:41:16.704 --> 00:41:19.834
Once you're done, it'll be all gone, so I'll make you some.

00:41:20.174 --> 00:41:22.674
Gosh, it's okay. I don't need to eat porridge anymore.

00:41:24.244 --> 00:41:26.844
All right. I'll make you lots of other delicious food.

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:29.314
Okay, go on and eat your porridge.

00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:30.984
Yes, okay.

00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:45.334
Hey, Su Jeong.

00:41:45.864 --> 00:41:46.964
How are you feeling?

00:41:48.404 --> 00:41:49.934
I'm recovering well.

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:51.474
That's a relief.

00:41:53.034 --> 00:41:54.804
What's this? Just calling to check on me?

00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.374
Or are you bored...

00:41:56.544 --> 00:41:58.014
and just want to chat?

00:41:59.144 --> 00:42:00.244
Actually...

00:42:00.914 --> 00:42:03.714
Ji Hyuk told me not to tell you,

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.954
but I think you need to know.

00:42:06.514 --> 00:42:08.784
Ji Hyuk's grandmother passed away.

00:42:13.454 --> 00:42:15.494
What? His grandmother?

00:42:16.694 --> 00:42:17.694
What happened all of a sudden?

00:42:24.574 --> 00:42:25.674
I see.

00:42:27.674 --> 00:42:28.774
Where's the funeral home?

00:42:29.904 --> 00:42:33.014
Don't even think about it. Ji Hyuk will kill me if you go.

00:42:36.544 --> 00:42:38.054
Just send him a text with your condolences.

00:42:38.784 --> 00:42:39.784
Get some rest, Eun Oh.

00:42:48.294 --> 00:42:49.324
Ji Hyuk...

00:42:49.824 --> 00:42:51.864
He lived with his grandmother for so long...

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:19.054
Wait, is that Eun Oh?

00:43:20.294 --> 00:43:21.464
Oh, it's her.

00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:23.934
What is she doing here?

00:43:25.064 --> 00:43:26.894
(CEO Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:43:28.134 --> 00:43:29.134
Eun Oh.

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.034
Why don't you ever listen?

00:43:32.534 --> 00:43:34.804
Are you in any condition to be paying respects?

00:43:35.204 --> 00:43:37.874
You must still have stomach pains. Why would you come all this way?

00:43:38.644 --> 00:43:39.714
Who told you?

00:43:40.114 --> 00:43:41.514
I specifically told them not to tell you.

00:43:42.444 --> 00:43:44.254
Gosh, you're really giving me an earful.

00:43:45.254 --> 00:43:46.254
What?

00:43:49.184 --> 00:43:50.284
Here, just take this.

00:43:52.124 --> 00:43:53.254
What's this?

00:43:53.894 --> 00:43:55.224
It's your grandmother's porridge.

00:43:55.864 --> 00:43:57.534
The one you brought me when I was in the hospital.

00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:00.134
You learned how to make it from your grandmother...

00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.164
and brought it to me, remember?

00:44:03.234 --> 00:44:05.574
Wait, you still had some of this left?

00:44:06.334 --> 00:44:07.974
You brought me so much...

00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:10.974
that my mom froze it in single-serving portions.

00:44:11.814 --> 00:44:14.114
I checked today, and there was one serving left.

00:44:15.414 --> 00:44:17.314
But since it was your grandmother's porridge,

00:44:18.414 --> 00:44:20.684
I thought it would be best if you ate the last one.

00:44:22.284 --> 00:44:23.784
You haven't been eating, have you?

00:44:25.394 --> 00:44:26.394
This...

00:44:29.764 --> 00:44:31.294
I made this batch with my grandmother.

00:44:33.394 --> 00:44:34.404
She nagged me the whole time.

00:44:37.264 --> 00:44:38.774
Nagged you? Why?

00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:40.944
She was teaching me,

00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:44.314
and I was the one who was supposed to cook.

00:44:46.244 --> 00:44:47.914
But she ended up mincing the abalone...

00:44:50.314 --> 00:44:51.484
and the beef too.

00:44:54.454 --> 00:44:55.524
She even checked the seasoning for me.

00:45:00.024 --> 00:45:01.624
Because I'm useless at mincing things like abalone,

00:45:02.494 --> 00:45:03.624
and I can't season to save my life.

00:45:08.704 --> 00:45:10.564
So it really was her porridge after all.

00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:12.934
No wonder it tasted so good.

00:45:17.814 --> 00:45:19.074
Hurry and eat it while it's warm.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.514
May your grandmother rest in peace.

00:45:25.184 --> 00:45:26.184
Eun Oh.

00:45:29.554 --> 00:45:30.954
Just for a little while, while I eat this...

00:45:32.554 --> 00:45:33.754
Can you stay here with me?

00:45:57.914 --> 00:45:58.954
It's really good.

00:46:29.014 --> 00:46:30.014
Su Bin.

00:46:30.514 --> 00:46:31.514
Let's go home.

00:46:37.424 --> 00:46:38.424
Su Bin.

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:42.394
Grandma...

00:46:43.394 --> 00:46:45.134
You made her so happy.

00:46:47.464 --> 00:46:50.104
She had such a fun time appearing on your YouTube channel,

00:46:51.474 --> 00:46:53.374
and she even got to debut as a model because of it.

00:46:55.444 --> 00:46:57.104
Plus, all your subscribers loved her so much.

00:47:04.044 --> 00:47:05.214
You know what they say?

00:47:07.284 --> 00:47:08.324
If you cry too much,

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.624
they say the person who passed can't move on.

00:47:15.394 --> 00:47:16.394
Really?

00:47:17.394 --> 00:47:18.394
Yes.

00:47:19.794 --> 00:47:21.604
So for your grandmother's sake,

00:47:22.534 --> 00:47:23.534
try to stop crying.

00:47:37.954 --> 00:47:38.954
Su Bin?

00:48:06.014 --> 00:48:07.014
Su Bin.

00:48:07.344 --> 00:48:09.044
If you wake up, take more medicine and go back to sleep.

00:48:09.914 --> 00:48:11.114
I'll come get you early tomorrow morning.

00:48:54.124 --> 00:48:55.194
Seong Jae.

00:48:56.024 --> 00:48:57.024
Seong Jae.

00:48:59.664 --> 00:49:00.904
Hey, Su Bin.

00:49:01.734 --> 00:49:02.734
You're awake?

00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:05.104
How are you feeling?

00:49:06.074 --> 00:49:09.104
Seong Jae. What are you doing sleeping here?

00:49:10.744 --> 00:49:11.744
I was waiting for you to wake up...

00:49:12.114 --> 00:49:14.544
to give you your medicine and make sure your fever broke.

00:49:19.684 --> 00:49:21.984
It's gone down a little, at least.

00:49:23.724 --> 00:49:26.754
They said to take another dose. Just a second.

00:49:29.464 --> 00:49:30.464
Oh, boy.

00:49:34.534 --> 00:49:35.534
Here.

00:49:39.434 --> 00:49:40.434
Thanks, Seong Jae.

00:49:43.874 --> 00:49:45.814
I'll be sleeping in Ji Hyuk's room,

00:49:46.514 --> 00:49:48.544
so you should change into pajamas and get some rest.

00:49:49.644 --> 00:49:51.314
You're going to sleep in Ji Hyuk's room?

00:49:52.854 --> 00:49:55.684
I couldn't just leave you here while you're sick.

00:49:56.854 --> 00:49:59.954
Call me if you feel any worse at all, okay?

00:50:01.294 --> 00:50:02.294
Okay.

00:50:04.024 --> 00:50:05.034
Make sure you take your medicine.

00:51:01.284 --> 00:51:02.284
All right.

00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:04.494
You've all been through so much.

00:51:05.094 --> 00:51:06.954
Su Bin, go take your medicine and lie down.

00:51:09.894 --> 00:51:13.764
Mom, you should go rest. Ji Wan, can you get her bed ready?

00:51:13.894 --> 00:51:15.664
- Okay. - All right, Ji Wan.

00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:17.804
Just get my bed ready, then you get some rest, too.

00:51:18.634 --> 00:51:20.374
I think I'll go to Grandma's room for a minute.

00:51:21.004 --> 00:51:22.874
Mom, why don't you rest first?

00:51:23.504 --> 00:51:27.214
I'll take care of your mom, so you all go get some rest.

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.784
Hey, didn't you say you have to go into work?

00:51:30.184 --> 00:51:32.684
I'll hold down the fort, so don't worry. Just go.

00:51:35.184 --> 00:51:36.854
All right. I'm counting on you.

00:51:38.194 --> 00:51:39.194
I'm heading out now.

00:51:43.894 --> 00:51:46.764
Poor kid. He must be exhausted.

00:52:11.824 --> 00:52:13.194
I still can't believe it.

00:52:14.624 --> 00:52:16.424
That she's gone just like that.

00:52:21.364 --> 00:52:24.104
Mother...

00:52:25.834 --> 00:52:27.534
Because of the lingering effects of the car accident,

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:31.214
I thought it was a blessing you couldn't be at the funeral home.

00:52:33.644 --> 00:52:36.714
I never should have gone shopping with her.

00:52:39.354 --> 00:52:40.884
I'm such a fool.

00:52:43.584 --> 00:52:48.094
Don't think she died in an accident because you two went shopping.

00:52:48.964 --> 00:52:51.394
Think that she gave us what she truly wanted to give...

00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:54.064
before she left us. Okay?

00:52:58.934 --> 00:53:01.004
But she left us so suddenly.

00:53:02.844 --> 00:53:04.674
You can really think of it that way?

00:53:06.244 --> 00:53:07.644
Aren't you resentful?

00:53:10.244 --> 00:53:14.214
When she gave me her first modeling paycheck,

00:53:15.054 --> 00:53:16.054
she said it felt like a spring day.

00:53:18.724 --> 00:53:20.424
So then...

00:53:22.464 --> 00:53:25.594
Why did she have to leave on a spring day of all days?

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:32.734
I'm glad she got to see a spring day before she passed.

00:53:35.274 --> 00:53:36.744
That's enough.

00:53:55.594 --> 00:53:58.034
You just never know when your time is up.

00:54:07.334 --> 00:54:09.074
I have your new work schedule ready for you.

00:54:11.744 --> 00:54:12.744
What?

00:54:22.484 --> 00:54:23.484
Honey.

00:54:24.224 --> 00:54:25.254
I'm off to work.

00:54:25.854 --> 00:54:27.224
Okay. Have a good day.

00:54:40.074 --> 00:54:41.074
Where are you going?

00:54:42.874 --> 00:54:43.874
To my studio.

00:54:45.344 --> 00:54:46.344
Your studio?

00:54:46.644 --> 00:54:49.614
Feel free to drop by whenever. The address is on the invitation.

00:54:54.054 --> 00:54:55.654
And it'd be even better if you brought Dad with you.

00:55:00.124 --> 00:55:02.794
That driver has some nerve, trying to pull a fast one.

00:55:05.464 --> 00:55:07.264
They have no idea who they're dealing with.

00:55:26.514 --> 00:55:27.514
Reporting for duty.

00:55:34.994 --> 00:55:35.994
Let's head to the studio.

00:55:42.334 --> 00:55:44.734
I love the smell of my studio.

00:55:46.404 --> 00:55:48.374
Gosh, you mean the smell of mold?

00:55:48.904 --> 00:55:51.674
It's not like you could air the place out.

00:55:52.314 --> 00:55:54.814
I never thought I'd be back here again.

00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:57.144
This feels so good.

00:55:58.014 --> 00:55:59.014
I'm happy too.

00:55:59.784 --> 00:56:01.754
Hello, my desk. Good to see you again!

00:56:04.124 --> 00:56:07.024
But are you really not scared?

00:56:07.324 --> 00:56:09.794
No. I told you. I've got it all figured out.

00:56:11.194 --> 00:56:12.734
Then tell me the details.

00:56:13.334 --> 00:56:14.804
So I can stop worrying.

00:56:15.464 --> 00:56:16.464
Delivery!

00:56:21.604 --> 00:56:24.974
Pepper spray, a taser,

00:56:25.244 --> 00:56:27.444
and a collapsible baton.

00:56:28.784 --> 00:56:30.914
My gosh, what is all this?

00:56:31.184 --> 00:56:32.284
Our first line of defense.

00:56:35.884 --> 00:56:38.294
We'll be unstoppable with these three.

00:56:39.994 --> 00:56:41.894
I should give Dokgo Chan one of these batons.

00:56:44.224 --> 00:56:45.234
Seriously?

00:56:46.634 --> 00:56:48.464
Everything's about your webtoon with you.

00:56:50.504 --> 00:56:53.874
Yeong Ra, I'll teach you self-defense.

00:56:54.474 --> 00:56:55.504
Self-defense?

00:56:57.674 --> 00:56:59.944
You mean like the kind Dokgo Chan taught So Ri?

00:57:00.114 --> 00:57:03.514
Exactly. If you can master just a few of those moves,

00:57:03.584 --> 00:57:05.884
whether it's a random attacker or some stalker,

00:57:06.284 --> 00:57:07.584
you'll be able to take them down yourself.

00:57:09.784 --> 00:57:11.394
Okay, I'm in. Teach me.

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.124
Okay, I'll start teaching you tomorrow.

00:57:14.254 --> 00:57:15.324
Not tomorrow.

00:57:15.624 --> 00:57:17.564
I'll learn after I'm done with my current series.

00:57:17.994 --> 00:57:19.334
I'm a little behind right now.

00:57:19.934 --> 00:57:20.994
By then...

00:57:21.634 --> 00:57:22.904
I won't have time.

00:57:24.004 --> 00:57:27.234
- Why not? - I have to move on with my life.

00:57:28.004 --> 00:57:31.574
I told you I'd protect you until you finish this series, right?

00:57:32.174 --> 00:57:35.514
And you asked your mom to let you finish this one series.

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:38.514
So after that, my job here is done, isn't it?

00:57:41.114 --> 00:57:42.484
Yes, but...

00:57:44.384 --> 00:57:45.794
So what are you going to do?

00:57:47.894 --> 00:57:48.894
I'm going to...

00:57:52.994 --> 00:57:53.994
This.

00:57:54.234 --> 00:57:55.504
(Bodyguarding, Past Exam Questions Workbook)

00:57:55.564 --> 00:57:56.604
Bodyguarding?

00:57:56.864 --> 00:58:00.434
There's this top security firm in the country.

00:58:00.834 --> 00:58:03.344
I'll get a job there. That's why I'm studying for the certification.

00:58:04.974 --> 00:58:05.974
What about me, then?

00:58:06.314 --> 00:58:09.384
You silly goose. Once that stalker is behind bars,

00:58:09.484 --> 00:58:12.784
- you won't need a bodyguard. - No, that's not what I meant.

00:58:13.814 --> 00:58:15.424
After I finish this series,

00:58:15.824 --> 00:58:18.224
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:58:18.924 --> 00:58:20.724
That's for you to decide.

00:58:21.594 --> 00:58:23.994
You asked your mom to let you finish this series.

00:58:24.594 --> 00:58:25.664
Doesn't that mean...

00:58:25.994 --> 00:58:27.834
you don't plan to continue as a webtoon artist?

00:58:29.264 --> 00:58:30.334
That's...

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:34.274
I said that because I thought I couldn't be a webtoon artist.

00:58:35.344 --> 00:58:37.144
Dad would obviously be against it anyway.

00:58:38.104 --> 00:58:39.144
Right.

00:58:39.514 --> 00:58:41.144
If it's too hard to go against your dad's wishes,

00:58:41.714 --> 00:58:43.444
then maybe you should just do what he says this time.

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:45.914
Ji Wan.

00:58:46.514 --> 00:58:48.284
Why are you talking to me like we're strangers?

00:58:50.154 --> 00:58:53.224
In your life, everyone but you is a stranger.

00:58:53.654 --> 00:58:55.964
And in my life, everyone but me is a stranger.

(Jamun Medical Devices)

00:59:04.234 --> 00:59:05.304
Welcome.

00:59:05.804 --> 00:59:07.104
Can I look around?

00:59:07.504 --> 00:59:08.504
Of course.

00:59:09.174 --> 00:59:11.974
Would you like a brochure to start? Yes, right this way.

00:59:15.944 --> 00:59:17.444
You can look over this for now.

00:59:17.784 --> 00:59:19.484
- Thank you. - Hello...

00:59:21.014 --> 00:59:22.024
Ji Hyuk.

00:59:22.784 --> 00:59:23.784
Mom.

00:59:24.754 --> 00:59:26.194
What are you doing here?

00:59:27.024 --> 00:59:29.164
I thought we could go home a little early today.

00:59:29.794 --> 00:59:31.864
How are you feeling, Mom?

00:59:33.134 --> 00:59:36.004
I'm fine. It's your father I'm worried about.

00:59:36.804 --> 00:59:39.704
What's wrong with Dad? Is he sick?

00:59:40.334 --> 00:59:42.004
He's just been lying in bed all day.

00:59:42.974 --> 00:59:46.844
I prepared the sauce for his noodles and just told Su Bin to boil them,

00:59:47.174 --> 00:59:48.784
but I heard he barely ate.

00:59:49.814 --> 00:59:51.584
He's still taking Grandma's death really hard.

00:59:53.814 --> 00:59:55.724
It's more than that. He's been strong for the family,

00:59:55.984 --> 00:59:57.524
and Grandma was a huge source of his strength.

00:59:58.994 --> 01:00:00.654
But now that she's gone,

01:00:01.424 --> 01:00:02.694
the burden he's carried since leaving his job...

01:00:02.694 --> 01:00:03.964
has finally crushed him.

01:00:05.094 --> 01:00:06.094
I guess so.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:11.164
In that case, should we pick up his favorite jokbal?

01:00:12.604 --> 01:00:13.634
Should we do that?

01:00:17.304 --> 01:00:18.314
Mom.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:20.074
Where's Dad?

01:00:20.614 --> 01:00:22.044
He's still not awake.

01:00:22.414 --> 01:00:24.714
What? He's still sleeping?

01:00:26.114 --> 01:00:28.524
I've never seen him like this in my entire life.

01:00:33.124 --> 01:00:35.064
- I'm home. - Hey.

01:00:37.264 --> 01:00:38.264
Dad.

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.804
- Where are you going? - To the bathroom.

01:00:42.634 --> 01:00:45.974
Dad, I got jokbal from your favorite place.

01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:49.144
You and your mom enjoy it. I don't have an appetite.

01:00:49.304 --> 01:00:50.604
Dad, then how about...

01:00:50.944 --> 01:00:53.374
we grab a drink together at Uncle Yeong Bo's diner?

01:00:54.114 --> 01:00:55.384
No, I'm good.

01:01:05.694 --> 01:01:07.394
When did my dad get so old?

01:01:16.764 --> 01:01:18.974
It wasn't easy getting your number, Ji Hyuk.

01:01:19.374 --> 01:01:20.504
This is Jung Bo A.

01:01:21.374 --> 01:01:22.744
I'm back in Korea.

01:01:23.274 --> 01:01:26.114
I'm texting because I have something to say in person.

01:01:27.174 --> 01:01:29.714
I'm actually in your neighborhood right now.

01:01:30.584 --> 01:01:32.054
It's okay even if it's late.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.154
Come to the cafe down the street.

01:01:37.884 --> 01:01:40.424
If you can't make it today, I'll wait for you tomorrow.

01:01:42.794 --> 01:01:44.594
I'll keep waiting until you agree to meet me.

01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:48.234
She's crazy. What is this about?

01:01:57.244 --> 01:01:58.344
What is this all about?

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:02.884
- I'm sorry. Please, sit. - I'm not staying. What do you want?

01:02:03.514 --> 01:02:05.184
You've got some nerve, Jung Bo A.

01:02:06.114 --> 01:02:09.084
Why were you so insistent on meeting when I told you to just text me?

01:02:10.684 --> 01:02:11.754
Well...

01:02:12.454 --> 01:02:14.654
I came because my conscience wouldn't let me rest.

01:02:15.094 --> 01:02:16.094
Your conscience?

01:02:17.224 --> 01:02:19.394
I am so sorry.

01:02:19.964 --> 01:02:21.064
I'm really sorry.

01:02:21.594 --> 01:02:22.934
This was all in the past.

01:02:23.464 --> 01:02:25.034
Why would you show up now and act like this?

01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:29.074
I didn't know my father was capable of that.

01:02:30.174 --> 01:02:32.844
That he would do something like that to your parents...

01:02:32.914 --> 01:02:35.544
I never would have imagined it in my wildest dreams.

01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:38.854
Something like what?

01:02:40.254 --> 01:02:41.924
I didn't know what was going on when I told you...

01:02:42.424 --> 01:02:45.554
to get a big settlement from us. But forget a settlement.

01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:47.754
After my father did something so disrespectful,

01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:49.824
why didn't you tell me?

01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:51.864
What are you talking about?

01:02:52.494 --> 01:02:53.734
What? Just tell me.

01:02:55.264 --> 01:02:56.264
Wait, don't tell me...

01:02:56.904 --> 01:02:58.204
You really don't know?

01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:47.884
Dad.

01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:52.454
I was wrong.

01:03:55.694 --> 01:03:57.124
I was so completely wrong.

01:04:00.234 --> 01:04:01.334
I am so sorry.

01:04:49.784 --> 01:04:52.614
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:52.954 --> 01:04:55.854
What a clueless fool. Those two are headed for trouble.

01:04:55.924 --> 01:04:57.584
I offered her a million dollars, and she just snatched it up.

01:04:57.654 --> 01:04:59.524
Eun Oh really took the money?

01:04:59.794 --> 01:05:02.164
How was I supposed to tell you that they humiliated me?

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.294
How was I supposed to bring it up?

01:05:03.364 --> 01:05:06.364
You were bound to be hurt even more. You foolish kid.

01:05:06.734 --> 01:05:07.994
You think you're so smart, don't you?

01:05:08.034 --> 01:05:12.004
Park Seong Jae, what are you doing? Hold on, how... And since when?

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.304
You're divorced!

01:05:14.104 --> 01:05:16.104
Eun Oh, I really think...

01:05:16.504 --> 01:05:17.944
you're the only one for me, for as long as I live.

01:05:18.004 --> 01:05:21.244
You know why I'm here. You're just going to ruin my son.

01:05:21.344 --> 01:05:25.014
And it won't just be you. Your family will be in danger, too.
