HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.133
ROAD WORK, DETOUR

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:34.569
Take it.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.034
Motherfucker.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:43.870
Don't you know how to say thank you?

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.456
Damn kid.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.249
You don't know how to be grateful.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.835
Have you ever seen a boss like me?

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:52.503
I bought you breakfast

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.506
and picked you up for work.

00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:00.553
Fine. Whatever.

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.641
Didn't you say the roadwork here
would end last week?

00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:07.477
Why is it still happening?

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:10.063
How long will you be working here?

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:15.651
Hey, do you have the energy
to work for me after a whole night shift?

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:20.073
Here you go again.

00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:23.159
You really just ignore me when I talk.

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:28.373
How sad.

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:33.294
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:47.850
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:57.235
Hey, Mr. Chang.
It's Mighty Good Cleaning Services.

00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:59.070
Our cleaning is mighty good.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:00.446
You're at the door?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.906
Okay, we'll be right there.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:04.117
Just a moment, please. Thank you.

00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:12.166
Hey, this isn't enough. Grab some more.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:15.545
THIS WAY

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:49.370
Hey, I'll do it.

00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:50.705
Work on that over there.

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:54.560
I just heard from the building manager
that the previous tenant here

00:06:54.644 --> 00:06:56.145
was a professor at NTU.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.857
I heard that he was very frugal.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.401
He had tens of millions in savings.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.572
But what's the point
of saving all that money?

00:07:07.198 --> 00:07:08.115
Look.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:10.910
He lived here all alone.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.704
No wife, no kids, and no one to rely on.

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:16.541
Nobody knew he was dead
for nearly a month.

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:23.381
Here's some real talk.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:25.758
Change your personality a bit.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.178
At least respond when people talk to you.

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:31.597
You are now listening…

00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:35.726
Or you'll end up with no friends.
Maybe no one'll even know your name.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.186
Rumor has it

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.730
that Mahler didn't finish this symphony

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:43.234
because of a mysterious death curse.

00:07:49.198 --> 00:07:52.076
Li Jen-yao,
you should be called Loner-yao.

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:55.663
Fans of classical music spread the rumor

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.164
that the ninth symphony

00:07:57.248 --> 00:07:59.792
is a death curse

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:02.712
because many famous composers

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:08.009
happened to die soon after
finishing their ninth symphonies.

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:44.503
Thank you for tuning in today.

00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:46.255
I am Hsia Tien-ching.

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.090
See you next week at the same time.

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:00.186
2-2-7-0-0.

00:09:07.652 --> 00:09:09.403
Are you focusing on your homework?

00:09:09.487 --> 00:09:10.488
Yes.

00:09:10.571 --> 00:09:12.573
-Then let me quiz you.
-Okay.

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:14.742
What is five times seven?

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:19.664
Thirty-five.

00:09:21.874 --> 00:09:22.833
Good job.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.047
Daddy is back!

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.507
Hey, what did I say?

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.342
Wait until the car stops.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:32.843
-Okay.
-Hey!

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:34.053
Kidney Bean!

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:36.722
-I've missed you!
-Daddy!

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.309
I've missed you so much.

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:43.187
-Why are you back so late today?
-The last job was tough.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.897
It took a long time to clean.

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:48.442
Loner-yao, do that tomorrow. Let's eat.

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.444
You guys go ahead.

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:51.737
I'm going home to rest.

00:09:54.657 --> 00:09:55.991
He's hard to get along with.

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:44.123
PAY ENVELOPE

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:13.986
Do you remember the last time

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:15.529
you made a wish?

00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:19.658
Did your wish come true?

00:11:21.076 --> 00:11:22.077
Before I got sick…

00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:22.995
RISING RADIO

00:11:23.078 --> 00:11:24.038
…I was always impatient

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.040
and eager to go.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.460
I couldn't even wait
for my wishes to come true.

00:11:30.044 --> 00:11:32.254
Rather than make wishes, I preferred

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:36.175
to set a lot of goals for myself.

00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:38.677
I prepared a notebook for myself.

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:42.848
If there was anything I wanted to do,
I'd write it down.

00:11:45.017 --> 00:11:46.602
I remember in those days,

00:11:46.685 --> 00:11:48.729
the first thing I did when I woke up

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.440
was open this notebook

00:11:52.066 --> 00:11:54.401
and see what was left to do.

00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:59.073
If I wrote down something I wanted to buy,

00:11:59.156 --> 00:12:02.743
I'd start thinking of ways
to work and save up for it.

00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:05.371
If I wrote down something I wanted to do,

00:12:05.454 --> 00:12:07.456
I'd make a plan right away

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.209
and see how I could achieve it
as soon as possible.

00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.922
That was until the summer
of my second year in high school.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.007
I got sick.

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:21.303
My vision suddenly declined.

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:24.098
In less than a few months,

00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:27.518
the words I'd written in that notebook

00:12:28.185 --> 00:12:29.311
were no longer visible to me.

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:35.943
Those goals that I was so eager to achieve

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:38.320
all became

00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:43.117
wishes that might come true
someday in the future.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.830
I remember the last wish
I wrote down in the notebook.

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:50.791
It was also the first wish I fulfilled

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.877
after losing my sight.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.546
It was to become a radio DJ.

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.300
Coming up next

00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:01.218
is the first piece I played

00:13:01.302 --> 00:13:03.178
after becoming a radio DJ,

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:07.349
a piano trio of Johann Pachelbel's Canon.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.545
Excuse me.

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:03.757
Could you check
the expiration date on this for me?

00:15:04.758 --> 00:15:06.719
This expires on the 29th.

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:08.762
Thank you.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.527
Hey, watch out.

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:17.414
Are you…

00:16:23.128 --> 00:16:25.631
the man who took me to the radio station

00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:28.634
when I was lost last time?

00:16:29.593 --> 00:16:31.095
I was just passing by

00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:33.764
and saw you almost bump into something.

00:16:34.807 --> 00:16:35.933
So I warned you.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.269
Thank you.

00:16:40.437 --> 00:16:42.022
-How come you--
-Previously…

00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:44.733
-Sorry, you were--
-Sorry, you first.

00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:55.536
It's okay.

00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:57.996
Go ahead.

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.209
I was going to ask

00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:03.794
if you had…

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:24.064
Do you want to have dinner together?

00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:39.204
Do you eat here often?

00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:40.622
Yes.

00:17:41.748 --> 00:17:44.418
This is the best place I know of nearby.

00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:47.129
They're better known for their pork ribs,

00:17:47.212 --> 00:17:49.590
but I prefer
their chicken drumsticks with rice.

00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:03.353
Can I ask you a question?

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:07.691
Do we know each other?

00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:12.029
I know it's a bit strange to ask this.

00:18:12.738 --> 00:18:14.239
But for some reason,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.825
from the first time we met,

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:18.076
your voice

00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:20.746
sounded familiar to me.

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:24.583
It was as if we'd known each other
for a long time.

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:33.592
I don't think

00:18:34.343 --> 00:18:35.302
we know each other.

00:18:37.763 --> 00:18:38.847
That figures.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:41.016
I thought so.

00:18:49.274 --> 00:18:50.609
Can I ask you a question?

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.570
Sure.

00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:55.322
About

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.908
the tattoo on your hand.

00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:03.956
A friend of mine has a butterfly tattoo
just like yours in the same spot.

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.124
So every time I see it,

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:08.043
I want to ask

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:10.671
why you chose that design.

00:19:13.382 --> 00:19:14.758
Honestly,

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.095
I don't know why I have this tattoo.

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:20.472
In fact, it's not just you.

00:19:20.973 --> 00:19:22.557
Many people have asked me this.

00:19:22.641 --> 00:19:24.559
I never know how to answer

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.563
because I don't remember
ever getting a tattoo.

00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:31.525
I have no idea
what this tattoo looks like.

00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:39.241
Do you not believe me?

00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:43.578
No.

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:46.123
I believe you. It's just…

00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:49.251
I was kidding.

00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:57.801
I got this tattoo with a friend.

00:19:57.884 --> 00:19:59.303
There's no special meaning.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.357
So

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.527
will we see each other again?

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:28.332
Taxi's here.

00:20:32.711 --> 00:20:34.004
Be careful.

00:20:40.719 --> 00:20:42.637
I've written down
the taxi's license plate number.

00:20:43.138 --> 00:20:45.265
Let me know when you're home.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:47.267
Wait.

00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:49.186
I don't have your number.

00:20:49.686 --> 00:20:51.646
Can I have it?
I'll call you when I'm home.

00:20:57.778 --> 00:20:58.945
Contacts.

00:20:59.488 --> 00:21:01.031
Add. Press.

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:03.533
Add phone number.

00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:04.451
Finish.

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:05.369
It's done.

00:21:07.204 --> 00:21:09.373
Don't forget your things.
They're on your left.

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:11.375
I'm closing the door.

00:21:34.064 --> 00:21:36.775
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.611
Number 38.

00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:44.157
Look. Our little girl's legs
are pretty long, don't you think?

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:47.077
She's going to be a leggy girl.

00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:50.789
What are we going to do?

00:21:50.872 --> 00:21:52.582
Calm down.

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:15.772
Stop telling me to calm down, okay?

00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.858
You're her mother. You have to be strong.

00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:20.402
She was violated so badly.

00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:22.612
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:22:22.696 --> 00:22:24.823
…you're upset, but you have to be strong.

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.785
If it were possible,

00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:31.621
I really wish
those people would go to hell.

00:24:01.753 --> 00:24:03.213
Ms. Chou, are you here?

00:24:04.047 --> 00:24:06.967
Yes, I finished cleaning
and had a bit of time.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.469
I thought I would cook something for you.

00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:19.187
It smells so good.
Did you make sesame oil chicken?

00:24:19.896 --> 00:24:21.273
You have a keen nose.

00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:22.607
Yeah.

00:24:22.691 --> 00:24:24.776
Your sesame oil chicken is my favorite.

00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:27.529
My daughter loves it too.

00:24:27.612 --> 00:24:30.282
Whenever winter comes around,
I make her a bowl of it.

00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:31.658
Let me get you some.

00:24:32.158 --> 00:24:33.243
It's okay.

00:24:33.326 --> 00:24:35.453
I just ate with a friend.

00:24:36.037 --> 00:24:39.207
Why don't you put it in the fridge?
I'll heat it up later.

00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.125
Okay.

00:24:41.626 --> 00:24:43.670
I'm going to call my friend.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.103
00:02.

00:25:02.397 --> 00:25:04.482
Phone. Contacts.

00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:07.027
Li Jen-yao.

00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.529
Li Jen-yao.

00:25:19.873 --> 00:25:24.085
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.
Charges will apply after the beep.

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:28.923
Press pound after the tone
to leave a message, or simply hang up.

00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:32.594
End. Press.

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:40.727
So you really haven't heard anything
about Chiang Hsiao-tung lately?

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.312
No, seriously.

00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:43.938
Why would I lie to you?

00:25:44.022 --> 00:25:46.691
It's not like we just met.

00:25:46.775 --> 00:25:48.860
If I'd really heard anything about her,

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:51.154
wouldn't I tell you right away?

00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:54.908
Hey.

00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:56.618
What's up with you?

00:25:57.202 --> 00:25:59.287
Why suddenly ask about your girlfriend?

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.499
I…

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:07.337
I recently… met someone
who's a lot like her.

00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:10.715
What?

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.344
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:15.261
Not important.

00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:23.603
Okay, students, pay attention.

00:26:26.147 --> 00:26:27.565
-Sir, you're awesome!
-Amazing!

00:26:27.649 --> 00:26:29.651
Sir, do it again! My turn!

00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:31.653
My turn!

00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:35.407
Okay, I want to tell all the girls here

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.576
that self-defense is mainly
for protecting yourself,

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.828
not hurting others.

00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:43.206
But I'd rather you take precautions
than put yourself in danger.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.669
Do your best
to avoid situations that might be unsafe.

00:26:47.752 --> 00:26:48.628
Also,

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:50.755
when you're around boys,

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:52.590
no matter how well you know them,

00:26:52.674 --> 00:26:55.343
you should maintain
a basic level of awareness.

00:26:55.427 --> 00:26:56.261
Understand?

00:26:56.344 --> 00:26:57.887
Yes.

00:26:57.971 --> 00:27:00.432
Good. That's all
for today's self-defense lecture.

00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:03.560
-Dismissed.
-Thank you, sir.

00:27:03.643 --> 00:27:04.644
He's so handsome.

00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:05.854
So good-looking.

00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:08.064
Hello? It's me.

00:27:08.898 --> 00:27:10.567
Yes, I was in class and couldn't answer.

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:12.068
What's up?

00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:18.992
Shit, you're getting married? Seriously?

00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:21.161
LIN'S EATERY

00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:22.078
Hey, Che-li.

00:27:22.871 --> 00:27:25.123
Besides inviting Meng-hung
and me to your wedding,

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:26.249
did you invite

00:27:26.916 --> 00:27:28.209
Ouyang and Yu-hsiang?

00:27:31.546 --> 00:27:34.090
I… probably won't.

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:38.720
I've only stayed in touch
with you two after high school.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.472
Inviting them now

00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:43.266
would feel like I'm only doing it
for their cash gifts.

00:27:44.976 --> 00:27:45.977
Fuck.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.897
The last time I saw them
was at Yu-hsiang's wedding.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.192
We hadn't talked in so long
that it felt like he just wanted my money.

00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:56.321
You talk to them, right?

00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:57.363
How are they?

00:27:58.865 --> 00:27:59.824
Don't mention it.

00:27:59.908 --> 00:28:02.368
They're still doing something shady.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:05.789
Earlier, Fan Wei-ting said
he'd count me in,

00:28:05.872 --> 00:28:08.666
that I'd make good money,
at least 100,000 a month.

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.045
Hey, don't you dare. You're a teacher now.

00:28:12.128 --> 00:28:13.880
Don't do stuff like that with them.

00:28:15.673 --> 00:28:18.468
Do you guys know
where Chiang Hsiao-tung ended up?

00:28:22.138 --> 00:28:23.765
I heard she committed suicide.

00:28:24.474 --> 00:28:25.391
Is that true?

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:26.768
Fuck, why bring that up now?

00:28:30.897 --> 00:28:32.690
To be honest, I often think about her.

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:35.068
Sometimes, I even dream about her.

00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:37.862
When I went with my wife
to her prenatal checkup,

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:41.074
I thought I saw her.

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:44.452
To this day, I don't understand

00:28:45.078 --> 00:28:47.914
how we could've done
such a horrible thing.

00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:49.123
What's wrong with you?

00:28:50.124 --> 00:28:51.543
You're getting married.

00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:52.752
Why bring her up?

00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:54.838
Don't go looking for trouble, all right?

00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:56.673
Her family accepted the money.

00:28:56.756 --> 00:28:58.007
You know what that means?

00:28:58.091 --> 00:29:00.677
It means that it ended then and there.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.387
It's all in the past.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.097
If it's really in the past,

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:07.642
when I mentioned her name just now,

00:29:09.477 --> 00:29:10.562
why were you so scared?

00:29:12.063 --> 00:29:13.273
Fuck!

00:29:13.356 --> 00:29:15.316
What happens after you find her?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.402
What do you want to do?

00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:20.822
I want to tell her in person…

00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:24.284
that I'm sorry.

00:29:25.076 --> 00:29:27.078
You've fucking lost your mind,
haven't you?

00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:30.456
Do you know how many years
I've slaved away to get my current job?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.251
How many people
I've begged and been at the mercy of?

00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.461
If you feel guilty and can't live with it,

00:29:35.962 --> 00:29:37.088
that's your business.

00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:38.798
Just go to hell.

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:40.091
Don't get me involved!

00:29:40.174 --> 00:29:42.802
All right, Jung-tai.
Let's just talk. Calm down.

00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:50.018
Sorry.

00:29:50.935 --> 00:29:52.395
I can't make it to your wedding.

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:53.980
Here's your gift.

00:29:54.564 --> 00:29:57.275
If anything ever happens to you,
don't fucking call me.

00:30:01.362 --> 00:30:04.407
LIN'S EATERY

00:30:27.013 --> 00:30:29.682
TIEN-CHING: SORRY, MY TYPING IS A BIT SLOW

00:30:39.776 --> 00:30:40.610
THAT'S OKAY

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:49.702
THAT'S OKAY, I'M SLOW TOO

00:30:51.287 --> 00:30:52.205
Li Jen-yao.

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:54.248
That's okay. I'm slow too.

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:56.125
21:44.

00:31:13.101 --> 00:31:15.353
Text field. Editing.

00:31:15.436 --> 00:31:16.562
Are you busy?

00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:18.648
Send. Press.

00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:20.692
Message sent.

00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:23.027
Are you busy?

00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:24.612
RISING RADIO

00:31:28.658 --> 00:31:29.742
Li Jen-yao.

00:31:34.247 --> 00:31:35.748
Swipe to answer.

00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:41.045
Hello?

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.464
Hello? It's me.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:48.886
Do you usually work this late?

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.722
Yes, I just got home.

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:51.848
No wonder.

00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:56.269
Every time I'm on the phone with you,
you sound exhausted.

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:01.315
Have you had dinner?

00:32:02.942 --> 00:32:04.068
Yes.

00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:05.570
I live alone.

00:32:06.904 --> 00:32:10.116
Actually, it's not as inconvenient
as I thought.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.993
I did hire a helper.

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:14.662
She comes by every week
to help me clean and cook.

00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:15.663
LI JEN-YAO

00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:17.582
Her sesame oil chicken is delicious.

00:32:25.923 --> 00:32:29.010
We've been chatting like this
for a long time.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.678
Has it been

00:32:31.304 --> 00:32:32.555
half a month?

00:32:35.224 --> 00:32:36.309
I think so.

00:32:38.978 --> 00:32:40.438
At first, I thought

00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.982
you wouldn't keep calling me like this.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:45.026
Why?

00:32:46.527 --> 00:32:50.364
Because ever since losing my sight,
I care a lot about what others think.

00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:51.574
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:53.242
And I don't want to burden others.

00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:58.247
I also try very hard
to prove that blindness isn't pitiful.

00:32:58.748 --> 00:33:00.583
It's just a little inconvenient.

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:05.505
So I try to appear cheerful.

00:33:10.593 --> 00:33:12.678
When I first joined the radio station,

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:15.723
my colleague was kind enough
to set me up with someone.

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:20.394
I guess this person
was attracted only to my cheerful side.

00:33:22.105 --> 00:33:24.816
So our relationship gradually changed.

00:33:26.776 --> 00:33:28.194
What made me different

00:33:28.694 --> 00:33:30.238
didn't make me unique.

00:33:31.656 --> 00:33:33.116
Rather, it was a sort of pressure.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.662
At the time, I only saw him as a friend.

00:33:41.165 --> 00:33:44.293
But sometimes when I think about it,
I still feel pretty sad.

00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:49.674
Actually,

00:33:50.925 --> 00:33:54.137
I don't know why
I'm telling you these things.

00:33:58.349 --> 00:33:59.725
I want you to know…

00:34:01.727 --> 00:34:02.562
I'm glad

00:34:04.522 --> 00:34:07.191
that we can keep talking like this.

00:34:17.827 --> 00:34:18.744
Well,

00:34:19.662 --> 00:34:21.122
are you free on Friday?

00:34:21.747 --> 00:34:22.665
Let's meet up.

00:34:29.463 --> 00:34:30.673
Sure.

00:34:34.177 --> 00:34:35.887
I'll set up a time with you later.

00:34:43.895 --> 00:34:45.188
I'm going to hang up now.

00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:52.278
End. Press.

00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:05.958
Who is it?

00:35:06.542 --> 00:35:08.169
Who else can it be?

00:35:10.254 --> 00:35:11.547
Of course it's me.

00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:14.133
The cute Ms. Chi-chi!

00:35:15.176 --> 00:35:16.052
I knew it was you.

00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:20.097
My mom went out with her boyfriend
and abandoned me.

00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:22.642
Can you take me in? Just for one night.

00:35:22.725 --> 00:35:24.185
Okay, I'll get a blanket for you.

00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:26.604
I knew you were the best, Tien-ching!

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.028
Good thing I have you,
or else I'd be doomed.

00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:58.302
LI JEN-YAO: THAT'S OKAY, I'M SLOW TOO

00:36:06.018 --> 00:36:07.311
MIGHTY GOOD CLEANING SERVICES

00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:13.526
Hey, Loner-yao. Wanna grab a drink later?

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:14.610
I'm busy.

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:16.487
Busy?

00:36:17.113 --> 00:36:19.573
Oh, I know. I saw you
took a shower at the office.

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:23.077
Damn, you smell so fresh.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.246
Fuck, you used my shower gel, didn't you?

00:36:25.329 --> 00:36:26.372
Meeting a girl?

00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:28.624
Why else would you shower first? Hey.

00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:31.210
Hold up. Tell me or I won't let you go.

00:36:31.794 --> 00:36:33.963
You said you met
someone like Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:35.214
Alike in what way?

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.092
Hair? Eyes? Nose? Ears?

00:36:38.926 --> 00:36:39.969
Tell me.

00:36:41.095 --> 00:36:42.305
They don't look alike.

00:36:43.055 --> 00:36:44.307
But they have the same tattoo.

00:36:49.228 --> 00:36:50.813
It's getting late. I'm leaving.

00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:02.366
Hey, honey.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.744
How are you? Still feeling sick today?

00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:06.370
No, I feel great today.

00:37:06.454 --> 00:37:09.332
Are any of your high school classmates
attending our wedding?

00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:10.916
Is the number confirmed?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.168
I need to know.

00:37:12.251 --> 00:37:14.337
My high school classmates?

00:37:15.629 --> 00:37:16.797
Some live too far away.

00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:18.507
Some are busy and can't make it.

00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:21.385
Hold those spots for my college friends.

00:37:22.386 --> 00:37:24.680
Honey, I'm busy right now.

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:25.765
Let's talk later.

00:37:25.848 --> 00:37:26.724
Okay.

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:27.641
Okay, bye.

00:37:38.986 --> 00:37:40.488
SEARCH OR INPUT WEB ADDRESS

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.701
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

00:37:49.288 --> 00:37:51.749
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

00:38:10.643 --> 00:38:12.436
PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO FIND SOMEONE

00:38:34.208 --> 00:38:35.418
Sorry, I'm late.

00:38:36.043 --> 00:38:38.129
No, you're not late.

00:38:38.212 --> 00:38:39.213
I was early.

00:38:40.047 --> 00:38:43.342
I like to be early
when I'm meeting someone.

00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:46.804
That lipstick

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.473
looks nice on you today.

00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:52.184
My colleague applied it for me.

00:38:52.268 --> 00:38:54.270
She said I'd look better this way.

00:38:59.817 --> 00:39:01.068
So,

00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:03.154
for today,

00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:04.613
where are we going?

00:39:05.823 --> 00:39:07.283
It's a bit far from here.

00:39:07.825 --> 00:39:09.452
Not somewhere you're familiar with.

00:39:11.078 --> 00:39:12.204
Do you have your cane?

00:39:13.247 --> 00:39:14.206
It's okay.

00:39:14.707 --> 00:39:16.083
Just walk next to me

00:39:16.584 --> 00:39:18.627
and let me put my hand on your shoulder.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:34.059
Let's go this way.

00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:56.475
Are you nervous?

00:40:58.143 --> 00:40:59.520
I'm not nervous.

00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:00.688
I just…

00:41:02.273 --> 00:41:03.482
I don't know what to do.

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:08.362
Since I can't see your expression,

00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:10.364
I don't know what you are thinking.

00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:11.782
I'm afraid

00:41:12.283 --> 00:41:14.285
you'll get bored being with me

00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:16.495
or feel awkward.

00:41:18.122 --> 00:41:20.624
The thought of that
makes me a bit anxious.

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:30.259
I'm… not good at conversation.

00:41:31.677 --> 00:41:33.095
Right now,

00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:35.222
I really don't know what to say.

00:41:37.182 --> 00:41:38.058
But

00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:40.728
hanging out with you today…

00:41:43.105 --> 00:41:44.440
makes me very happy.

00:41:47.943 --> 00:41:48.944
Really?

00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:50.195
Yes.

00:41:56.619 --> 00:41:57.536
Well,

00:41:59.288 --> 00:42:02.124
can you send me a selfie?

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.753
Sure.

00:42:07.004 --> 00:42:10.758
But what do you want my selfie for?

00:42:12.134 --> 00:42:15.346
I want to see
if you look just like I imagined.

00:42:18.098 --> 00:42:20.059
But you…

00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:23.812
Are you wondering
how I can see with my eyes like this?

00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:29.943
Actually, my vision right now feels like

00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:33.447
having foggy glasses while eating noodles.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.659
But at certain angles
or under certain lighting,

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:39.495
I can see what you look like just fine.

00:42:44.249 --> 00:42:46.043
Okay. Give me a moment.

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:53.884
I think I dropped my phone.

00:42:53.967 --> 00:42:55.636
Wait here for me.

00:42:56.136 --> 00:42:57.846
Let me go back and look for it.

00:43:47.896 --> 00:43:50.691
Are you Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:38.989
X-NO HIGH SCHOOL BALLERINA'S
LEAKED ORGY VIDEO

00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:44.745
Let's meet our first lucky listener.

00:44:44.828 --> 00:44:47.289
Could you introduce yourself?

00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:51.001
Hi, everyone. My name is Hsia Tien-ching.

00:44:52.044 --> 00:44:55.506
My dream is to become a radio DJ.

00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:56.799
It's okay.

00:44:56.882 --> 00:44:58.050
Why?

00:44:58.133 --> 00:45:00.093
You're safe here.

00:45:00.594 --> 00:45:02.554
I'll protect you.

00:45:03.055 --> 00:45:05.182
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

00:45:05.933 --> 00:45:09.770
Since my illness started in high school,
my vision has dropped to 0.01.

00:45:11.146 --> 00:45:14.274
Now all I can see are blurry silhouettes.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.069
I can barely see colors.

00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:19.279
So, compared to watching TV,

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.573
I prefer listening to the radio.

00:52:47.519 --> 00:52:52.524
