WEBVTT

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:09.154
(Moon River)

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:10.485
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.785
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.895
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.865
This is a rare tea, a gift from my father.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.405
Royal Mother!

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:28.775
Royal Mother!

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:31.405
Is anyone out there? Summon the Royal Physician now!

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:32.905
Royal Mother!

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.615
The traitor, Crown Princess Gang...

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:42.815
who assassinated the Queen, is to be deposed...

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.555
and demoted to the status of a commoner.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:51.365
So, Your Highness,

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:57.605
you must not be swayed by pity or curiosity.

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:02.175
What do you mean by that?

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.375
You have a long and an arduous road ahead.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:08.815
Take care on your journey.

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:30.235
Why are you here?

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:32.035
Because I missed you.

00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:35.535
I no longer wish to see you, Your Royal Highness.

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.445
I despise the royals that killed mine, the palace,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.375
and you, Your Royal Highness, who will become its master.

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:44.615
So,

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:46.785
never come here again.

00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:58.725
Do you really mean that?

00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:06.105
I do.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:09.605
Then I will give it all up.

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:14.615
Yes.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:17.545
That is a wise decision.

00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:21.585
This worthless title of Crown Prince...

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:25.325
I have no desire or ambition for it whatsoever.

00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:29.695
If there is one thing I have ever truly desired,

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:33.865
it is you and you alone.

00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:37.035
So please,

00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.605
you must remain my heart's one desire.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.205
Please...

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.115
do not abandon me.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:51.615
Yeon Wol.

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.155
Please leave.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.055
No!

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:05.295
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:07.695
We will, no matter what,

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:10.635
be together!

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:21.975
I am told you are looking after the Crown Princess.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:23.414
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:26.085
She is a traitor who killed the Queen.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.455
By taking care of a criminal like her,

00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:31.585
you could lose your life as well. Do you know that?

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:33.325
I do not care.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:35.795
I made a promise to protect Her Highness...

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:38.525
to her older brother.

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:46.135
In two days,

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:48.675
the Crown Princess will be...

00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:53.245
sentenced to death by poison in the late afternoon by my command.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:57.245
Why are you telling me this?

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:04.685
Deliver this letter to the Crown Princess.

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:26.975
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:30.785
This is a letter from His Majesty.

00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:42.555
A Crown Prince has but two paths in life.

00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:46.165
To ascend the throne, or to die.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.235
The Crown Prince plans to abandon everything to run away with you.

00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:53.035
So, for the Prince's sake, you must let the world believe you are dead.

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:57.845
Go far away, and live the rest of your life as if you were dead.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.215
His Majesty will sentence you to death by poison.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.685
You must flee at once, Your Highness.

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:08.085
Why would I run away?

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:10.455
I am innocent.

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:15.825
If I run, it will be an admission that I killed the Royal Mother.

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:17.225
But...

00:05:18.065 --> 00:05:19.125
I did not.

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:21.495
I know.

00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:25.705
But who is going to believe you now?

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:31.775
If I run away,

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:38.285
His Royal Highness will stop at nothing to find me.

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:44.855
A Crown Prince looking for the wife who assassinated his own mother.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:49.825
How could he possibly survive?

00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:54.335
Your Highness.

00:05:55.465 --> 00:05:58.565
For now, just think about yourself.

00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:10.115
Fine.

00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:12.445
I will think only of myself.

00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:16.655
Can you arrange where I will go...

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.185
and how I will get there?

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:20.925
Yes, Your Highness.

00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:54.925
As long as His Royal Highness is safe, I can be at peace.

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:09.535
Who are you?

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:11.004
You fell into the water,

00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:12.775
and it seems you have lost your memory.

00:07:13.305 --> 00:07:15.015
Your name is Park Dal,

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:17.315
and I am your aunt.

00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:20.215
Park...

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:22.585
Dal...

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:25.355
That is me.

00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:30.995
Hong Nan...

00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:37.165
Why did you deceive me?

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:40.235
Why would you do that?

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:44.605
Wait.

00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:47.975
Go get my brother and his wife.

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:50.075
Hurry! Go get them!

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:51.885
Okay.

00:08:16.035 --> 00:08:17.105
Have your memories...

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:20.775
returned?

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:24.885
In bits and pieces...

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:28.085
Just fragments.

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:31.825
So does that mean...

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:36.125
I am really Gang Yeon Wol?

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:37.765
Yes.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.235
I know you are confused,

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:44.265
but you must accept it, Your Highness.

00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:47.305
It is not about whether I accept it or not.

00:08:48.505 --> 00:08:52.045
In the memories of Park Dal that you told me about five years ago,

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:55.575
I do not recognise a single face,

00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:01.685
But the faces in the memories flooding back to me are so vivid.

00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:04.855
I know that these are my real memories,

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:07.225
and that I...

00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:09.795
am Gang Yeon Wol.

00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:12.695
My head gets that,

00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:16.464
but those are just memories.

00:09:16.465 --> 00:09:18.705
I have been Park Dal my whole life.

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:21.905
I am so confused. I cannot tell what is real anymore.

00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:28.415
Your Highness, of course you are confused.

00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:30.575
But we are out of time.

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:33.215
You have to run.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:36.615
Run? What do you mean?

00:09:36.855 --> 00:09:41.055
His Majesty plans to have you declared dead again.

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.295
Declared dead?

00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:47.365
He is going to set fire to the royal quarters...

00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:51.705
and prepare a similar body to be found inside.

00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:55.275
You will be officially recorded...

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:56.935
as having died in the blaze.

00:09:59.075 --> 00:10:00.405
As if drowning was not enough,

00:10:01.275 --> 00:10:03.745
now you expect me to live my life afraid of fire too?

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:05.984
And I am supposed to live like that...

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:07.585
after shattering His Highness' heart again?

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:10.685
No, I cannot do that! I have to go to the palace!

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:13.025
You cannot! Brother, stop her!

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:19.325
Why are you all doing this?

00:10:20.665 --> 00:10:23.095
Your Highness, please. Just give up.

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:24.705
You have to leave.

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:28.105
I know it is hard now, but this will all pass.

00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:31.545
Time will keep moving, and it heals all wounds.

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.045
Brother, take Her Highness.

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:49.525
Stop crying.

00:10:49.855 --> 00:10:52.595
They said you will die if you go back now.

00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:57.535
If I just leave like this,

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:01.475
what about His Royal Highness?

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.005
For the last five years,

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:07.775
I have made him live in a nightmare.

00:11:10.745 --> 00:11:13.845
And you want me to put him back in that nightmare again?

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:16.215
I cannot do that.

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.355
I just cannot.

00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:22.595
- I just cannot do it. - Goodness.

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:27.395
Does it pain you that much?

00:11:30.135 --> 00:11:31.165
Goodness.

00:11:31.935 --> 00:11:35.735
You cannot just turn off feelings for someone.

00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:37.875
Time heals all wounds.

00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:40.205
But that is only if you let time pass.

00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:47.385
How can you heal if you keep reliving that day?

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:53.685
Your Highness.

00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:10.135
- What do you think you are doing? - I am sorry, Hong Nan.

00:12:10.775 --> 00:12:12.175
Go on, Dal!

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:14.674
Today is the day for lovers.

00:12:14.675 --> 00:12:17.445
We will be your bridge to him.

00:12:17.515 --> 00:12:20.115
What are you waiting for? The bridge will be gone!

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:22.085
- Go on, hurry! - Go!

00:12:22.155 --> 00:12:23.285
No!

00:12:24.415 --> 00:12:25.955
- Your Highness! - Go on!

00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:27.355
- Let me go! - Go.

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:29.855
I am a crow! Go!

00:12:30.695 --> 00:12:31.765
- Your Highness! - Go on!

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:35.595
- Go! - Your Highness!

00:12:36.195 --> 00:12:38.805
- Dal! - Go on!

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.375
Your Highness!

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.585
Your Highness!

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:24.345
Do you two have any idea what you have just done?

00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:28.585
Your emotions got the better of you and sent Dal to her death!

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:30.454
She would rather die. We had no choice.

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:32.225
If she feels that way, she must go.

00:13:32.685 --> 00:13:34.485
How can you act so detached?

00:13:35.025 --> 00:13:36.455
I know you are not her birth parents,

00:13:36.825 --> 00:13:40.365
- but you raised her for five years! - But, Hong Nan!

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:42.365
It is her life, is it not?

00:13:43.435 --> 00:13:46.335
A parent can die for their child,

00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:48.835
but they cannot live their child's life for them.

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:50.205
That is right.

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:53.775
You are still hung up on a promise you made to your lost love.

00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:57.215
Imagine Dal leaving a living love.

00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:59.585
- Brother. - We know from experience.

00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:03.415
- Some loves are worth dying for. - Exactly.

00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:04.725
What can we do? They are so in love.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:06.455
It makes them blind to everything else.

00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:14.495
What a fool.

00:14:15.265 --> 00:14:16.265
Me?

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.205
Not you.

00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:21.235
That foolish girl.

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:23.935
Why did she have to leave?

00:14:24.575 --> 00:14:25.775
Why did she have to die?

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:28.345
She must have been so lost...

00:14:29.575 --> 00:14:31.315
and then some.

00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:33.885
Who are you talking about?

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:40.755
Gang Yeon Wol.

00:14:45.565 --> 00:14:46.565
Right.

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:49.465
I am done overthinking it.

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:52.565
His Royal Highness is fighting a war every single day.

00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:57.405
He must be torn apart over that secret pact.

00:14:58.405 --> 00:15:01.345
I cannot just sit here in a daze because some memories are back.

00:15:01.845 --> 00:15:06.115
Your Highness. I do not understand a single word you are saying.

00:15:06.315 --> 00:15:08.455
You do not have to. It is all nonsense anyway.

00:15:10.715 --> 00:15:13.724
First, I must go to the throne hall.

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:15.125
Wait. Your Highness.

00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:20.125
You cannot just go see His Majesty whenever you please.

00:15:20.365 --> 00:15:23.395
- You must be summoned first... - He is going to summon me anyway.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:28.205
This just saves us some time. From now on, it is an emergency.

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:30.075
Wait...

00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:31.745
All right.

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:35.215
As a matter of fact, I was about to send for you.

00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:37.945
What were you thinking coming back here?

00:15:39.145 --> 00:15:41.045
Did they not tell you who you are?

00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:42.555
They told me.

00:15:44.185 --> 00:15:47.385
- Most of my memory has returned. - Then you should have run away.

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:51.695
- Why would you come back? - Why would I run away?

00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:54.365
The Left State Councillor will stop at nothing to kill you.

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.335
Yes, you are right, Your Majesty.

00:15:56.665 --> 00:15:59.865
The Left State Councillor wants me dead regardless of my title.

00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:03.475
He is desperate enough to bring a false witness before the King,

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:06.245
and his men are all over the country.

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:08.745
If he is already set on killing me,

00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:11.715
would it not be easier for him to do it outside the palace?

00:16:14.245 --> 00:16:15.255
But...

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:18.685
it is only a matter of time before he learns who you really are.

00:16:18.825 --> 00:16:21.224
Exactly. Running away now...

00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:22.825
is admitting I am the Crown Princess.

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:24.595
Why would I give him that kind of leverage?

00:16:24.925 --> 00:16:26.725
After that humiliation at the interrogation ground,

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:28.935
he cannot use a witness to prove who I am anymore.

00:16:29.795 --> 00:16:31.935
He needs hard evidence to prove that I am the Crown Princess,

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:33.505
and where would he ever find that?

00:16:35.935 --> 00:16:37.005
The Left State Councillor...

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:40.375
is a terrifying man.

00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:43.475
He will stop at nothing to kill you.

00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.415
Then the Crown Prince...

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:48.715
will risk his life to protect you,

00:16:49.755 --> 00:16:52.025
and I still remain incompetent and powerless as ever,

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.355
unable to protect either of you.

00:16:57.395 --> 00:16:59.495
Nothing has changed since five years ago.

00:17:02.435 --> 00:17:03.695
Nothing has changed at all.

00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:05.965
No.

00:17:13.005 --> 00:17:14.105
I have changed.

00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:18.985
I am not the same Yeon Wol who quietly vanished five years ago.

00:17:20.445 --> 00:17:21.955
Whether I have my memories back or not,

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:25.925
I am going to stay right by His Royal Highness's side...

00:17:27.525 --> 00:17:29.555
and spend the rest of my life with him.

00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:31.895
I am Park Dal now.

00:17:37.395 --> 00:17:40.205
I am not leaving...

00:17:41.735 --> 00:17:43.035
His Highness' side, ever.

00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:48.845
As much as I care for His Royal Highness...

00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:51.985
No, even more than that.

00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:56.985
I know you want to protect him too, Your Majesty.

00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:02.755
Do not let fear make you think only of His Highness' physical safety.

00:18:05.865 --> 00:18:06.995
For once...

00:18:09.195 --> 00:18:10.395
Just this once,

00:18:11.295 --> 00:18:13.305
please think about how His Highness feels.

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:17.775
Please?

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:25.215
For the past five years,

00:18:26.215 --> 00:18:28.044
His Highness has been tormented by guilt,

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:29.455
living every single day in his own personal nightmare.

00:18:31.085 --> 00:18:33.225
His Highness has only just started to breathe again.

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:37.555
Will you send him back to despair to drown all over again,

00:18:38.865 --> 00:18:39.965
Royal Father?

00:18:47.405 --> 00:18:50.835
(Chapter 11: There Is No Paradise in Running Away)

00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:02.385
Ever since he was captured at Jemulpo,

00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:04.515
he has done nothing but drink.

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:06.725
Are you just going to keep this up?

00:19:06.985 --> 00:19:09.195
I do not know...

00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:11.395
how else to be.

00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.025
Snap out of it!

00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:15.495
Give it here.

00:19:17.395 --> 00:19:19.435
No. You are already drunk.

00:19:20.735 --> 00:19:24.035
What good would sobering up do me?

00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:31.985
U Hui is confined to the Detached Palace, is she not?

00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:37.055
By rule, a royal consort is to remain in the Detached Palace.

00:19:37.415 --> 00:19:38.425
That is right.

00:19:38.855 --> 00:19:42.555
The palace has always been one giant prison, after all.

00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:45.925
I told our Royal Father to abdicate the throne.

00:19:47.725 --> 00:19:48.735
Abdicate?

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:50.894
The Left State Councillor's only hold on Father...

00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:52.235
is because of the secret pact.

00:19:52.965 --> 00:19:54.705
If he admits the coup had no just cause...

00:19:54.935 --> 00:19:56.235
and abdicates the throne to you,

00:19:56.775 --> 00:19:58.404
you, as the Late King's true heir,

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:00.045
will have the authority to punish the Left State Councillor.

00:20:02.315 --> 00:20:03.315
You want me...

00:20:04.415 --> 00:20:05.815
to sit on the throne?

00:20:07.445 --> 00:20:09.784
The bloody throne that killed my mother...

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:11.725
and got me exiled?

00:20:12.885 --> 00:20:13.885
And then what?

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:18.325
Who would I have left by my side?

00:20:20.365 --> 00:20:22.535
After casting you and His Majesty out,

00:20:22.895 --> 00:20:26.235
and stand by and watch U Hui, branded a traitor's daughter,

00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:30.435
why should I have to live on, sitting on that agonizing throne?

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:32.345
If that is the price,

00:20:33.405 --> 00:20:35.075
I would rather not have revenge at all.

00:20:36.245 --> 00:20:37.245
Un.

00:20:38.815 --> 00:20:41.615
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

00:20:42.185 --> 00:20:45.585
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:47.625
The Left State Councillor...

00:20:48.995 --> 00:20:50.725
Can we not just kill him?

00:20:51.055 --> 00:20:53.065
If it were that easy, I would have done it long ago.

00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:56.365
The Left State Councillor is surrounded by his personal guards,

00:20:56.765 --> 00:20:59.965
and in the palace, the Royal Guard protects him, not my Royal Father.

00:21:00.335 --> 00:21:02.275
And his own martial arts skill is formidable.

00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:06.205
Honestly, he is a legend among the military cadets.

00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:09.115
Exactly.

00:21:09.615 --> 00:21:11.515
Things would be so simple if he were just gone.

00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:13.885
Just wait.

00:21:14.915 --> 00:21:16.815
If you despise the thought of taking the throne that much,

00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:21.055
- I will find another way. - Is there another way?

00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:23.755
Gang,

00:21:24.795 --> 00:21:27.795
do not do anything. Just...

00:21:29.035 --> 00:21:30.235
stay out of it.

00:21:43.575 --> 00:21:44.715
Your Highness.

00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:47.685
I am fine.

00:21:48.245 --> 00:21:51.185
You are not fine. You have been acting odd all day.

00:21:51.955 --> 00:21:53.155
Maybe you have heatstroke?

00:21:57.355 --> 00:21:58.355
I guess so.

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:00.965
It has not rained,

00:22:01.995 --> 00:22:03.295
and the sun is so strong.

00:22:04.195 --> 00:22:05.265
I must have heatstroke.

00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:07.265
This will not do.

00:22:08.935 --> 00:22:10.075
Please sit and rest for a bit.

00:22:11.975 --> 00:22:15.214
Your Highness, I will get you some cool water.

00:22:15.215 --> 00:22:16.515
Please just sit here for a moment.

00:23:31.815 --> 00:23:33.285
I have missed you, my love.

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:38.495
Your Highness, here is your water.

00:23:41.765 --> 00:23:42.765
Yeon Sim.

00:23:43.235 --> 00:23:44.235
Yes?

00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:46.265
Today,

00:23:47.435 --> 00:23:51.435
my mind has been a total mess,

00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:54.445
and I could not make sense of anything.

00:23:55.005 --> 00:23:57.375
I know. That is why you should drink this.

00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:01.985
But...

00:24:04.185 --> 00:24:05.455
there is one thing I know for sure now.

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:09.225
I have to see His Royal Highness right now.

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.495
Oh, gosh! Wait!

00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:36.215
Dal. What are you doing here?

00:24:41.255 --> 00:24:42.255
No!

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:46.165
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

00:24:47.365 --> 00:24:48.425
We will, no matter what,

00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:51.435
be together!

00:25:16.055 --> 00:25:17.295
I am here so we can be together.

00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:42.615
Please do not tell His Highness that my memory has returned.

00:25:44.255 --> 00:25:45.855
He is already going through so much as it is.

00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:48.685
I do not want to give him more reason to worry.

00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:51.595
And I know I have no right to ask,

00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:54.765
but please look after my family.

00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:06.005
Head Eunuch Park.

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:14.845
Disguise reliable Royal Guards as servants at Unjeong Palace...

00:26:15.685 --> 00:26:17.555
and have them protect the Crown Princess's family.

00:26:19.285 --> 00:26:22.955
The Left State Councillor must not get his hands on her family.

00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:26.265
Then will you keep the Crown Princess in the palace?

00:26:26.895 --> 00:26:29.095
If I fail to protect her again,

00:26:31.065 --> 00:26:32.935
my son, Gang, will be broken.

00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:40.905
The kids have changed in the past five years,

00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:44.515
so I must change as well as the adult.

00:26:55.955 --> 00:26:56.995
His Majesty...

00:26:58.055 --> 00:27:00.595
sent the Royal Guards to Unjeong Palace?

00:27:01.065 --> 00:27:04.265
Yes. The Royal Concubine's family is staying at Unjeong Palace,

00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:06.005
and Hong Nan, a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion,

00:27:07.005 --> 00:27:08.305
is said to be the Royal Concubine's aunt.

00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:10.905
I did not report it as I was unsure,

00:27:11.305 --> 00:27:14.275
but her neighbours said something odd before they died.

00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:16.274
They said the Royal Concubine suddenly appeared in Boryeong...

00:27:16.275 --> 00:27:17.745
in winter five years ago,

00:27:17.975 --> 00:27:19.845
and that she is not, in fact, Lord Heo's wife's niece.

00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:22.045
They claim it is all true.

00:27:22.685 --> 00:27:24.555
Why are you only telling me this now?

00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:26.885
At the time, I thought they lied to save their own skin.

00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:28.585
I deserve death.

00:27:29.855 --> 00:27:32.055
Round up the Royal Concubine's family and bring them to me.

00:27:32.425 --> 00:27:34.124
Forgive me, sir, but Unjeong Palace...

00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:35.165
was His Majesty's private residence.

00:27:35.295 --> 00:27:36.865
We cannot enter without authorization.

00:27:42.675 --> 00:27:43.705
I will find a way.

00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:51.245
It seems His Majesty...

00:27:52.745 --> 00:27:56.715
still lets his personal feelings get in the way.

00:28:01.085 --> 00:28:03.425
All right, time for bed.

00:28:17.575 --> 00:28:19.845
What are you doing?

00:28:20.475 --> 00:28:23.445
What is it? Can I not look at my own husband?

00:28:23.515 --> 00:28:24.515
Is there a problem with that?

00:28:25.215 --> 00:28:27.545
No, I mean, I like it,

00:28:29.255 --> 00:28:31.085
but you are making me shy.

00:28:31.615 --> 00:28:33.025
It is just a little embarrassing, that is all.

00:28:33.425 --> 00:28:34.425
It is making me blush.

00:28:49.975 --> 00:28:52.445
Even if you are shy, bear with me. I am making up for lost time.

00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:53.945
Making up for what?

00:28:56.145 --> 00:28:57.145
Wait...

00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:00.145
From now on,

00:29:00.745 --> 00:29:01.745
I am...

00:29:02.285 --> 00:29:03.685
going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

00:29:04.755 --> 00:29:06.455
I am never letting you go.

00:29:13.765 --> 00:29:17.135
Is this a signal for tonight?

00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:19.665
Maybe tonight...

00:29:22.035 --> 00:29:23.975
Stuck like glue...

00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:31.645
You little fox.

00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:33.645
You can just fall asleep after all that?

00:29:35.585 --> 00:29:37.155
I am not a fox...

00:29:38.415 --> 00:29:39.455
Then who are you?

00:29:40.255 --> 00:29:41.285
What does it matter...

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:44.025
what I am?

00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:47.425
I am just stuck on you.

00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:51.865
Stuck on you...

00:30:58.095 --> 00:30:59.305
Household Man.

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:03.475
Household Man!

00:31:13.845 --> 00:31:16.055
Oh, my, has it gotten so late?

00:31:33.605 --> 00:31:34.765
Household Man!

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:03.725
The wind is blowing.

00:33:05.695 --> 00:33:07.595
I suppose it has been for a while.

00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:10.765
The wind always blows.

00:33:12.865 --> 00:33:13.905
That is nothing new.

00:33:17.205 --> 00:33:18.235
I suppose you are right.

00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:21.245
And yet, even the wind that always blows,

00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:23.715
the very air I breathe...

00:33:24.545 --> 00:33:26.645
It all feels different to me now.

00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:30.715
I cannot remember the last time I could breathe so easily.

00:34:21.865 --> 00:34:24.034
Your Highness, what shall I do about the former Chief Royal Secretary...

00:34:24.035 --> 00:34:26.275
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece?

00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:30.015
Oh, right. With everything going on, I had completely forgotten.

00:34:30.515 --> 00:34:32.984
First, exile the former Chief Royal Secretary, and...

00:34:32.985 --> 00:34:34.015
Your Royal Highness!

00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:38.085
- Goodness. - Gosh.

00:34:38.715 --> 00:34:39.755
Dal.

00:34:40.355 --> 00:34:41.525
What are you doing here?

00:34:41.925 --> 00:34:44.655
I was waiting for you to catch you on your way, Your Highness.

00:34:45.455 --> 00:34:47.695
You did not have to. I would have come to you.

00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:49.795
You startled me.

00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:52.935
I know you are busy with your official duties.

00:34:53.365 --> 00:34:57.105
Rather than sit in my room, I wanted to steal a moment with you.

00:34:57.305 --> 00:34:58.735
What has gotten into you since yesterday?

00:34:59.375 --> 00:35:02.545
Not that I am complaining, of course. Have you eaten?

00:35:02.945 --> 00:35:05.515
- Not yet. - Should we go get a bite to eat?

00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:07.315
Your Highness.

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:09.754
You were giving your orders on the former Chief Royal Secretary...

00:35:09.755 --> 00:35:11.185
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece.

00:35:11.385 --> 00:35:13.755
- Please continue. - Right.

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:15.994
Exile the former Chief Royal Secretary,

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:17.995
and make Jo Mi Geum, the sinner, a slave on the island.

00:35:18.455 --> 00:35:21.865
- Have the Guards tighten security. - Yes, Your Highness.

00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:23.165
Your Royal Highness.

00:35:24.265 --> 00:35:27.205
If they are sent to separate places of exile,

00:35:28.035 --> 00:35:29.475
does that mean they will never see each other again?

00:35:30.035 --> 00:35:32.505
I would assume so, yes.

00:35:37.945 --> 00:35:41.085
Your Royal Highness, could you do just one thing for me?

00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:42.685
One thing?

00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:51.495
Mi Geum.

00:35:51.855 --> 00:35:52.925
Mi Geum.

00:35:55.425 --> 00:35:56.595
Why did you do that?

00:35:57.265 --> 00:35:58.835
You should have just turned me in.

00:36:00.005 --> 00:36:02.635
I would rather die than let you die.

00:36:03.735 --> 00:36:06.505
Then how am I supposed to live? Mi Geum.

00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:10.815
Mi Geum...

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.815
- Goodness. Now that is true love. - Mi Geum...

00:36:17.515 --> 00:36:18.555
Hey, are you crying?

00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:22.455
That is not true love.

00:36:25.495 --> 00:36:30.035
What love traps the one left behind in a living nightmare forever?

00:36:34.405 --> 00:36:35.405
That is why...

00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:38.535
I will never, ever die.

00:36:41.005 --> 00:36:42.475
I will not go down without a fight.

00:36:44.575 --> 00:36:45.575
Never.

00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:03.365
You are right. Let us live.

00:37:06.405 --> 00:37:07.665
Let us both live a long life.

00:37:14.905 --> 00:37:16.615
My lord, it is your household man.

00:37:17.245 --> 00:37:18.615
Come in.

00:37:21.385 --> 00:37:23.585
My goodness, what is all this?

00:37:24.915 --> 00:37:26.385
Can you not tell just by looking?

00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:28.455
They are pinwheels.

00:37:31.595 --> 00:37:33.994
No, I mean, why use this expensive coloured paper...

00:37:33.995 --> 00:37:36.895
to make so many useless pinwheels?

00:37:37.035 --> 00:37:39.535
"Useless," you say?

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:42.465
Do you know...

00:37:43.175 --> 00:37:46.145
what I heard more than anything when I was at the palace?

00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:50.515
"The child who will be the death of his father."

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:52.045
"The child of the prophecy."

00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:56.285
If the Royal Mother were to give birth to a son,

00:37:56.585 --> 00:37:58.455
the Royal Father would die.

00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:00.985
The Royal Family would fall.

00:38:02.025 --> 00:38:03.725
Well, that was the prophecy.

00:38:05.695 --> 00:38:06.695
In the end,

00:38:07.025 --> 00:38:08.395
it came true, just as it was foretold.

00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:12.235
So that means...

00:38:12.805 --> 00:38:15.405
I was someone who should have never been born in the first place.

00:38:16.435 --> 00:38:17.535
Just like these pinwheels,

00:38:18.805 --> 00:38:20.545
I was useless.

00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:22.775
Do not say such ridiculous things.

00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.015
And just have this to sober up and get some sleep.

00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:28.145
You are still drunk. That is why you are having ridiculous thoughts.

00:38:30.855 --> 00:38:32.715
That is what I like about you.

00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:34.725
Yes, my lord.

00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:36.954
I like you too, my lord, so drink up.

00:38:36.955 --> 00:38:38.755
Drink this, and live a long life.

00:38:47.835 --> 00:38:51.235
Your Highness. Please just have one bite.

00:38:51.975 --> 00:38:53.945
Are you really trying to starve yourself to death?

00:38:54.205 --> 00:38:55.245
Do not worry.

00:38:55.775 --> 00:38:57.675
I have no intention of pathetically starving myself to death.

00:38:57.815 --> 00:38:59.685
Then why did you stop eating?

00:38:59.985 --> 00:39:01.685
Because dying from indigestion is absurd.

00:39:03.455 --> 00:39:05.685
How can you be joking right now?

00:39:06.225 --> 00:39:07.785
If I were to speak seriously,

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:12.295
- you would probably end up crying. - Why do you say such scary things?

00:39:16.635 --> 00:39:18.395
There has been no word from Deok Chun, has there?

00:39:18.895 --> 00:39:19.905
No, Your Highness.

00:39:20.665 --> 00:39:23.135
He said he was leaving the capital, remember?

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:27.545
But I need to see Deok Chun.

00:39:29.475 --> 00:39:30.475
What?

00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:33.215
What is going on outside?

00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.155
Oh, my.

00:39:37.515 --> 00:39:39.825
What? What is all that?

00:39:54.735 --> 00:39:59.075
I mean, what kind of madman would put these pinwheels at the palace?

00:40:01.005 --> 00:40:02.505
- Oh, my. - What is all this?

00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:11.015
Your Highness.

00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:38.275
I will orchestrate your father's downfall,

00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:40.745
and all you have to do is hold this ring.

00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:46.725
The wind will always blow, so just breathe easy...

00:40:47.155 --> 00:40:48.185
and smile often.

00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.825
You deserve to be happy,

00:40:51.325 --> 00:40:52.325
my precious,

00:40:53.065 --> 00:40:54.225
my dear U Hui.

00:41:02.935 --> 00:41:03.935
U Hui!

00:41:05.005 --> 00:41:06.005
Kim U Hui!

00:41:09.445 --> 00:41:10.815
Is that not Grand Prince Je Un?

00:41:12.175 --> 00:41:13.185
I love you!

00:41:14.245 --> 00:41:15.845
I love you, Kim U Hui!

00:41:19.015 --> 00:41:21.785
- Seize him! He is over there! - Get him!

00:41:30.735 --> 00:41:32.035
What are we going to do?

00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:34.405
I think he has really lost his mind.

00:41:39.575 --> 00:41:40.575
What was that?

00:41:41.075 --> 00:41:42.175
Grand Prince Je Un?

00:41:42.605 --> 00:41:45.515
Yes, it was unmistakably him.

00:41:45.645 --> 00:41:47.245
I came at once,

00:41:47.315 --> 00:41:48.785
fearing what he might do next.

00:41:49.685 --> 00:41:52.885
I fear he may have lost his mind.

00:41:53.255 --> 00:41:55.455
If he has not lost his mind,

00:41:56.795 --> 00:41:58.795
then he must have a death wish.

00:42:07.535 --> 00:42:09.975
- Something feels off. - I know, right?

00:42:10.235 --> 00:42:12.374
If he were sane, he would not dare say that...

00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:13.975
in front of the Detached Palace.

00:42:14.105 --> 00:42:16.075
Of course not.

00:42:18.045 --> 00:42:19.315
It is not like him at all.

00:42:23.915 --> 00:42:25.655
What on earth could he be thinking?

00:42:27.655 --> 00:42:28.925
Are you finished, Your Royal Highness?

00:42:29.155 --> 00:42:32.155
Yes. Take this royal edict to the Royal Investigation Office,

00:42:32.395 --> 00:42:34.324
and have the former Chief Royal Secretary and that court lady...

00:42:34.325 --> 00:42:36.665
Your Royal Highness!

00:42:36.865 --> 00:42:38.695
What is it now? What?

00:42:39.435 --> 00:42:42.765
Grand Prince Je Un made a scene in front of the Detached Palace.

00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:44.705
A scene? What kind?

00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:47.845
He was shouting the Crown Princess Consort's name over and over,

00:42:48.475 --> 00:42:52.845
screamed, "I love you," and made a huge scene.

00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:55.485
Seriously, what on earth is wrong with him?

00:42:56.315 --> 00:42:58.215
Does he have a death wish or something?

00:42:58.815 --> 00:43:01.655
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:05.755
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

00:43:06.725 --> 00:43:07.725
The Left State Councillor...

00:43:09.065 --> 00:43:10.865
Can we not just kill him?

00:43:12.635 --> 00:43:15.065
Gang, do not do anything. Just...

00:43:16.205 --> 00:43:17.235
stay out of it.

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:05.715
Left State Councillor!

00:44:23.935 --> 00:44:24.935
Who goes there?

00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:30.115
Stand back.

00:44:32.675 --> 00:44:34.515
If any of you interfere in this fight,

00:44:35.015 --> 00:44:36.955
I will cut you down myself.

00:44:37.715 --> 00:44:39.715
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

00:44:42.085 --> 00:44:44.225
I thought you had lost your mind,

00:44:44.855 --> 00:44:47.195
but it seems you have simply lost your will to live.

00:44:47.925 --> 00:44:49.025
That is because...

00:44:51.965 --> 00:44:54.635
you took away my reason for living.

00:45:40.545 --> 00:45:43.115
You have quite the romantic streak.

00:45:43.955 --> 00:45:44.985
Your escape,

00:45:45.585 --> 00:45:47.025
the scene at the Detached Palace,

00:45:48.355 --> 00:45:50.555
and your last wish just now.

00:45:51.755 --> 00:45:53.365
I am not finished.

00:46:09.545 --> 00:46:10.975
The more I think about it,

00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:13.685
the more I am convinced I must kill you.

00:46:43.475 --> 00:46:45.375
- My lord! - Stay back.

00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:48.545
Die.

00:46:48.815 --> 00:46:49.885
Die!

00:46:51.315 --> 00:46:53.185
Die!

00:46:57.725 --> 00:46:59.625
- Je Un! - Grand Prince!

00:47:06.935 --> 00:47:09.965
- Let go! Let me go! - Get Je Un out of here!

00:47:10.105 --> 00:47:11.605
- Yes, Your Royal Highness! - I said, let go!

00:47:14.505 --> 00:47:16.945
Let me go. Let go!

00:47:17.945 --> 00:47:19.115
Left State Councillor!

00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:20.645
Left State Councillor!

00:47:21.285 --> 00:47:22.745
Left State Councillor!

00:47:23.145 --> 00:47:24.685
Let go! Let go of me!

00:47:25.115 --> 00:47:27.355
- My lord. - Left State Councillor...

00:47:27.625 --> 00:47:29.255
Left State Councillor!

00:47:31.525 --> 00:47:33.195
Left State Councillor!

00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:46.945
Though it was not my intention,

00:47:48.045 --> 00:47:49.605
I now owe you my life.

00:47:59.115 --> 00:48:00.525
Why did you go easy on him?

00:48:05.325 --> 00:48:06.325
I guess...

00:48:07.265 --> 00:48:09.695
my blade hesitated.

00:48:14.165 --> 00:48:17.075
So, shall we pretend today never happened either?

00:48:17.705 --> 00:48:18.975
I would appreciate that.

00:48:20.505 --> 00:48:22.545
The more secrets we share,

00:48:22.905 --> 00:48:26.885
the closer we become, Your Royal Highness.

00:48:27.485 --> 00:48:28.485
Just like...

00:48:29.345 --> 00:48:31.555
His Majesty and I.

00:48:36.525 --> 00:48:38.355
Speaking of which,

00:48:39.355 --> 00:48:40.625
if I were to die,

00:48:41.095 --> 00:48:43.395
someone else will release the secret pact.

00:48:44.165 --> 00:48:46.035
I just thought you should know.

00:48:47.635 --> 00:48:48.665
I appreciate the information.

00:49:03.555 --> 00:49:06.055
- Let go of me! - Please calm down, my lord.

00:49:06.115 --> 00:49:07.925
- Please! - No, you cannot.

00:49:07.985 --> 00:49:09.885
- Just let me... - You cannot, my lord.

00:49:11.195 --> 00:49:13.865
Did you not know killing the Left State Councillor meant execution?

00:49:14.495 --> 00:49:16.835
Do you think I came here without knowing that?

00:49:17.465 --> 00:49:20.035
Why did you stop me? Why?

00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:29.675
So this is the brilliant plan you made after drinking for days?

00:49:30.345 --> 00:49:32.745
To kill the Left State Councillor and die along with him?

00:49:34.815 --> 00:49:35.815
Yes.

00:49:36.245 --> 00:49:40.015
Everyone knows this fight is over when the Left State Councillor dies.

00:49:40.085 --> 00:49:41.285
If only he dies!

00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:47.365
The abdication stops, and U Hui will not be a traitor's daughter!

00:49:48.125 --> 00:49:49.165
Then what about me?

00:49:50.765 --> 00:49:51.835
And the woman you love?

00:49:52.835 --> 00:49:54.305
How is Kim U Hui supposed to live?

00:50:01.575 --> 00:50:02.575
I...

00:50:06.215 --> 00:50:08.315
I want to live too.

00:50:08.885 --> 00:50:11.715
I want to live a happy life with U Hui. But...

00:50:12.915 --> 00:50:14.725
there is no other way, is there?

00:50:24.835 --> 00:50:25.835
Je Un.

00:50:26.565 --> 00:50:28.565
If a path is blocked, we will force it open.

00:50:29.765 --> 00:50:31.505
If there is no path, we will make one.

00:50:33.405 --> 00:50:35.645
You would rather die than ascend the throne,

00:50:36.445 --> 00:50:38.475
and I would rather die than let you die,

00:50:39.275 --> 00:50:40.285
So, let us...

00:50:41.485 --> 00:50:42.845
find another way.

00:50:45.985 --> 00:50:47.055
Let us survive this.

00:50:48.925 --> 00:50:50.595
Let us live, Je Un.

00:51:07.175 --> 00:51:10.745
If you give the order, we will go and capture Grand Prince Je Un.

00:51:11.475 --> 00:51:12.875
I let him go.

00:51:14.885 --> 00:51:18.515
Why do you always show such mercy to Grand Prince Je Un?

00:51:22.055 --> 00:51:23.285
Bring me a drink.

00:51:27.095 --> 00:51:28.125
Here you are.

00:51:32.535 --> 00:51:36.365
But I thought you never touched alcohol?

00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:37.705
You may leave now.

00:51:39.505 --> 00:51:40.505
Yes, my lord.

00:52:24.785 --> 00:52:25.785
Am I not...

00:52:27.885 --> 00:52:30.395
fighting a losing battle?

00:52:38.395 --> 00:52:42.865
What? Even if he was blinded by rage,

00:52:42.935 --> 00:52:45.205
what was he thinking, going to the Left State Councillor's house alone?

00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:46.635
He went there to die.

00:52:48.175 --> 00:52:51.215
That Grand Prince Je Un really needs a good scolding.

00:52:52.115 --> 00:52:54.015
He has no regard for his own life.

00:52:55.245 --> 00:52:56.485
I am the one who should be scolded.

00:52:57.115 --> 00:52:58.115
Me and my Royal Father.

00:52:58.685 --> 00:52:59.984
You are blaming yourself again.

00:52:59.985 --> 00:53:01.625
No, I am not. It is damage control.

00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:03.895
It seems our path is blocked,

00:53:04.395 --> 00:53:05.425
so I am going to force it open.

00:53:06.995 --> 00:53:08.525
Do you have a plan?

00:53:09.465 --> 00:53:12.835
The Left State Councillor said his death releases the secret pact.

00:53:12.895 --> 00:53:15.865
So he gave it to someone else for safekeeping.

00:53:16.405 --> 00:53:18.035
You have anyone in mind?

00:53:18.435 --> 00:53:19.435
Choraengi Mask.

00:53:20.945 --> 00:53:22.145
Kim Deok Chun.

00:53:22.875 --> 00:53:24.245
She is the most likely suspect.

00:53:24.515 --> 00:53:25.945
Who is Kim Deok Chun?

00:53:26.715 --> 00:53:28.585
She was the daughter of a slave in the Left State Councillor's home.

00:53:29.215 --> 00:53:30.585
She was a female Royal Physician.

00:53:31.615 --> 00:53:33.755
So she was right under our noses this whole time.

00:53:34.485 --> 00:53:37.955
So the Left State Councillor must have given Kim Deok Chun something.

00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:41.965
But is Choraengi Mask not in hiding?

00:53:42.765 --> 00:53:43.765
Then we will find her.

00:53:44.135 --> 00:53:46.565
We got through a collapsed cave. We are capable of anything.

00:53:48.035 --> 00:53:50.675
I will start by digging into the Cheonghye Merchant Guild.

00:53:51.105 --> 00:53:52.405
The Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

00:53:53.075 --> 00:53:57.215
Did Choraengi Mask use that guild to import the Jimjo feed?

00:53:59.775 --> 00:54:01.515
Since it is a merchant guild,

00:54:01.915 --> 00:54:03.615
we can just find them through the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

00:54:04.155 --> 00:54:07.585
As Head Merchant, he knows all guilds inside and out.

00:54:17.395 --> 00:54:19.235
Come to the Royal Office of Attire by tomorrow afternoon.

00:54:19.665 --> 00:54:21.635
I am looking for a way to defeat the Left State Councillor.

00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:33.675
Is that what you call a disguise?

00:54:36.215 --> 00:54:37.215
Gosh, you!

00:54:37.755 --> 00:54:41.255
Have you lost your mind? I know you want the tiger, but this?

00:54:41.555 --> 00:54:44.625
If you go into the tiger's den alone on a suicide mission,

00:54:45.225 --> 00:54:46.695
what are the rest of us going to do?

00:54:47.025 --> 00:54:48.025
What?

00:54:48.625 --> 00:54:50.295
When His Highness told me about it yesterday,

00:54:50.595 --> 00:54:52.435
my heart just dropped. Did you know that?

00:54:57.175 --> 00:54:59.675
I am sorry to have worried you, Your Highness.

00:55:00.275 --> 00:55:01.775
Do not dare die.

00:55:03.345 --> 00:55:05.615
No matter how cruel and twisted this world gets,

00:55:06.915 --> 00:55:08.615
do not just give in and die.

00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:12.985
When you are dead, you cannot remember those you love,

00:55:14.225 --> 00:55:16.355
and those who remember you can no longer hold you.

00:55:17.455 --> 00:55:18.755
What a terrible waste that would be.

00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:20.665
And so unfair.

00:55:28.505 --> 00:55:29.505
So...

00:55:31.705 --> 00:55:32.875
do not throw it all away.

00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:38.915
Let us stay alive.

00:55:39.515 --> 00:55:40.515
Okay?

00:55:45.315 --> 00:55:46.485
Hold it right there.

00:55:48.755 --> 00:55:51.625
- Gang. - Your Royal Highness.

00:56:04.105 --> 00:56:05.535
Are you just going to keep staring?

00:56:06.975 --> 00:56:09.575
Do not mind me. I am just...

00:56:10.675 --> 00:56:13.775
a sitting sticky rice cake. Just think of me that way.

00:56:14.945 --> 00:56:15.945
I see.

00:56:16.445 --> 00:56:19.115
Would not a sitting sticky rice cake be even more distracting?

00:56:27.395 --> 00:56:28.395
So,

00:56:28.695 --> 00:56:29.765
what about the thing I asked you to check?

00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.135
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:56:32.635 --> 00:56:34.065
According to the Head Merchant,

00:56:34.135 --> 00:56:36.805
the Cheonghye Guild was made by the men from The Nameless...

00:56:36.865 --> 00:56:39.005
as a front for smuggling.

00:56:39.205 --> 00:56:40.205
The Nameless?

00:56:40.275 --> 00:56:42.345
Yes. They are called The Nameless because they have no name...

00:56:42.405 --> 00:56:44.515
and also because they shun the light.

00:56:44.645 --> 00:56:48.214
Your Highness, they use loan-sharking for human trafficking,

00:56:48.215 --> 00:56:50.684
do all kinds of smuggling, and counterfeit coins.

00:56:50.685 --> 00:56:52.515
They will do anything for money.

00:56:52.585 --> 00:56:55.885
- They are just vile scoundrels. - They are lower than animals.

00:56:56.125 --> 00:56:58.095
Then how are scoundrels like that still at large?

00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:00.965
According to the Head Merchant,

00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:03.325
the Left State Councillor is apparently their backer.

00:57:04.865 --> 00:57:05.935
The Left State Councillor?

00:57:06.065 --> 00:57:08.705
In fact, they have already ruined the market economy,

00:57:08.765 --> 00:57:10.635
so the Head Merchant wanted to teach them a lesson,

00:57:10.705 --> 00:57:13.005
but even for a man as powerful as the Head Merchant,

00:57:13.435 --> 00:57:16.505
the Police Bureau will not listen to him. This clearly...

00:57:16.805 --> 00:57:20.045
means their backer must be someone equal to the Left State Councillor.

00:57:20.615 --> 00:57:22.645
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

00:57:24.655 --> 00:57:27.385
They either have a death wish,

00:57:28.485 --> 00:57:30.185
or they follow orders without question.

00:57:32.525 --> 00:57:34.095
Do you suspect something?

00:57:45.535 --> 00:57:48.405
Shin Won, do you remember what the Sinjusa assassins were wearing?

00:57:49.545 --> 00:57:50.545
Yes.

00:57:51.015 --> 00:57:53.475
Now that you mention it, the Left State Councillor's men at Jemulpo...

00:57:53.545 --> 00:57:56.015
and Sinjusa assassins wore the same clothes, did they not?

00:57:56.685 --> 00:57:57.985
My thoughts exactly.

00:57:58.485 --> 00:58:00.155
The Choraengi Mask wore the same outfits too.

00:58:00.955 --> 00:58:03.025
It means the Crown Princess Consort must know something.

00:58:03.325 --> 00:58:05.654
The Detached Palace is too guarded.

00:58:05.655 --> 00:58:07.995
We cannot reach the Crown Princess Consort, can we?

00:58:09.495 --> 00:58:10.735
That is the problem.

00:58:16.505 --> 00:58:17.675
I will do it.

00:58:18.805 --> 00:58:20.005
Getting to the Crown Princess Consort,

00:58:20.675 --> 00:58:21.745
I will do it.

00:58:23.745 --> 00:58:25.075
Do you have a plan?

00:58:25.445 --> 00:58:28.985
If one road is blocked, there is always another way around.

00:58:37.555 --> 00:58:40.965
Your Majesty. Did you rest well last night?

00:58:41.525 --> 00:58:42.695
What is it now?

00:58:43.195 --> 00:58:44.965
It is a surprise that you came to pay your respects.

00:58:50.135 --> 00:58:51.175
Since I...

00:58:51.575 --> 00:58:53.375
started living in the palace,

00:58:53.835 --> 00:58:57.075
I have found the life of a royal woman to be terribly dull.

00:58:57.375 --> 00:59:00.075
So naturally, you came to mind, Your Majesty.

00:59:00.445 --> 00:59:02.315
You must want something from me.

00:59:02.845 --> 00:59:04.685
Your Majesty, that is hurtful.

00:59:04.955 --> 00:59:07.215
How can you twist my pure intentions like that?

00:59:08.455 --> 00:59:10.555
Search your heart.

00:59:10.825 --> 00:59:12.195
Have you ever once...

00:59:12.395 --> 00:59:15.265
come to me out of the goodness of your heart?

00:59:21.465 --> 00:59:24.675
Gosh. They do not just let anyone be the Queen Dowager, right?

00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:27.705
Your insight is incredible, as always.

00:59:29.145 --> 00:59:31.415
Gosh, you and your flattery.

00:59:32.975 --> 00:59:33.975
All right, then.

00:59:34.645 --> 00:59:36.985
Since you are here, let us hear it.

00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:40.015
How will you amuse me today?

00:59:41.285 --> 00:59:44.025
You know I used to be a peddler, right?

00:59:44.895 --> 00:59:47.095
From my travels all over the eight provinces,

00:59:47.225 --> 00:59:50.725
I have collected a lot of juicy stories.

00:59:51.365 --> 00:59:52.634
Do not dare.

00:59:52.635 --> 00:59:55.935
How dare you bring vulgar stories into the palace?

00:59:57.475 --> 01:00:01.845
So, the physician, her husband, and that homewrecker... I mean,

01:00:02.305 --> 01:00:03.945
they went to the mistress's family home?

01:00:04.245 --> 01:00:07.215
Yes. The physician, bold as brass, said,

01:00:08.115 --> 01:00:11.015
"Your daughter has been sleeping with my husband."

01:00:11.615 --> 01:00:12.655
And then,

01:00:13.015 --> 01:00:15.925
the mistress slapped the physician across the face.

01:00:16.725 --> 01:00:17.725
My goodness.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:21.795
The shameless hussy! And the husband?

01:00:22.665 --> 01:00:24.435
What did the husband do?

01:00:26.735 --> 01:00:28.965
He grabbed the physician by the hand,

01:00:29.605 --> 01:00:32.135
and as he was dragging her out, he yelled,

01:00:35.175 --> 01:00:37.375
"Is it a crime to be in love?"

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:39.545
Can you believe the nerve?

01:00:39.975 --> 01:00:41.945
That worthless scoundrel!

01:00:43.815 --> 01:00:46.955
So there was this good-for-nothing freeloader,

01:00:47.015 --> 01:00:51.394
who fell for his wife's best friend, whom she had taken in!

01:00:51.395 --> 01:00:52.395
Her friend?

01:00:52.396 --> 01:00:53.854
After he kicked out his devoted wife,

01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:55.364
her sister saw them getting groceries at the market,

01:00:55.365 --> 01:00:56.865
being all lovey-dovey.

01:00:57.065 --> 01:01:00.395
When the wife's sister saw that, she would just see red, would she not?

01:01:00.495 --> 01:01:01.905
She certainly would.

01:01:01.965 --> 01:01:05.705
So she went to confront them, and the mistress dared to say,

01:01:06.305 --> 01:01:10.745
"Have some class." So the sister totally snapped.

01:01:11.075 --> 01:01:12.345
"Class?"

01:01:12.745 --> 01:01:16.785
"This is my class!" Then she grabbed her hair...

01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:20.885
and started yanking her head left and right.

01:01:21.055 --> 01:01:23.355
- Left, right. - That is the way!

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:28.195
Left.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.565
Right.

01:01:40.735 --> 01:01:42.505
Becoming a supportive wife...

01:01:44.315 --> 01:01:46.015
is so darn hard.

01:01:50.645 --> 01:01:51.655
What?

01:01:52.315 --> 01:01:54.015
Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter?

01:01:54.555 --> 01:01:55.555
Yes.

01:01:57.355 --> 01:02:01.565
Now that it is out that Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter,

01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:06.565
maybe it is time you did me that favour.

01:02:11.135 --> 01:02:14.405
My patience has run out. That is why you are here.

01:02:15.045 --> 01:02:17.545
You are to be the Crown Princess of this nation.

01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:20.175
And yet, you act so thoughtlessly?

01:02:20.675 --> 01:02:22.515
Is this how your father raised you?

01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:26.285
Crown Princess Consort, you need to reflect on your conduct.

01:02:49.245 --> 01:02:52.245
- I need to ask you something first. - Do not worry.

01:02:52.545 --> 01:02:54.285
Grand Prince Je Un is safe.

01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:58.315
But how did you know I was going to ask about him?

01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:02.125
They say only one who has been in love can recognise it.

01:03:02.955 --> 01:03:05.195
The feeling of being madly in love but forced to be apart...

01:03:05.495 --> 01:03:06.755
You think I would not understand that?

01:03:09.395 --> 01:03:11.295
All right, let us get down to business.

01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:16.005
The assassins operating at Sinjusa.

01:03:16.665 --> 01:03:18.205
Are they part of The Nameless?

01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:22.975
And the Choraengi Mask, Kim Deok Chun.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:26.675
- Is she one of them too? - How do you know that?

01:03:26.745 --> 01:03:29.014
We are short on time. Let us get to the point.

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:30.585
Where is their base?

01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:32.915
I only know what Deok Chun told me, so I am not sure,

01:03:32.985 --> 01:03:35.055
but I heard they have branches in all four corners of the country.

01:03:35.585 --> 01:03:38.755
I think I might have heard something about a mountain fortress.

01:03:39.455 --> 01:03:40.455
A mountain fortress.

01:03:42.225 --> 01:03:43.665
Anything else unusual about them?

01:03:44.635 --> 01:03:48.705
Like when Choraengi Mask went there, maybe it took a few days,

01:03:48.765 --> 01:03:51.075
or maybe she often bought something. Anything like that.

01:03:52.835 --> 01:03:54.804
She would often bring her sick mother...

01:03:54.805 --> 01:03:56.605
chestnut honey and some liquor.

01:03:57.575 --> 01:03:58.575
Chestnut honey?

01:04:00.715 --> 01:04:01.815
What kind of liquor?

01:04:03.185 --> 01:04:05.815
I think it might have been pine needle wine.

01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:12.555
Is it songyeopju?

01:04:13.155 --> 01:04:14.155
Could it be Yangju?

01:04:15.065 --> 01:04:16.564
- What? - Yangju chestnuts...

01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:19.465
are famous enough to be offered as royal tribute.

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:24.065
Songyeopju is the signature liquor of the Yeosan Song clan in Yangju.

01:04:25.135 --> 01:04:27.805
I guess I should tell them to search Yangju first.

01:04:30.645 --> 01:04:33.415
If you find Deok Chun, please tell her to come see me.

01:04:34.585 --> 01:04:36.615
Tell her I have something urgent to discuss about her mother.

01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:43.555
Forgive me. We still have not gotten the Royal Concubine's family...

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.655
out of Unjeong Palace.

01:04:46.095 --> 01:04:47.425
What about the head of Eunwol Pavilion?

01:04:47.825 --> 01:04:50.564
We have not made contact with them.

01:04:50.565 --> 01:04:52.495
Hong Nan was in hiding.

01:04:53.395 --> 01:04:56.405
So why would she suddenly appear at Eunwol Pavilion?

01:04:56.905 --> 01:04:58.735
I will capture Eunwol Pavilion's head at once.

01:05:07.475 --> 01:05:10.115
There were dozens of assassins at Sinjusa alone.

01:05:11.015 --> 01:05:12.715
This organisation must be massive.

01:05:12.985 --> 01:05:15.325
If they have branches across all eight provinces,

01:05:15.755 --> 01:05:17.185
this is no small-scale operation.

01:05:18.425 --> 01:05:19.895
There must be hundreds of them, at least.

01:05:20.995 --> 01:05:24.535
The Nameless. A group so large is basically a private army.

01:05:25.435 --> 01:05:26.535
This is treason.

01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:28.705
According to this letter from Dal,

01:05:29.565 --> 01:05:30.935
the Choraengi Mask is in Yangju,

01:05:31.235 --> 01:05:32.905
and The Nameless are in a mountain fortress.

01:05:33.575 --> 01:05:36.375
Let us search the nearby mountains. We are bound to find something.

01:05:37.745 --> 01:05:40.045
Should I grab a map on the way, then?

01:05:40.845 --> 01:05:42.345
I saw a stall selling them on our way here.

01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:51.024
- What can I help you find? - We are headed to the mountains.

01:05:51.025 --> 01:05:53.755
- The mountains? Which ones? - Hey.

01:05:54.255 --> 01:05:56.624
- It is right here. - Those mountains.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:57.995
- Let us see. - It is marked plain as day.

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:01.805
- Here we go. This should do. - How much for this?

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:04.835
His Majesty?

01:06:12.245 --> 01:06:14.014
If she rashly escapes, it could give...

01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:16.445
the Left State Councillor the pretext he needs,

01:06:16.945 --> 01:06:19.285
so for now, I intend to keep the Royal Concubine here.

01:06:19.785 --> 01:06:22.025
From the moment you brought the royal guards to Unjeong Palace,

01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:24.795
it shows...

01:06:25.795 --> 01:06:27.355
that you are worried, Your Majesty.

01:06:29.095 --> 01:06:32.735
You have only ever cared about His Highness.

01:06:34.265 --> 01:06:37.065
You never thought of Her Highness, the Crown Princess.

01:06:38.405 --> 01:06:40.405
And now, because you are worried His Royal Highness might get hurt,

01:06:40.905 --> 01:06:43.475
are you going to send Her Highness to her death all over again?

01:06:45.645 --> 01:06:46.675
Yes.

01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:49.945
Just as you said, my son is my only concern.

01:06:52.185 --> 01:06:55.155
However, the Crown Princess is his only concern.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.255
Therefore, the Crown Princess...

01:06:59.825 --> 01:07:00.825
No.

01:07:01.965 --> 01:07:03.695
Protecting the Royal Concubine...

01:07:05.295 --> 01:07:06.395
is how I protect...

01:07:06.965 --> 01:07:08.805
the Crown Prince, my son.

01:07:16.175 --> 01:07:17.175
Gang.

01:07:18.215 --> 01:07:19.315
What...

01:07:21.615 --> 01:07:23.715
What in the world are you talking about?

01:07:26.385 --> 01:07:27.455
What do you mean the Royal Concubine...

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.295
is the Crown Princess?

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:36.665
- It is just... - Tell me what happened!

01:07:41.865 --> 01:07:42.965
I am so sorry.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.185
Five years ago,

01:07:58.215 --> 01:07:59.655
afraid she might bring you harm, Your Highness,

01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:02.585
she threw herself into the river.

01:08:04.055 --> 01:08:06.295
She lost all her memories then.

01:08:08.295 --> 01:08:10.825
Right now, Her Highness herself...

01:08:12.265 --> 01:08:14.265
knows who she is.

01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:17.665
I am going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:20.435
I am never letting you go.

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:41.395
Your Highness!

01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:53.674
- Your Highness! - Where is the Royal Concubine?

01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:55.045
She should be in the Royal Kitchen.

01:08:58.445 --> 01:08:59.645
Your Highness.

01:09:06.355 --> 01:09:09.385
She went to the Eastern Palace, saying she had something for you.

01:09:13.755 --> 01:09:14.765
Your Highness.

01:09:16.765 --> 01:09:18.494
- Where is the Royal Concubine? - She left...

01:09:18.495 --> 01:09:20.035
to her quarters after waiting, Your Highness.

01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:16.455
When I opened my eyes,

01:10:17.285 --> 01:10:18.895
my mind was completely blank,

01:10:19.725 --> 01:10:21.325
but my memory was just a black void.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.865
A life where I do not have to run anymore.

01:10:24.465 --> 01:10:25.695
A life where I can settle down...

01:10:27.065 --> 01:10:28.805
and make a real family of my own.

01:10:30.265 --> 01:10:31.934
Leave Hanyang this instant.

01:10:31.935 --> 01:10:33.435
This is the price someone as lowly as you...

01:10:34.745 --> 01:10:36.345
has to pay for having a face like yours.

01:10:36.645 --> 01:10:38.075
That is why you are so angry, is it not?

01:10:38.275 --> 01:10:39.815
Because someone as lowly as myself...

01:10:42.185 --> 01:10:44.385
looks like the Crown Princess.

01:10:46.455 --> 01:10:48.485
Because of me, that precious woman...

01:10:53.455 --> 01:10:54.655
On those small feet,

01:11:00.365 --> 01:11:02.035
she walked such a long and difficult road back to me.

01:11:05.035 --> 01:11:06.175
All because of me.

01:11:09.005 --> 01:11:10.145
All because of me.

01:11:14.745 --> 01:11:15.745
Your Highness.

01:11:48.285 --> 01:11:50.045
Your Highness, is something the matter?

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:01.795
They say if you catch a falling flower petal...

01:12:07.065 --> 01:12:10.135
Do you know what happens if you catch a falling flower petal?

01:12:32.525 --> 01:12:33.525
I...

01:12:36.025 --> 01:12:37.525
must have caught two.

01:12:44.135 --> 01:12:45.335
After all, my first love and I...

01:12:49.245 --> 01:12:51.875
ended up married twice.

01:13:07.195 --> 01:13:08.325
I...

01:13:09.165 --> 01:13:10.595
I am so sorry.

01:13:12.035 --> 01:13:13.595
I am so sorry.

01:13:15.335 --> 01:13:16.465
For far too long,

01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:20.705
I left you all alone.

01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:24.915
I am so sorry.

01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:34.115
At a time like this,

01:13:36.355 --> 01:13:39.395
you should not be on your knees. You should be holding me.

01:13:53.035 --> 01:13:54.475
Like you will never let go.

01:14:17.895 --> 01:14:18.895
I am sorry.

01:14:36.745 --> 01:14:41.725
(Moon River)

01:15:02.745 --> 01:15:05.145
What if we just ran away?

01:15:05.415 --> 01:15:09.815
- A letter was outside your room. - Identify yourself, Your Highness.

01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:13.855
What can His Royal Highness possibly do?

01:15:13.915 --> 01:15:16.455
Harbouring a traitor is a grave offence.

01:15:16.525 --> 01:15:17.655
Stop the execution!

01:15:19.295 --> 01:15:22.665
The Royal Concubine... No, Deposed Crown Princess Gang...

01:15:23.295 --> 01:15:24.625
is hereby sentenced to death by hanging.

01:15:40.645 --> 01:15:45.155
(Moon River)
