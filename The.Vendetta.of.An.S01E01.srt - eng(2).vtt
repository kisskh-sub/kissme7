IT WON'T BE LONG
UNTIL WE RETURN TO CHANG'AN

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.345
In the 28th year of Qiansheng,

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.105
the founding emperor fell ill suddenly

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:40.105
and passed away unexpectedly.

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:43.265
General of the Huben Army, Yan Fengshan,
took control of the imperial court

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:45.105
and threw the government into chaos.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.465
He helped the late emperor's youngest son,
Xiao Wenjing, ascend the throne

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.465
and killed the feudal lords,

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.145
causing imperial authority to decline.

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:56.625
In the 4th year of Wencheng,

00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:00.065
the late emperor's eldest son,
a feudal lord, Xiao Wuyang,

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:01.785
mobilized troops from the north

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:04.585
to overthrow the tyranny.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:06.465
They traveled 1,300 li southward.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:08.305
With strict military discipline
along the way,

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.185
all sides submitted to him.

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.185
He arrived in Chang'an,

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:13.825
eliminated the treacherous officials,

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:16.905
and took control of the imperial court.

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:42.225
TAIQING PALACE

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:08.305
XIAO WUYANG, NEW EMPEROR

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.985
Unable to bear the defeat,
the deposed emperor, Xiao Wenjing,

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:17.785
burned himself inside Taiji Hall.

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:40.105
Your Highness,
there were five dead bodies.

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:41.385
None of them were the deposed emperor.

00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:44.825
GU YU, MARQUIS OF NORTHGUARD

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.225
Have you verified all of them?

00:04:47.305 --> 00:04:50.705
The deposed emperor fell
on a Hanbaiyu staircase as a child.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:53.505
Because of that,
his upper left molar was chipped.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.065
He also fractured his left leg.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.705
All of this is recorded
in the palace archives.

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:00.345
These dead bodies might be unrecognizable,

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.385
but it is not difficult
to verify these injuries.

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.465
Your Highness, we just pulled this
from one of the corpses.

00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:29.665
It finally turned up.

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:31.985
It was set up on purpose.

00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:35.345
They are waging war against Xiao Wuyang.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:41.505
All subordinates
of the city-guarding general,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:42.945
Li Longjing, have surrendered.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:44.825
There might still be
skirmishes in the city,

00:05:44.905 --> 00:05:46.545
but it's nothing to worry about.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:48.425
We've captured
all 12 gates of the Capital.

00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:49.865
We will set up camps

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:52.145
in the south and southwest.

00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:55.745
Moreover, the north side of the city
is under our army's control.

00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:56.785
The north is secure.

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:02.065
What about Yan Fengshan and his army?

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.225
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:23.465
WISDOM AND DEPTH

00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:26.105
The scene at Taiji Hall has been examined.

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:28.625
The deposed emperor, Xiao Wenjing,

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:30.705
did not die in the fire.

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.145
This was recovered from the stomach

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:38.305
of one of the dead bodies in Taiji Hall.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.705
I'm sure Your Majesty
recognizes the token.

00:06:57.425 --> 00:06:59.145
A Huben Token.

00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:01.625
Does it mean

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:06.345
he has abducted
that useless brother of mine?

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:07.585
Yes.

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:10.465
Xiao Wenjing might be useless,

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:13.065
but one can rule the world
simply by abducting the emperor.

00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:17.905
Perhaps this battle is far from over.

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:22.425
Perhaps it is just the beginning.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:26.385
Yan Fengshan and the Huben Army
have decided to stay hidden

00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:28.705
because they do not want
to face Your Majesty directly.

00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:31.705
But as long as
the deposed emperor is in his hands,

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.105
he will surely rise again.

00:07:35.185 --> 00:07:39.265
A hidden battle will soon begin.

00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:15.745
I am old.

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:16.945
I was careless.

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:20.425
When you are facing Yan Fengshan,

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:25.185
no one can win in one move.

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:27.585
I do recommend one particular person

00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:29.945
if you plan to face the Huben Army.

00:08:31.025 --> 00:08:34.345
He understands the army better
than anyone in this world.

00:08:34.425 --> 00:08:36.385
His father, Liu Ziwen,

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.425
is the founder of the Huben Army.

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:39.784
Fifteen years ago,

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:43.625
Yan Fengshan led the Huben Army
and betrayed Liu Ziwen.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.825
The Liu clan was annihilated.

00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:54.265
He was fortunate enough to survive.

00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:58.545
He is an exceptional talent.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.985
Moreover, he carries a grudge.

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:05.825
After 15 years, he is now fully prepared.

00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:10.465
Many former retainers of the Liu clan
are also helping him secretly.

00:09:10.545 --> 00:09:12.345
An exceptional talent?

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.265
How does he compare to you?

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.105
I am old.

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:17.465
I'm inferior to him.

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:26.625
In that case, bring him to me.

00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:29.505
I will test him myself.

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:31.105
Understood.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:35.425
HUAINAN

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:47.825
Be careful with that.

00:09:48.665 --> 00:09:50.425
There's more over here.

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:52.705
Have some water.

00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:57.305
In times of turmoil,

00:09:57.385 --> 00:09:59.305
the government stalls
and the people suffer.

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:01.385
Extraordinary individuals will arise

00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:03.185
like leopards and magpies.

00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:05.105
With the momentum of soaring eagles,

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:06.665
they achieve remarkable feats.

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:11.545
Therefore, extraordinary accomplishments
require extraordinary people.

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:13.185
How extraordinary.

00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:15.185
As extraordinary as I am ignorant.

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:17.465
No need for you to understand.

00:10:17.545 --> 00:10:18.905
As long as I

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.345
and the officials above me understand it.

00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:22.665
Just listen to these sentences.

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:26.825
Divide and reclaim the land
to rebuild the realm.

00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:29.185
With Heaven's mandate to crush the rebels,

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:30.545
no rebellion can stand.

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.465
With righteous deeds to attain merit,

00:10:32.545 --> 00:10:34.305
all great feats may be accomplished.

00:10:34.825 --> 00:10:36.665
The sentences are magnificent

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:39.185
and every word is exquisite.

00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:41.665
All of you are bumpkins.

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:43.065
Don't even dream of writing that,

00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:44.265
not in this life or the next.

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:49.825
Sir, we specialize in repairing roofs
and catching chickens

00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.105
for the residents.

00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.385
You cannot compare us to them.

00:10:53.465 --> 00:10:54.665
Exactly, sir.

00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:56.145
Yes.

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:57.105
That's right, sir.

00:10:57.185 --> 00:10:59.465
Sir! Sir!

00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:00.865
What is it?

00:11:00.945 --> 00:11:02.025
The imperial envoy is near the city gates.

00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:05.145
All of you, pull yourselves together.

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:08.145
Come with me to meet the imperial envoy.

00:11:08.225 --> 00:11:10.425
Huai'an? Where is our beloved Huai'an?

00:11:12.465 --> 00:11:13.425
Huai'an!

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:15.905
Huai'an!

00:11:22.585 --> 00:11:24.985
Huai'an! The imperial gazette is here!

00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:29.745
XIE HUAI'AN

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:33.025
Be careful.

00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:37.105
I just got it.

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:42.105
That's all you harvested after half a day?

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:45.905
The weather is good today.

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:47.745
I'm letting the paddy dry in the sun.

00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:50.665
Sure. If you say so.

00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:52.985
I've read the imperial gazette.

00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:54.665
The latest issue is from a month ago.

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:57.665
It's fine even if it's late.

00:11:57.745 --> 00:11:59.865
At least, we know
what is happening out there.

00:12:00.505 --> 00:12:04.025
Huainan is remote and desolate.

00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:07.505
What happens outside
has nothing to do with this place.

00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:26.825
The weather is changing.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:31.545
Yes. Rain is coming
from behind the mountain.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.945
Ziya. Look at this article.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:43.145
It has been a month since Xiao Wuyang
attacked Xigu Mountain City.

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:46.345
After passing Xigu Mountain City,

00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:49.345
it's only 300 li from Chang'an.

00:12:50.225 --> 00:12:51.385
There is no choke point in between

00:12:53.385 --> 00:12:54.905
to defend against any attack.

00:12:56.185 --> 00:12:59.585
I'm sure Chang'an
won't be captured so easily.

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:01.905
The Imperial Guards
are in charge of Chang'an's defense.

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:05.705
The soldiers are all from noble families.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:09.665
They have adequate military strength,
but look at General Li.

00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:11.385
His name is Li Longjing.

00:13:11.985 --> 00:13:13.745
He is a coward.

00:13:14.465 --> 00:13:18.025
Chang'an might have been captured already.

00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:21.265
That's impossible.
An imperial envoy has come from Chang'an.

00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:23.825
Zhou Mo is probably waiting at the gates

00:13:23.905 --> 00:13:25.265
with your proclamation against the rebels.

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:26.985
What?

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.745
HUAINAN

00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:37.905
Sir, what's taking them so long?

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:38.905
Waiting on your wife?

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.225
How fast do you want them?

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:41.985
You are useless.

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:47.785
HUAINAN DISTRICT OFFICE

00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:54.185
What is it? Is the imperial envoy here?

00:13:55.345 --> 00:13:57.225
I wrote a tribute for the new emperor.

00:13:57.305 --> 00:13:58.145
Help me find it, now.

00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:01.585
There's no congratulatory article here.
Didn't you write to condemn the rebels?

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:03.385
Zhou Mo took it
to meet the imperial envoy.

00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:04.985
That article must not be submitted.

00:14:05.065 --> 00:14:06.305
One and a half months ago,

00:14:06.385 --> 00:14:08.025
Xiao Wuyang took Xigu Mountain City.

00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:10.745
The city is only 300 li away
from Chang'an.

00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:12.945
There's no choke point left to stop him.

00:14:13.025 --> 00:14:15.265
I'm sure Chang'an
won't be captured that easily.

00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:17.025
It has already been captured.

00:14:17.105 --> 00:14:18.945
The imperial envoy serves the new emperor.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.065
If Zhou Mo submits the article,
we'll all be dead.

00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:23.585
-That's…
-Enough.

00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:24.905
Look for it, quickly.

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:27.265
When did you write it?

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:28.585
Two years ago.

00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:30.505
Two years ago?
Are you some kind of prophet?

00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:34.305
Found it.

00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:36.305
They are here. Play the music!

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:37.305
Quick, sound the drum.

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:45.705
Why does he look like a eunuch?

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:48.105
Look like a eunuch? He is a eunuch.

00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:49.665
It's my first time seeing one.

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:51.545
Stop talking from now on.

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.305
I, the Magistrate of Huainan District,
Zhou Mo,

00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:04.305
greet the imperial envoy.

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:07.465
You may stand, Magistrate.

00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.865
Thank you, Imperial Envoy.

00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:20.945
Huainan District is so remote.

00:15:21.025 --> 00:15:23.625
I think I've traveled
70 li of mountainous roads

00:15:23.705 --> 00:15:25.425
to arrive here from the county.

00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:29.345
Sir, Huainan might be remote,

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:32.265
but every land here
belongs to the emperor.

00:15:32.345 --> 00:15:36.465
The people of Huainan
are also blessed by His Majesty's grace.

00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:38.265
You have a silver tongue.

00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:39.305
Imperial Envoy,

00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:43.065
I've prepared the best inn
in the district town

00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:46.065
to give you a warm welcome.

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:48.905
That's right. One more thing.

00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:52.865
We have prepared an article
for you to peruse

00:15:52.945 --> 00:15:54.385
when you arrive.

00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:55.825
Show me.

00:16:15.585 --> 00:16:18.025
Sorry, sir. Are you hurt?

00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:19.145
How absurd!

00:16:19.225 --> 00:16:20.545
Which…

00:16:22.305 --> 00:16:23.625
He's one of our own.

00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:25.025
Sorry, Imperial Envoy.

00:16:25.665 --> 00:16:26.785
I am the registrar here.

00:16:26.865 --> 00:16:28.785
I apologize for my reckless action.

00:16:28.865 --> 00:16:30.145
I'm very sorry.

00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:37.465
Sorry.

00:16:37.545 --> 00:16:40.385
Sir, this is
the congratulatory article you wrote.

00:16:40.465 --> 00:16:42.505
Please show it to the imperial envoy.

00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:51.665
Sir.

00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.465
What a good article. How impressive.

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:07.505
I've traveled across the realm
and read 80 tributes

00:17:07.585 --> 00:17:08.905
celebrating His Majesty's ascension.

00:17:08.985 --> 00:17:10.665
This is the best one yet.

00:17:12.385 --> 00:17:14.265
Mr. Zhou,
your literary talent is remarkable.

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:17.505
You shouldn't humble yourself
in this desolate place.

00:17:17.585 --> 00:17:18.424
When I return,

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:21.265
I will put in a good word
to His Majesty for you.

00:17:24.464 --> 00:17:26.545
Thank you, sir.

00:17:27.905 --> 00:17:30.505
Oh. Beyond declaring the new emperor,

00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:31.745
I had one more task.

00:17:31.825 --> 00:17:35.065
I also traveled to your district
for one more purpose.

00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:36.425
Do tell, sir.

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:39.345
Do you have someone called Xie Huai'an
in your district?

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:44.385
His Majesty has summoned Xie Huai'an
to the Capital.

00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:49.465
I am Xie Huai'an.

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:01.825
The imperial envoy said

00:18:02.345 --> 00:18:06.865
your journey to the Capital
would be paid for by the district office.

00:18:06.945 --> 00:18:10.545
We must ensure a comfortable trip for you
in terms of food and accommodation.

00:18:11.665 --> 00:18:13.065
Thank you, sir.

00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:15.745
He also said

00:18:16.665 --> 00:18:18.985
that when you arrive in Chang'an,

00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:21.785
an academic named Li
from the Imperial Academy

00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:23.305
will be there to receive you.

00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:29.225
This man is famous in the Capital.

00:18:29.745 --> 00:18:31.505
He will welcome you in person.

00:18:34.705 --> 00:18:36.865
The imperial envoy also said…

00:18:36.945 --> 00:18:38.185
He said something else?

00:18:38.705 --> 00:18:42.745
His Majesty is going to meet Huai'an
in person

00:18:43.985 --> 00:18:47.185
and order him to do something huge.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:52.185
The imperial envoy
wants you to depart tomorrow

00:18:52.705 --> 00:18:55.105
without any delay.

00:18:56.465 --> 00:18:57.545
Huai'an,

00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:02.465
you said you'd be my registrar forever.

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:05.745
Enough. Stop pouring.
He is completely drunk.

00:19:05.825 --> 00:19:07.185
It's fine.

00:19:08.465 --> 00:19:09.745
I'm going to leave anyway.

00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:12.145
Tonight, just let him drink
to his heart's content.

00:19:14.305 --> 00:19:15.345
Zhou Mo,

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:17.705
I used to tell you

00:19:18.305 --> 00:19:20.705
I'd either be your registrar forever,

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:24.305
or head straight to the court.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.265
I won't choose any other path.

00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:29.745
Before today,

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:32.425
I thought I'd stay in Huainan forever.

00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:37.865
You are a good superior
and a good friend of mine.

00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:44.705
Being your registrar isn't that bad.

00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:53.305
Sir, why are you crying?

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.465
He sounds so devoted.

00:19:55.985 --> 00:19:58.665
My friend is loyal.

00:19:58.745 --> 00:20:01.625
What's wrong with me
crying just for a while?

00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:09.505
I believe you will complete
His Majesty's task dutifully.

00:20:10.225 --> 00:20:11.505
Right?

00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:16.985
The two of us will soon meet again.

00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:20.145
Right?

00:20:21.865 --> 00:20:22.745
That's right.

00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:28.745
But it might not be necessary
to return here just to reunite.

00:20:34.265 --> 00:20:35.705
This is a farewell gift.

00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:40.305
I don't know if your career as an official
will be smooth in the future.

00:20:40.385 --> 00:20:44.345
But if you are no longer an official
one day,

00:20:45.225 --> 00:20:46.945
open this letter.

00:20:47.745 --> 00:20:50.865
It'll be easier
for us to gather in the future.

00:20:51.905 --> 00:20:52.945
All right.

00:20:54.265 --> 00:20:55.585
Let's make a toast to Huai'an.

00:20:55.665 --> 00:20:56.745
-Sure!
-Drink up!

00:20:56.825 --> 00:20:58.865
Huai'an, may you soar to great heights.

00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:01.505
Huainan is good

00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:04.185
A safe haven

00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:09.865
The mountains and rivers
Stretch on like our affection

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:10.825
An affectionate person…

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:12.145
When you were 17 years old,

00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:14.705
you carried a tattered pack

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:17.305
and came to Huainan, a remote place,

00:21:17.385 --> 00:21:19.385
like a homeless man.

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:21.225
You worked as a registrar for seven years,

00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:22.945
and served four magistrates.

00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:25.985
When they left, they wanted
to take you with them but you refused.

00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:30.225
All of us knew
you were destined for great things.

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:34.865
We treated you well
not because we wanted you to help us out

00:21:34.945 --> 00:21:38.905
when you achieved success one day,
but we did so out of sincerity.

00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:44.305
However, you are also aloof.

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:47.345
Yes.

00:21:47.425 --> 00:21:49.185
But that's who I am.

00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:57.345
Are you that happy?

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:01.105
Lie here and count the stars
as your punishment.

00:22:07.865 --> 00:22:09.345
Stars!

00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:12.985
Stars, why are you so far away?

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:16.505
You are as far as Chang'an.

00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:18.665
Enough already.

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:28.745
Do you know
why I only have two paths to choose from?

00:22:30.505 --> 00:22:31.745
Why?

00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:42.625
I am a descendant of a condemned official.

00:22:44.465 --> 00:22:48.145
Fifteen years ago,
my family was wronged and annihilated.

00:22:49.825 --> 00:22:51.785
I was fortunate enough to survive.

00:22:52.665 --> 00:22:55.025
Since then, I've been living in hiding.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:57.665
I slept in the wilderness.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.745
I've lived in the reed swamps.

00:23:05.945 --> 00:23:07.465
Had I taken one wrong step

00:23:09.225 --> 00:23:11.065
back in those days,

00:23:12.545 --> 00:23:14.265
I would have been dead.

00:23:14.785 --> 00:23:17.425
Did your family
offend some powerful figures?

00:23:20.425 --> 00:23:22.105
The dynasty's most powerful man.

00:23:23.825 --> 00:23:25.385
The leader of the Huben Army,

00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:28.225
Yan Fengshan.

00:23:29.225 --> 00:23:30.345
Yan Fengshan?

00:23:30.865 --> 00:23:33.385
His influence spreads
across the imperial court.

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:35.825
But times have changed.

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:40.745
Xiao Wuyang ascended
to the throne as a general.

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:43.465
He won't have Yan Fengshan around.

00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:47.105
I don't know what he wants me to do,

00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:50.225
and I don't know who recommends me.

00:23:51.185 --> 00:23:52.745
But this is my opportunity.

00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:56.345
I must grasp it.

00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:05.945
Huai'an.

00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:09.345
Are you trying
to clear your family's name?

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.345
Everyone is dead.

00:24:23.105 --> 00:24:24.705
There's no use clearing their name.

00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.585
I'm going to take revenge.

00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:45.105
All right. Go back and rest.

00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:46.265
Sleep for six hours.

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:47.905
We'll send you off
at the city gates in the morning.

00:24:48.505 --> 00:24:49.465
Sure.

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:50.785
You all should rest too.

00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:51.945
Sure.

00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.145
Enough. Don't be sad.

00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:01.385
I'm leaving.

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:02.265
Father!

00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:05.545
-Go!
-Father!

00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:08.585
Father!

00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:09.665
Go!

00:26:25.425 --> 00:26:27.185
Go!

00:26:47.265 --> 00:26:48.665
Move a little.

00:26:53.225 --> 00:26:55.745
You came back late
and you're still not sleeping?

00:26:55.825 --> 00:26:57.505
-The sun is coming up.
-I'm not sleeping.

00:26:59.305 --> 00:27:00.225
Why are you taking eggs?

00:27:00.825 --> 00:27:02.065
Huai'an leaves for the Capital tomorrow.

00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:03.305
I want to give him some eggs.

00:27:03.385 --> 00:27:06.425
Here, cook the eggs
so he can take them with him on his way.

00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:08.425
The journey to the Capital is long.

00:27:08.505 --> 00:27:10.305
Cooked eggs go rotten in a few days.

00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:11.945
What should we do?

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:13.545
Just give him some fresh eggs.

00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:14.905
When he feels like eating them,

00:27:14.985 --> 00:27:17.825
he just needs to start a fire,
boil some water, and cook them.

00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:19.345
You are right.

00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:21.065
As expected of my wife.

00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:22.425
-Move.
-What's wrong?

00:27:22.505 --> 00:27:23.825
You have no idea, do you?

00:27:23.905 --> 00:27:25.745
The chickens will lay eggs in a while.

00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:27.225
We can give Huai'an more.

00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:04.545
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR MAJESTY'S ASCENSION

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:16.225
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR MAJESTY'S ASCENSION

00:29:00.345 --> 00:29:01.385
What?

00:29:02.545 --> 00:29:03.985
Are you sad to see me go

00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:07.025
and want me dead instead?

00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:13.065
Go inside.

00:29:24.465 --> 00:29:25.505
Sit down.

00:29:44.065 --> 00:29:44.905
You've read it?

00:29:48.865 --> 00:29:50.705
News is hard to come by in Huainan.

00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:55.705
I deduced what happened in Chang'an
by using old imperial gazettes.

00:29:56.905 --> 00:29:58.665
But you already knew things had changed.

00:29:59.945 --> 00:30:01.625
And your name, Zhou Mo,

00:30:05.745 --> 00:30:06.585
must be a pseudonym.

00:30:07.425 --> 00:30:08.545
I am with the Huben Army.

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:13.985
Huai'an, I didn't lie to you.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:16.585
I didn't lie to Haoran or the rest.

00:30:17.185 --> 00:30:21.345
What I have been showing all of you
is my true character.

00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:25.105
However, I was a member of the Huben Army
before I met all of you.

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:29.305
General Yan Fengshan saved me.

00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:32.305
I pledged my loyalty to him.

00:30:32.945 --> 00:30:35.145
When you were talking
about your background,

00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:36.865
I was shocked.

00:30:37.905 --> 00:30:39.665
I did not expect my friend

00:30:40.705 --> 00:30:42.745
to be a descendant of Liu Ziwen.

00:30:43.785 --> 00:30:46.225
Is fate playing a joke on me?

00:30:46.745 --> 00:30:47.785
Huai'an.

00:30:48.465 --> 00:30:50.225
I might be one of the Huben Army's men,

00:30:50.305 --> 00:30:53.825
but I've never killed anyone until today.

00:30:54.665 --> 00:30:58.865
I did not expect the first person
I would kill to be my friend.

00:30:59.465 --> 00:31:01.625
This cruel fate.

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:05.545
The imperial court must be crawling

00:31:06.745 --> 00:31:07.985
with shadow agents.

00:31:08.065 --> 00:31:09.905
Indeed.

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:14.105
They are like a shapeless net

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:17.425
that hangs above the imperial court.

00:31:18.105 --> 00:31:19.785
You will never win against them.

00:31:22.585 --> 00:31:24.425
This is indeed a cruel joke.

00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:29.385
I thought I'd become a registrar
here forever,

00:31:31.305 --> 00:31:32.905
but to my surprise…

00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:37.225
Forget it.

00:31:52.185 --> 00:31:53.105
Here.

00:31:54.025 --> 00:31:56.025
Drink this farewell wine.

00:31:56.105 --> 00:31:58.545
Forget that we've ever met.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.225
Live or die, we'll have no regrets.

00:32:00.305 --> 00:32:01.825
A cup for life

00:32:02.945 --> 00:32:04.345
and a cup for death.

00:32:10.265 --> 00:32:11.585
Come, Huai'an.

00:32:22.545 --> 00:32:23.585
Life

00:32:27.385 --> 00:32:28.625
for you.

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.785
When I was young,

00:33:04.385 --> 00:33:06.265
my mother died in the north.

00:33:07.505 --> 00:33:08.945
When I was ten years old,

00:33:09.745 --> 00:33:11.625
my father died as well.

00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:19.785
The whole Huben Army
defected and killed him.

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:21.985
I can't die.

00:33:24.345 --> 00:33:26.625
I must get revenge on the Huben Army.

00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:29.705
I'll kill any Huben soldiers I see

00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:33.345
until none of them are left.

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:44.985
I collected the eggs for him.

00:33:45.505 --> 00:33:46.945
Are you sure?

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.465
-I'm sure it was your wife who did that.
-I did it.

00:33:50.665 --> 00:33:51.705
Huai'an.

00:33:51.785 --> 00:33:52.705
-We are here to send you off.
-Huai'an.

00:33:52.785 --> 00:33:53.905
-Look what we brought.
-Huai'an!

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.625
What happened?

00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:16.065
Zhou Mo.

00:34:16.985 --> 00:34:18.264
-Sir!
-What happened?

00:34:20.865 --> 00:34:21.744
Don't ask.

00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.264
It's not his fault.

00:34:25.865 --> 00:34:27.905
Don't tell anyone.

00:34:29.705 --> 00:34:30.705
Don't…

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:33.505
Don't trouble him.

00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:35.585
We all

00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:38.985
have our own reasons.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.665
Zhou Mo.

00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:42.744
-Zhou Mo.
-Sir!

00:34:43.344 --> 00:34:44.425
Zhou Mo!

00:34:45.505 --> 00:34:46.945
-Sir!
-Sir!

00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:49.185
Sir!

00:34:58.145 --> 00:34:59.065
What have you done?

00:34:59.145 --> 00:35:01.105
That's Zhou Mo!

00:35:03.945 --> 00:35:05.105
Stay away from me

00:35:07.225 --> 00:35:09.265
if you don't want to die.

00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:13.665
AUTUMNAL EQUINOX:
THUNDER BEGINS TO SOFTEN

00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:15.705
INSECTS MAKE NESTS,
AND WATER BEGINS TO SOLIDIFY

00:36:34.265 --> 00:36:38.025
The river runs cold. The chill cuts deep.

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:41.345
Travelers, move along.

00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:44.345
Those near the riverbank,
stay away from the shore.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.545
You truly surprise me.

00:36:59.705 --> 00:37:01.505
This place could cost you your life.

00:37:02.025 --> 00:37:03.505
Why did you come back?

00:37:04.705 --> 00:37:06.345
Only one person is buried here.

00:37:06.865 --> 00:37:08.385
It's not a dangerous place.

00:37:09.545 --> 00:37:13.385
The real danger is Chang'an,
70 li away from us.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.905
It seems you truly are only passing by.

00:37:17.345 --> 00:37:20.905
I won't be sharing this fish
with you then.

00:37:24.505 --> 00:37:25.985
I'm going back to Chang'an.

00:37:27.585 --> 00:37:29.425
I don't know if I'll leave alive.

00:37:31.105 --> 00:37:32.745
So, I came to see you

00:37:34.225 --> 00:37:35.385
before I enter Chang'an.

00:37:45.705 --> 00:37:46.905
Right.

00:37:48.345 --> 00:37:51.225
You are bound to return one day.

00:37:55.745 --> 00:37:56.585
Yes.

00:37:57.825 --> 00:38:00.785
Your younger sister
went to Chang'an as well.

00:38:01.305 --> 00:38:02.985
She went to study.

00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:05.785
Perhaps she is an imperial scholar now.

00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:10.865
I know.

00:38:11.785 --> 00:38:13.425
Both of you are so far apart.

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:15.105
How did you know?

00:38:16.345 --> 00:38:18.145
She has been writing letters to me.

00:38:19.145 --> 00:38:20.145
I've been writing back too.

00:38:20.225 --> 00:38:22.185
Why wouldn't you reunite with her?

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:29.905
I dare not.

00:38:31.505 --> 00:38:33.425
It is best that we never reunite.

00:38:35.065 --> 00:38:36.145
None of my family

00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:39.985
ended up well.

00:38:45.905 --> 00:38:47.185
The people of the Liu clan

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:50.065
suffer a harsh fate.

00:38:53.025 --> 00:38:54.945
Her name has been changed.

00:38:57.425 --> 00:38:59.105
Hopefully, she can live her life in peace.

00:38:59.185 --> 00:39:01.585
You've changed your name as well.

00:39:03.425 --> 00:39:04.945
You must be safe.

00:39:06.745 --> 00:39:07.905
Come.

00:39:54.545 --> 00:39:56.785
CHANG'AN

00:40:05.025 --> 00:40:08.305
Mr. Huai'an,
we are both here to pick you up.

00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:12.145
Winter starts today. Snow is falling hard.

00:40:12.225 --> 00:40:13.705
Thank you, both.

00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:16.465
-Mister, let me carry it.
-Open the gates.

00:40:19.185 --> 00:40:20.225
This way.
