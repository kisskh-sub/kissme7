00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.447
Hey, listen.

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:11.908
They're from the best caterer in town.

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.452
Hey, I even waited in line
to buy them for you.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.913
Listen, if we can't finish these later,

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:18.790
share them with the others, okay?

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:23.461
You've got to be mindful of
how things work in this place. You know?

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:26.673
Hey, did I tell you

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.633
I used to stay here too?

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.635
For five years.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:32.637
So when you see me, you should say,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.680
"Hello, my senior."

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:35.140
Why are you here?

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:39.978
I came here…

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.858
I came here…

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:48.361
to…

00:00:51.573 --> 00:00:52.615
apologize.

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:55.160
Do you remember

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.663
I once asked
if you wanted to stick with me?

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:00.582
I wasn't joking.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:02.083
I meant it.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.837
When I was your age,

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:08.965
I always thought

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.594
that if I'd had

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:16.431
an older brother
who could look out for me,

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.517
my life wouldn't have ended up this way.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.354
So when I saw that you, like me,

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.941
had a useless, deadbeat dad
who loved to gamble

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:30.820
and was just as stubborn,

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:34.407
I wondered if I could help you a bit.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.368
That way, maybe your life

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:39.787
would turn out differently from mine.

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:51.216
Talking about that killed my appetite.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.260
I'll get going. Enjoy.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.389
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

00:01:58.473 --> 00:01:59.599
This is my number.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.144
I'll try to get into
some legit business soon.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.354
After you're released,

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:06.564
if you don't know where to go,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.691
come find me.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:48.314
BIG K MIGHTY GOOD, 0933-721-83, CALL ME

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:17.779
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:04:42.762 --> 00:04:44.180
How long have you been looking?

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.645
Don't tell me you didn't sleep all night.

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:58.069
How will you have the energy
to take care of Hsiao-tung?

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:00.321
Yun-chen offered to look after Hsiao-tung

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:02.407
so that we could get some rest, but you…

00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:12.834
All right, well,

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.377
forget it.

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:17.672
I'll take care of Hsiao-tung today.

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:19.507
Rest up at home.

00:05:22.468 --> 00:05:23.970
I'll freshen up.

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:29.559
Speaking of Hsiao-tung…

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:34.021
I've almost forgotten it.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.944
Yesterday, before going to school,

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:41.320
Hsiao-tung told me

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.115
her competition costume didn't fit.

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:46.993
She wanted me to ask Ms. Lin to alter it.

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:52.623
It's past six o'clock?

00:05:53.124 --> 00:05:54.959
Is Hsiao-tung up?

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:57.962
Gosh, she's always like this.

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:00.590
Asks me to wake her up,
but goes back to bed when I do.

00:06:00.673 --> 00:06:02.467
I'll go check. Hsiao-tung.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.509
Hsiao-tung.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.428
Hsiao-tung.

00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:08.473
Hey, wake up!
You're going to be late for school.

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.309
Breakfast is ready. Come down and eat.

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:13.060
Hey, Hsiao-tung!

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:16.022
Stop sleeping in, Hsiao-tung.

00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:27.492
The unidentified body parts
found in Yilan days ago

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:29.368
have now been confirmed

00:06:29.452 --> 00:06:30.536
through DNA matching

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.789
as belonging to Chen, an engineer
reported missing by his family last month.

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:40.671
Police say that seven bags of body parts
were found in total near the crime scene.

00:06:40.755 --> 00:06:43.466
In an attempt
to disrupt the police investigation,

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:46.385
the murderer allegedly removed
the victim's fingerprints

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.471
and all his teeth.

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:52.517
Security footage from the parking lot
where the victim was last seen

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.561
shows that the suspect
even disguised himself as the victim

00:06:55.645 --> 00:06:58.356
and drove his car away from the scene.

00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:01.651
Take the money.

00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:04.820
You need money for everything you do now.

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.406
I'm doing this for Hsiao-tung, not you.

00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:12.703
The police have found Chen Che-li's
and Fan Wei-ting's bodies.

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:14.830
If Chuang Jung-tai is also found,

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:18.334
they will likely look into
their shared past contacts.

00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:20.044
Just to be safe,

00:07:20.545 --> 00:07:22.964
plan your routes to avoid security cameras

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.715
and cut off any leads you can.

00:07:25.216 --> 00:07:26.968
And stop using your current phone.

00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:28.928
Get a burner phone or a prepaid card.

00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:31.222
Anyway, I hope you don't get caught

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:33.432
before you take care of everyone.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:38.187
NAME: LIN MENG-HUNG

00:07:38.938 --> 00:07:42.525
This is the info I got when I checked out
Lin Meng-hung's place earlier.

00:07:42.608 --> 00:07:43.818
His noodle shop is remote.

00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:45.444
There aren't many cameras nearby.

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:47.989
I've marked where the cameras are located.

00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:51.075
Also, Lin Meng-hung's grandma
lives in a nursing home.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.369
He occasionally video calls her.

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:55.913
Other than that, he has no family.

00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:57.665
NAME: CHANG EN-YA

00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:58.791
That's Chang En-ya

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.626
from Hsiao-tung's class.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.170
I found out
what happened to Hsiao-tung that day

00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:06.132
from someone else in their class,
Tsai Wen-ling.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:09.176
According to her,
Chang En-ya was there at the time.

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:12.263
She was in the know

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:14.098
and an accomplice.

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.725
The problem is that

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.604
I got her address
by claiming I was sending her PR packages.

00:08:19.687 --> 00:08:21.939
I scoped out the area
over the past few days

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.733
and found it's a busy location,

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:26.444
making it almost impossible

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:28.404
to avoid all the cameras.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.284
This is enough.

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:35.786
You've done enough.

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:39.165
I'll handle the rest on my own.

00:08:43.586 --> 00:08:46.297
We probably shouldn't meet again
after today.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.090
Just take good care of Hsiao-tung.

00:08:48.174 --> 00:08:49.425
It's better

00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:52.011
if you don't know too much.

00:09:06.484 --> 00:09:07.818
Who is it? I'm going out.

00:09:07.902 --> 00:09:10.154
UNLOCK, DISCONNECT

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:12.990
So annoying.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.996
-Are you Ms. Chang En-ya?
-Yes.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.873
I need your signature for this package.

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:23.167
Which brand sent this?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.794
It's too big.

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:26.545
Bring it in for me.

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:28.464
Hurry, I'm going out.

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:27.982
LIN'S EATERY

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:29.358
Sir, here's the money.

00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:30.735
Thank you, sir.

00:10:32.111 --> 00:10:33.571
Have you had dinner yet?

00:10:35.406 --> 00:10:36.532
Oh.

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.159
Then you have to eat more.

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.119
Don't be a picky eater.

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:44.749
BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND ASSORTED SIDE DISHES

00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:47.293
Menu's on the table. Please sit.
Everything is available today.

00:10:51.213 --> 00:10:53.174
Sorry for the wait. Ready to order?

00:10:56.594 --> 00:10:58.137
One large beef noodle soup.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.054
Okay.

00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:54.443
LIN'S EATERY

00:11:56.278 --> 00:11:57.738
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

00:14:10.162 --> 00:14:12.623
The unidentified body parts
found in Yilan days ago

00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:15.626
have been confirmed through DNA matching

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:19.046
as belonging to Chen, an engineer
reported missing by his family last month.

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:25.719
Police say that seven bags of body parts
were found in total near the crime scene.

00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:28.597
In an attempt
to disrupt the police investigation,

00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:31.517
the murderer allegedly removed
the victim's fingerprints…

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.686
Damn, Fatty, answer your phone!

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:37.564
Security footage from the parking lot
where the victim was last seen

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:40.776
shows that the suspect
even disguised himself as the victim

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:43.237
and drove his car away from the scene.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.782
Police are now investigating
the victim's social circle…

00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:01.171
Don't.

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:03.173
Don't.

00:15:04.758 --> 00:15:05.801
Don't!

00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:08.762
Don't.

00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:15.978
Don't.

00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:17.730
Don't.

00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.191
Fuck! Go away!

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.906
What the hell?

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:22.336
Hey, what is this?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.338
What are you doing?

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:25.839
-What's up?
-Darling.

00:16:26.423 --> 00:16:27.257
Darling.

00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:30.636
I got a Buddha here, especially for you,

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:33.639
and asked my sisters to perform a ritual
to cleanse your bad karma.

00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:36.266
Hope things will go more smoothly for you.

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:40.104
-You're cleansing my bad karma?
-Yes.

00:16:40.187 --> 00:16:41.688
You're doing a ritual for me?

00:16:41.772 --> 00:16:42.773
Hey.

00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:44.316
You spent quite a lot of money.

00:16:45.818 --> 00:16:48.237
Fucking hell, what bad karma?

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:50.781
You think I had it coming, don't you?

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:52.449
-That I asked for all this?
-No.

00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:53.784
What do you mean?

00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:56.578
Your mom is doing this for your sake.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:58.622
-It's okay.
-How can you say that to her?

00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:01.083
Hey.

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.086
She's my mom, not yours.

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:07.422
I'm fucking talking to her.
How is this your business?

00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:08.882
Get out.

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:11.093
Now! At once!

00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:12.594
Please go home. I'm sorry.

00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:13.637
-Don't.
-What?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.763
Darling, don't.

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:16.140
I'm sorry.

00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:17.141
It's all my fault.

00:17:17.224 --> 00:17:19.935
I'm sorry. You're right. It's my fault.

00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:22.062
You don't even know what you did wrong!

00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:23.772
I've told you hundreds of times.

00:17:24.523 --> 00:17:26.817
Did you hear me? Did you?

00:17:27.317 --> 00:17:28.569
You didn't?

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:29.486
Fine.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.696
Fine, here.

00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:35.159
Here, be careful.

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:36.285
No!

00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:49.464
Hey, what fucking good
does praying all day do?

00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:52.134
Why don't you ask that old man to help?

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:53.594
Beg him.

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:55.387
The moment he asks,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.641
who among the cops
or criminals wouldn't help?

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:02.936
Who wouldn't help me catch Li Jen-yao?

00:18:03.437 --> 00:18:06.190
It's just a simple phone call.

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:08.650
And you can help me. Why won't you do it?

00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:10.694
Why won't you do it?

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:18.410
Buddha.

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:20.162
I'm sorry.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.248
I'm sorry.

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:25.542
I'm sorry.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:28.921
Please forgive my son.

00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:31.965
He didn't mean to disrespect you.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:34.051
He's really not a bad kid.

00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:36.428
He just lost himself for a moment.

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:38.472
-Buddha, please forgive him.
-Fuck.

00:18:38.555 --> 00:18:40.849
-I'm talking to you.
-For everything he did to you.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.976
I'm sorry, Buddha.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.519
Please forgive my son.

00:18:44.603 --> 00:18:47.272
-Buddha, please…
-I'm talking to you!

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:52.486
Buddha, he just lost himself for a moment.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.614
Buddha, I'm sorry. Please forgive my son.

00:18:55.697 --> 00:18:58.450
Why the hell are you apologizing
to a piece of wood?

00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:00.744
He didn't mean to disrespect you.

00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:02.788
Mom!

00:19:02.871 --> 00:19:05.582
I'm talking to you. Look at me, okay?

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.501
Look at me! Open your eyes and look!

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:09.836
Mom!

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.880
-Listen to me, okay?
-He's not a bad kid.

00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:12.839
Listen to me!

00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:14.132
-Please forgive him.
-Mom!

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:16.385
It's really no trouble at all.

00:19:17.302 --> 00:19:21.640
And no one's happier than me
to be by Hsiao-tung's side, okay?

00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:24.768
Her colleagues came by yesterday.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:26.103
Yeah.

00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.690
Oh, okay, no problem.

00:19:29.773 --> 00:19:30.857
Go ahead, Mr. Chiang.

00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:33.318
Okay. Let's talk when you come over.

00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:35.570
Okay, all right.

00:19:35.654 --> 00:19:37.072
Okay, bye.

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:14.568
So is this your look now?

00:20:17.112 --> 00:20:19.364
I quite like it.

00:20:20.824 --> 00:20:21.950
Who are you?

00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:27.122
Whatever.

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.374
This isn't the first time anyway.

00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:33.503
I'll tell you for the last time.

00:20:33.587 --> 00:20:35.047
Listen carefully.

00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:39.134
I'm your best friend, Chi-chi.

00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:40.052
Chi-chi.

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:43.221
Please don't forget me again, okay?

00:20:43.722 --> 00:20:45.932
It's so awkward
to introduce myself every time.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.020
Do you know who I am?

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:52.564
Do you know what happened to me?

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.816
You're sure you wanna ask that?

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.445
That's a long story.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:00.364
Let me think.

00:21:04.743 --> 00:21:07.579
Ask her the question you just asked me.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.623
She's much more patient than I am.

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:14.044
She can talk to you for a long time.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.634
I'll hand her over to you.

00:21:42.739 --> 00:21:45.450
Why are you suddenly awake? Are you okay?

00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:49.496
Who are you?

00:21:52.124 --> 00:21:53.500
Who am I?

00:22:01.883 --> 00:22:03.009
I'm Shen Mu.

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:05.470
Shen Mu?

00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:06.805
Yes.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.977
Why are you here?

00:22:14.354 --> 00:22:15.439
I…

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.450
I am

00:22:27.075 --> 00:22:28.410
your family.

00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:31.455
My family?

00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:35.625
Yes.

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:38.545
I'm your family.

00:23:08.158 --> 00:23:09.326
That's right.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.661
I'm your family.

00:23:13.163 --> 00:23:14.956
No matter what happens in the future,

00:23:15.957 --> 00:23:17.751
I'll never leave you again.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.546
We're family.

00:23:39.272 --> 00:23:40.357
JEFF: IS THIS YOU?

00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.203
How's the search going?

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:57.832
Jung-tai's scandal has blown up.
The school told him to lie low.

00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.751
He's been missing for a while.

00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:03.338
I can't reach Meng-hung either.

00:24:04.548 --> 00:24:06.591
And I just found out

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.386
that En-ya has been missing for days too.

00:24:10.095 --> 00:24:11.763
Her assistant called the police.

00:24:12.264 --> 00:24:14.099
Not to mention Wei-ting and Che-li.

00:24:15.225 --> 00:24:16.851
Fuck, why is it us?

00:24:22.023 --> 00:24:23.316
Fucking hell!

00:24:27.529 --> 00:24:28.488
Do you think

00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:31.324
Chiang Hsiao-tung
has become a malevolent spirit

00:24:31.408 --> 00:24:32.742
and came back for revenge?

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.662
How the hell is this

00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:38.164
related to Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:42.127
Well, didn't people say
that she killed herself?

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.129
It'd make sense if she wanted to haunt us.

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:46.590
Listen.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.174
I heard some ghosts

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:52.512
hold a Black Command Flag to seek revenge
so that those who hurt them die horribly.

00:24:53.513 --> 00:24:55.223
Look at how Che-li and Wei-ting died.

00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:57.601
It's Li Jen-yao.

00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:00.604
It must be him.

00:25:01.938 --> 00:25:02.939
Li Jen-yao?

00:25:03.898 --> 00:25:05.150
Has he been released?

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.319
He's been out for a year.

00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:10.989
He's out,
yet we can't find any trace of him.

00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:14.534
Someone must be covering his tracks.

00:25:15.785 --> 00:25:16.661
No way.

00:25:17.162 --> 00:25:18.747
He's been out for a year.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.956
Why wait until now?

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:22.917
Does he love Hsiao-tung that much?

00:25:23.418 --> 00:25:25.629
That can't be. Is he crazy?

00:25:27.172 --> 00:25:28.048
Ti.

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:31.468
Tsai Wen-ling is here.

00:25:38.683 --> 00:25:40.101
Why didn't you keep your word?

00:25:41.728 --> 00:25:44.439
Didn't you say
that if I behaved and took clients,

00:25:44.522 --> 00:25:46.232
you'd destroy the video?

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:49.319
Why did you upload it?

00:25:51.655 --> 00:25:53.782
Tell the police if you have the guts.

00:25:54.908 --> 00:25:56.451
Cuff me.

00:25:57.827 --> 00:25:58.662
Come on.

00:25:58.745 --> 00:26:01.498
You didn't get that many views.

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:04.334
It's been several weeks
since I uploaded it.

00:26:05.168 --> 00:26:07.087
Just about 10,000 people have watched it.

00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:08.713
Honey,

00:26:10.173 --> 00:26:13.343
if you can make every man on the street

00:26:14.052 --> 00:26:15.720
recognize you,

00:26:17.305 --> 00:26:19.683
I will give you a performance bonus.

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:23.645
Hey, if you need money, come to me.

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:25.855
I'll pay you 50 for each blow job.

00:26:27.023 --> 00:26:29.192
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Don't cross the line!

00:26:39.661 --> 00:26:40.495
Come on.

00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:43.039
Here.

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.501
You have only one chance.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.630
If you don't kill me…

00:26:53.049 --> 00:26:54.426
I'll kill you.

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:51.357
It's been several weeks
since I uploaded it.

00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:53.568
Just about 10,000 people have watched it.

00:27:54.277 --> 00:27:57.614
If you can make every man on the street

00:27:57.697 --> 00:27:59.032
recognize you,

00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:01.493
I will give you a performance bonus.

00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:51.459
I was wondering if you have news
about Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.836
Lately…

00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:55.213
lately, I keep

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.467
seeing her in front of me
wearing her high school uniform.

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:02.512
The unidentified body parts
found in Yilan days ago

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:05.557
have been confirmed through DNA matching

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.935
as belonging to Chen, an engineer
reported missing by his family last month.

00:29:09.018 --> 00:29:11.271
Police say that near the crime scene…

00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:13.314
But I heard she committed suicide.

00:29:13.898 --> 00:29:15.984
I want to confirm if that's true or not.

00:29:18.152 --> 00:29:19.612
If that's true,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.489
what exactly did I see?

00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:40.800
I'm sorry.

00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:43.344
I'm sorry.

00:29:44.387 --> 00:29:45.555
I'm sorry!

00:29:47.348 --> 00:29:48.558
I'm sorry!

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:54.314
I'm sorry.

00:29:55.106 --> 00:29:55.940
I'm sorry.

00:29:59.777 --> 00:30:01.279
Kidney Bean, look, I bought you…

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.008
Young master.

00:30:23.468 --> 00:30:24.969
It's been a long time.

00:30:25.637 --> 00:30:27.221
What the hell are you doing?

00:30:28.514 --> 00:30:30.266
You're scaring my wife and kid.

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:40.693
After all, I used to work for your dad.

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:43.696
I helped you a lot too.

00:30:44.447 --> 00:30:47.450
Can't we talk about this?

00:30:53.998 --> 00:30:55.833
Big K, we can't hide it anymore.

00:30:56.417 --> 00:30:57.752
Young master's investigating.

00:30:58.252 --> 00:31:01.673
I could get by if he only asked
a thing or two when it crossed his mind.

00:31:02.173 --> 00:31:03.383
But the way he's going,

00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:06.094
he'll soon find out
that you're hiding Li Jen-yao.

00:31:06.177 --> 00:31:08.221
Sorry for all the trouble.

00:31:09.639 --> 00:31:12.892
I don't mean to ditch you,
but at this rate, I'll be screwed too.

00:31:12.976 --> 00:31:13.810
As your buddy,

00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:16.479
I can only tell you to lie low for now.

00:31:16.562 --> 00:31:18.147
Don't let him catch you.

00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:20.108
Otherwise, we're dead meat.

00:31:28.366 --> 00:31:29.450
Big K.

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.744
Where's my classmate?

00:31:31.828 --> 00:31:33.162
Where are you hiding him?

00:31:34.122 --> 00:31:35.456
Tell me, come on.

00:31:36.582 --> 00:31:37.709
Young master.

00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:39.961
You got it wrong.

00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:43.089
I'm not hiding Li Jen-yao.

00:31:43.798 --> 00:31:45.591
I'm helping your dad

00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:48.636
so that he doesn't bury his own son.

00:31:52.598 --> 00:31:53.433
You…

00:31:55.351 --> 00:31:57.603
Do you know
how many people have died so far?

00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:00.857
You do.

00:32:01.357 --> 00:32:02.400
So you're scared.

00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:05.319
You'd better pray
Li Jen-yao doesn't find you first.

00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:06.738
He's different now.

00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:07.780
This time,

00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:09.782
he won't spare you.

00:32:14.162 --> 00:32:15.788
You're dead.

00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:27.467
Fuck!

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.263
Hey, fuck. He's gone.

00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:33.973
What should we do now?

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:43.983
It hurts.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:45.068
Just hang on.

00:32:46.903 --> 00:32:47.737
Hello?

00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:49.280
Hey, it's me.

00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:50.990
What's up?

00:32:51.574 --> 00:32:53.201
-Kidney Bean.
-Nothing.

00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:54.619
I've really let you down.

00:32:58.289 --> 00:33:00.792
Well, for the sake of my wife and kid,

00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:01.876
I sold you out.

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:03.836
We're protecting different things.

00:33:04.337 --> 00:33:05.713
Just take care of your family.

00:33:05.797 --> 00:33:07.090
You really want to do this?

00:33:07.173 --> 00:33:10.093
If so, make sure
you hide Chiang Hsiao-tung well.

00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:12.053
If Ouyang Ti catches her, you're screwed.

00:33:12.678 --> 00:33:16.724
Don't think he won't find out just because
she changed her name and appearance.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:19.977
He has a lot of tricks.
He has many ways to figure it out.

00:33:21.145 --> 00:33:22.438
I'll be honest with you.

00:33:24.273 --> 00:33:25.733
About six or seven years ago…

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:29.946
when Hsiao-tung was in the hospital,

00:33:31.197 --> 00:33:32.448
I went to visit.

00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:39.956
Do you guys think

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.793
that apologizing now

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.462
and paying us this money

00:33:47.088 --> 00:33:48.756
will bring my daughter back?

00:33:50.341 --> 00:33:51.175
Impossible.

00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:56.389
She'll never come back.

00:33:56.472 --> 00:34:00.518
I never told you
because I felt like you both had it rough.

00:34:01.018 --> 00:34:03.771
I wanted you two to go live your own lives

00:34:03.855 --> 00:34:05.398
and not get mixed up again.

00:34:06.774 --> 00:34:08.276
But I was wrong.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.153
I shouldn't have decided

00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:11.863
for you.

00:34:14.532 --> 00:34:15.408
No.

00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:16.576
You're right.

00:34:17.243 --> 00:34:18.786
I shouldn't have gone to her.

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:20.955
She'd be better off

00:34:21.998 --> 00:34:23.166
without me.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.710
If the police come to you,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.461
don't blab.

00:34:29.005 --> 00:34:30.590
Don't mention the past.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.466
Especially about Hsiao-tung.

00:34:33.134 --> 00:34:34.886
-Otherwise--
-Okay, I got it.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.554
I have principles, okay?

00:34:36.637 --> 00:34:37.972
And you? Where are you?

00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:39.765
Can I help with anything?

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.727
Hello? Hey.

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:47.023
Delete it.

00:34:47.523 --> 00:34:49.442
Otherwise, I'll sue your ass.

00:34:49.942 --> 00:34:51.068
REPORT

00:34:56.073 --> 00:34:57.450
Why are there more?

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.619
She was forced to do it.

00:34:59.702 --> 00:35:02.246
The person who filmed this is a scumbag.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.374
Delete the video.

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:06.751
Otherwise,

00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:11.088
I'll sue all of your asses.

00:35:12.423 --> 00:35:14.217
WE WILL REMOVE VIOLATING CONTENT, OKAY

00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:16.427
Why are there more?

00:35:17.053 --> 00:35:18.387
Why are there more?

00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.306
Why can't I delete them all?

00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:21.807
Why me?

00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:23.267
Hurry, delete them.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.404
Right.

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:36.948
Why?

00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:40.910
You knew what would happen.

00:35:41.494 --> 00:35:43.162
I asked you to call the police

00:35:43.663 --> 00:35:44.997
and help me.

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:47.124
Why did you ignore me?

00:35:47.208 --> 00:35:48.834
Hurry, help me.

00:35:50.294 --> 00:35:52.129
Help me.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:58.803
Why did you side with them
when you knew what happened to me

00:35:59.929 --> 00:36:01.389
and said everything

00:36:01.889 --> 00:36:03.307
was my fault?

00:36:03.808 --> 00:36:06.644
What exactly happened that day?

00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:13.442
At the time,

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:17.321
I told Hsiao-tung it was dangerous there
and asked her to leave with me,

00:36:17.822 --> 00:36:18.823
but she said no.

00:36:18.906 --> 00:36:20.950
She wanted to stay and hang out with them.

00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:21.867
Really?

00:36:22.868 --> 00:36:25.746
Before I left,
I even saw her hug Ouyang Ti willingly.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:31.085
-I'm sorry.
-Why did you do that to me?

00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:32.128
I'm sorry.

00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:35.548
Aren't we friends?

00:36:41.554 --> 00:36:42.388
I'm sorry.

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.895
It's okay.

00:36:51.522 --> 00:36:52.606
Back then,

00:36:53.107 --> 00:36:54.608
you left me there.

00:36:56.068 --> 00:36:59.947
But I'll always stay by your side.

00:37:04.452 --> 00:37:05.661
I will always,

00:37:06.412 --> 00:37:09.373
always

00:37:10.166 --> 00:37:11.584
be watching you.

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:13.669
Watching you.

00:37:20.384 --> 00:37:24.930
I'm sorry.

00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:30.853
I plan to bring my family
to the US to hide out for a while.

00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:32.438
Like a vacation.

00:37:36.233 --> 00:37:37.068
Hey.

00:37:37.818 --> 00:37:38.694
Fatty.

00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:40.821
Are you kidding me?

00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:46.827
I'm serious, okay?

00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:48.287
I'm not like you.

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:50.247
Why risk my life over someone like that?

00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:51.791
I am my dad's only son.

00:37:51.874 --> 00:37:52.958
I'm the only son.

00:37:55.294 --> 00:37:56.253
Only son?

00:37:56.337 --> 00:37:59.340
Oh, I forgot you're the only son.

00:37:59.924 --> 00:38:01.884
Take good care of yourself.

00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:05.471
I'm sorry.
I forgot you hate your half-brother.

00:38:05.554 --> 00:38:07.765
Fuck you.

00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:09.683
Fuck off.

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:12.311
-I will. To the US.
-Don't come back or I'll beat you.

00:38:12.395 --> 00:38:13.479
Don't mind him.

00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:16.148
Don't look at him.

00:38:16.774 --> 00:38:17.858
Hey, Wang Yu-hsiang.

00:39:21.213 --> 00:39:23.007
Can we go out for a walk?

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.217
I'm so bored with staying at home
every day.

00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:26.135
I'm gonna die.

00:39:28.012 --> 00:39:30.681
Let's go out for dinner later, then.

00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:35.561
Really?

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.980
I'll go get changed.

00:39:38.564 --> 00:39:39.398
Don't fool me.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.698
What do you want to eat later?

00:39:48.407 --> 00:39:50.618
Let's grab some hot pot
after checking out the lights.

00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:51.535
Sure.

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:52.828
What kind of hot pot?

00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:55.623
Anything works.

00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:57.291
-Spicy hot pot?
-Sure.

00:39:57.374 --> 00:39:59.084
-I haven't had it for ages.
-I see.

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.377
It's so beautiful.

00:41:28.173 --> 00:41:29.925
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:31.552
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

00:41:36.432 --> 00:41:37.933
Merry Christmas.

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:41.103
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.187
Hey, let me.

00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:46.150
It's so cute.

00:41:49.028 --> 00:41:50.195
You look cute too.

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:01.206
I've already asked my men to look into it.

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:05.461
I'm sure
someone Li Jen-yao knows lives there.

00:42:05.544 --> 00:42:07.504
And my gut tells me

00:42:08.714 --> 00:42:10.382
it could be his woman.

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:14.928
We'll find her, no matter what.

00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:18.140
Catch her and mess her up.

00:42:19.933 --> 00:42:22.144
We'll film everything

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:24.188
and show it to Li Jen-yao.

00:42:27.524 --> 00:42:28.692
Hey, only son.

00:42:29.193 --> 00:42:30.402
Listen.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.739
This time, I'll definitely make Li…

00:42:56.595 --> 00:42:57.596
Hello?

00:42:58.222 --> 00:42:59.056
Ouyang.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.064
Fatty.

00:43:10.234 --> 00:43:11.068
Fatty.

00:43:11.902 --> 00:43:13.070
Fatty.

00:43:14.655 --> 00:43:16.031
-Ouyang.
-Fatty, save me.

00:43:16.615 --> 00:43:17.950
Ouyang, say something.

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:19.785
Fatty.

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:22.663
Fatty.

00:43:22.746 --> 00:43:23.872
Save me.

00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:44.309
Darling, are you home?

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:45.519
Why are the lights off?

00:43:54.278 --> 00:43:55.362
Darling.

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:56.739
Darling.

00:43:57.239 --> 00:43:58.532
I'm home.

00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:01.345
What's wrong?

00:45:03.263 --> 00:45:05.724
I remembered something important.

00:45:11.396 --> 00:45:15.150
I promised
to spend Christmas with someone.

00:45:47.474 --> 00:45:51.019
I waited for them a long, long time
at the place we agreed to meet.

00:45:53.146 --> 00:45:54.106
They didn't come.

00:45:56.316 --> 00:45:58.443
I only remember
feeling disappointed at the end.

00:45:59.945 --> 00:46:01.363
And now…

00:46:05.242 --> 00:46:07.578
I can't remember who they are.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.836
Why don't I remember who they are?

00:46:19.715 --> 00:46:21.884
How can I not remember?

00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:09.744
