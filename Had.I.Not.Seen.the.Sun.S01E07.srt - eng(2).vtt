00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.122
Please tell me.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.332
Is this all true?

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:22.293
Chiang Hsiao-tung…

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:24.504
Hey, Pin-yu.

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:30.260
Pin-yu.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.688
Didn't we agree that we'd keep this

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:44.607
a secret?

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:18.243
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:58.574
When did you get back?

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:00.660
Yesterday.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:04.580
Didn't Pin-yu say
you were staying in Taichung for a while?

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:11.754
TO LI JEN-YAO

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.053
1027.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.434
You've got mail.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.040
TA-WEI

00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:49.125
Hey, where are you?

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.793
Ta-wei, I'm sorry.

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:52.295
I overslept.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:53.338
You overslept?

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:54.464
Yeah.

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:58.885
I'm not feeling well.
I didn't sleep well last night.

00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.430
Whatever. It's no use scolding you now.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.975
There's a lot to do at the office today.
Just get here quickly.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.107
She really is sick.

00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.567
Is something wrong?

00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:16.611
Nothing.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.156
She said something about oversleeping.
She'll be here soon.

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:25.119
Listen, I've got something to do.
I have to go.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:29.457
Tell her to take a look
at the videos here for me.

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.250
Where are you going?

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:37.423
I… have a meeting with Li Jen-yao.

00:04:37.507 --> 00:04:40.802
Li Jen-yao?
Didn't he say he wouldn't see you anymore?

00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:42.887
That's right. But guess what?

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:45.181
I wrote him a letter after that.

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:48.059
I specifically mentioned
"Chiang Hsiao-tung" in it.

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:50.061
And he changed his mind.

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:51.229
Why?

00:04:51.312 --> 00:04:53.106
I want to know why too.

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:54.440
All right.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.692
-I'm leaving.
-Wait.

00:04:58.152 --> 00:04:59.737
I have something to tell you.

00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:03.074
When you were in Taichung,
I received a call.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:08.121
Someone heard that you're making a film
about Li Jen-yao and wants to invest.

00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:09.205
What?

00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:11.999
But there's a condition.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:18.172
They want to hear directly from Li Jen-yao
in the film about why he killed their son.

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:21.717
Who is it?

00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:25.346
The mother of one of Li Jen-yao's victims,
Ouyang Ti.

00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:38.860
Thank you for meeting with me.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.363
I'm here just to tell you that,

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:44.949
regardless of what you decide to do,

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.577
I will no longer assist
in making this documentary.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.954
I know that.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.001
That's why I specifically wrote
to tell you that,

00:05:55.668 --> 00:05:58.629
to complete this documentary,

00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:01.549
I believe

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:04.719
I need to find someone else
to tell the story for you.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.264
Hold on.

00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:16.939
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.566
Does she fit the bill?

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:27.366
Based on your expression,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.660
I think I've found the right person.

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:32.663
Recently, I went to Taichung

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:36.918
and interviewed Chiang Hsiao-tung's
high school classmates and teachers.

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:39.587
Thanks to what you did in the past,

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:41.214
they all know of you

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:42.924
and remember you.

00:06:43.424 --> 00:06:45.426
When they spoke of you,

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:48.095
there wasn't one nice word.

00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:51.432
But when I mentioned Chiang Hsiao-tung…

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:54.894
it was completely different.

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:58.105
Hsiao-tung was the most optimistic girl
I've ever met.

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:01.234
Even though I'm also a dancer,

00:07:01.317 --> 00:07:03.110
every time I saw her dance,

00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:05.029
I couldn't help but be drawn in.

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.073
Even though so many years have passed,

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:10.493
they not only remember her…

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:13.037
When we were classmates,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.289
I rarely saw her get mad at anyone

00:07:15.373 --> 00:07:17.083
or say bad things about anyone.

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:20.711
…but also say repeatedly

00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:23.756
what a great girl Chiang Hsiao-tung was

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.467
and what a special girl she was.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:31.556
They can easily recall
interesting moments they had with her.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.310
Chiang Hsiao-tung was the most talented
and hardworking student I've ever taught.

00:07:36.394 --> 00:07:37.853
When they spoke of her…

00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:39.272
She was made for the stage.

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:42.149
…they had smiles on their faces as if

00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:44.694
she were still with them.

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:48.114
They told those stories as if

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.032
they happened yesterday,

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:51.951
the day before,

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:54.245
or just a while ago.

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:56.706
Everything seemed so recent.

00:07:58.457 --> 00:08:00.167
And only when I asked

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:02.753
about what happened
to Chiang Hsiao-tung later

00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:04.714
did they quiet down.

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:07.842
They were speechless for a long time.

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:10.177
That kind of silence

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.431
is something I've seen countless times.

00:08:26.402 --> 00:08:28.404
I know better than anyone else

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:31.115
the meaning

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.118
behind that kind of silence.

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:45.504
There is one thing

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:49.050
that I find extremely odd.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.054
When I asked about
your relationship with Chiang Hsiao-tung,

00:08:53.554 --> 00:08:54.847
not a single person knew.

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:59.435
They all said
they'd never seen you with her at school.

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:02.313
And no one noticed
if you two had ever crossed paths.

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:08.194
By the way…

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:14.325
that video of Chiang Hsiao-tung
on the Internet…

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:16.827
Have you watched it?

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:20.915
Gosh.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.875
You have watched it.

00:09:24.043 --> 00:09:25.878
Damn, to be honest,

00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:27.463
if I were her boyfriend,

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:30.716
I'd fucking kill those people
without hesitation, you know?

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:41.769
Who filmed that video?

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:44.021
Who pushed her over the edge?

00:09:44.897 --> 00:09:47.191
What I really fucking want to know is,

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:50.403
why nobody at school realized
you and Chiang Hsiao-tung knew each other,

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.864
even though you two were so close.

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:55.783
You didn't say a word either.

00:09:58.953 --> 00:09:59.870
Gosh.

00:10:01.247 --> 00:10:02.581
You two were together, right?

00:10:03.457 --> 00:10:07.420
How much did you know
about what happened to Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:10:07.503 --> 00:10:09.964
If you knew about these things…

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:13.050
Hey, did you ever consider
taking revenge for her?

00:10:15.344 --> 00:10:16.470
Did you do it?

00:10:27.648 --> 00:10:28.774
I admit

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:32.319
I did know Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.789
The Chiang Hsiao-tung I knew
wasn't that kind of girl.

00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:46.041
But anyone who has watched that video
would recognize

00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:49.295
that the girl in it
is Chiang Hsiao-tung, no doubt.

00:10:50.087 --> 00:10:51.505
-I can't believe it.
-I'm back.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.719
So? How's your progress?

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.721
Not bad.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.350
The information on Chiang Hsiao-tung
is fairly well-organized.

00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:07.855
Ta-wei.

00:11:08.647 --> 00:11:09.648
What about you?

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.067
I heard from Chien

00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:14.320
that you went
to interview Li Jen-yao today.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.159
Li Jen-yao?

00:11:21.076 --> 00:11:23.037
He told me he knew Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:11:24.413 --> 00:11:25.247
What did he say?

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:28.459
He said

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:30.461
he did know Chiang Hsiao-tung,

00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:32.880
but not in the way I thought.

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:36.300
He said that Chiang Hsiao-tung

00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:38.177
was his girlfriend's close friend.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:44.600
His girlfriend's close friend?

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:45.518
Yeah.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.062
He said it was a girl in his class called

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.065
Lai Yun-chen.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:55.778
He said they violated school rules
because they were dating

00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.446
and were given demerits.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.158
They even wrote
an apology letter or pledge.

00:12:02.076 --> 00:12:03.452
Really?

00:12:03.953 --> 00:12:05.079
How could this be?

00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:06.664
Of course I didn't believe it.

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:09.750
Fuck, I even called
their instructor at the time

00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:12.211
to confirm if it was true.

00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:14.964
He actually told me it was.

00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:16.882
The instructor also said

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:19.051
that he still has the pledge
they wrote back then.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.804
Damn that old goat.

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:24.473
He kept this important information
from me until now.

00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:30.938
I wasted a lot of time
going down numerous dead ends.

00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:33.440
Ta-wei,

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:37.194
so do you believe what Li Jen-yao said?

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:41.073
That he had nothing to do with
what happened to Chiang Hsiao-tung?

00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:45.536
How's that possible?

00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:47.913
Here, look.

00:12:48.414 --> 00:12:50.457
How many times have I filmed Li Jen-yao?

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:54.628
Wouldn't I know if he's telling the truth?

00:12:57.423 --> 00:12:58.716
In my opinion,

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:03.095
the relationship between Li Jen-yao
and Chiang Hsiao-tung

00:13:03.178 --> 00:13:05.431
was definitely not as simple
as he claimed.

00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:09.476
He must still be hiding

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.270
something more important from me.

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:17.735
2007

00:14:07.242 --> 00:14:09.745
Thanks. I'll drink it later.
I want to practice some more.

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:11.872
What's there to practice?

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:15.334
You're for sure doing the solo
in the end-of-semester show.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:16.835
You're thinking too far ahead.

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:20.047
What's going on?
Why are you suddenly pushing so hard?

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.509
I'm not. I promised someone.
I don't want to disappoint them.

00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:26.136
Who don't you want to disappoint?

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.054
Your boyfriend?

00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:28.722
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:14:28.806 --> 00:14:30.015
-Who's dating?
-No.

00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:31.308
-You didn't say anything.
-No.

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:33.102
-Stop it.
-You didn't tell us--

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:34.144
Fuck!

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:35.437
Are you an idiot?

00:14:35.938 --> 00:14:39.358
I just bought this pressed powder.
How can I use it if you've broken it?

00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:40.317
I'm sorry.

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:42.820
Do I have to forgive you
just because you apologized?

00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:44.655
-Are you asking for a beating?
-So mean.

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:57.167
What are you looking at? Idiot.

00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:29.616
Kid, can you do this?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.160
No problem. I've got this.

00:15:31.243 --> 00:15:35.122
If it's no problem, then move faster.
There's a lot more to unload from the car.

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:36.623
Hurry up.

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:38.000
Okay.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:46.717
Kid, good work.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.218
This is your pay for today.

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:49.595
Thank you.

00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:52.097
-Remember to show up on time tomorrow.
-Okay.

00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:10.949
Jen-yao, where are you?

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:12.618
Come home soon, will you?

00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:14.703
I've taken care of everything.

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:18.624
We'll talk when you get home.
Don't make me worry.

00:16:22.753 --> 00:16:24.129
Then write "trash."

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:26.090
And write "useless."

00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:27.424
You know how to write it?

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:31.595
Fucking idiot. You wrote "Li Wang-yao"
instead of "Li Jen-yao." Idiot.

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:33.138
-I'll write "trash."
-Go ahead.

00:16:33.222 --> 00:16:35.057
Shit, what are you writing?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.477
I'm making the middle stroke
thicker and longer, like mine, got it?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.479
At least 31 centimeters.

00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:41.396
I'll jizz here.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.109
Fuck, no! He sits close to me.
I don't wanna smell… Put it away! Idiot!

00:16:45.192 --> 00:16:47.736
-Why don't you jizz too?
-Fuck, so tiny.

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:52.699
Hey, I really admire Ouyang sometimes.
He's amazing.

00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:55.577
As soon as he made his move,
he got that bastard kicked out.

00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:58.330
Damn, but honestly, the way it ended

00:16:58.413 --> 00:17:00.582
feels like a fucking shame to me,
you know?

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:02.918
-It's not fun enough.
-What else, then?

00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:06.880
If you want to keep messing with him,
just bring him back and continue the fun.

00:17:07.714 --> 00:17:09.133
Great.

00:17:09.216 --> 00:17:10.384
How do we bring him back?

00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:31.131
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:33.133
Charges will apply after the beep.

00:19:43.203 --> 00:19:44.579
Who's the real trash here?

00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:48.041
You are.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.634
Why are you here?

00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.267
It's okay.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.352
I don't care what they say.

00:20:11.773 --> 00:20:12.607
Thank you.

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:16.236
I didn't come here just to clean.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.488
I happened to be passing by,
and my OCD kicked in,

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:20.240
so I thought I'd scrub it clean.

00:20:33.128 --> 00:20:34.880
It's really windy today.

00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:36.882
It got blown over just now.

00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:40.969
It's true.

00:20:57.194 --> 00:20:58.320
Where are you going next?

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:01.490
Call Jung-tai.
See if they're done playing ball.

00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:03.408
If they are, come hang out at my place.

00:21:04.076 --> 00:21:06.119
Hey, isn't that your girl?

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:10.082
Why is she with Li Jen-yao?

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:11.625
Wei-ting,

00:21:12.417 --> 00:21:13.335
shut up.

00:21:24.429 --> 00:21:25.263
Let's go.

00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:28.183
Okay.

00:21:31.353 --> 00:21:33.897
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:48.703
Jen-yao, you're back.

00:21:48.787 --> 00:21:51.206
I thought I'd go to Taipei
in a few days to look for you.

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:54.876
Mom, take this money.

00:21:55.544 --> 00:21:58.797
Take care of yourself.
I'll be staying in Taipei from now on.

00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:00.757
I'll visit you when I have time.

00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:03.135
Jen-yao, actually…

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.347
Whether you come back is your business.

00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:09.683
Just don't worry about her finances

00:22:09.766 --> 00:22:11.893
because my debt is settled.

00:22:12.394 --> 00:22:13.520
Take it back.

00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:16.731
Here.

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:30.203
It's true.

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.832
We don't have to hide
from debt collectors anymore.

00:22:38.378 --> 00:22:39.254
OCEAN DRAGON SEAFOOD

00:22:39.337 --> 00:22:42.132
Your dad went to Taipei
to borrow money from a friend.

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:46.553
He used the money to place a bet and won.

00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:48.847
Well,

00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:52.976
the winnings were just enough
to pay off our debt.

00:22:53.768 --> 00:22:57.063
Your dad talked things out
with Big K a few days ago.

00:22:57.564 --> 00:22:59.274
He won't harass us anymore.

00:23:00.317 --> 00:23:02.611
Only then did I call you
and ask you to come back.

00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:10.410
Is it really all paid off?

00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:11.745
Yeah.

00:23:12.454 --> 00:23:14.289
We even got the promissory note back.

00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:15.665
Jen-yao.

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:18.835
Move back home, will you?

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.716
I know.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.469
We have really disappointed you.

00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:32.015
But your dad has really changed this time.

00:23:32.098 --> 00:23:35.227
He's working again.
He took a job in carpentry.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.812
His former boss is willing
to give him another chance.

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:39.856
He's also drinking less now.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.818
Trust me.
Your dad has really changed this time.

00:23:47.531 --> 00:23:48.573
Yeah?

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:49.824
Mom.

00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:53.411
I don't want to talk about him anymore.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.551
Congratulations!

00:24:08.134 --> 00:24:09.344
Here.

00:24:09.427 --> 00:24:12.222
Hey, today, I was going to ask someone

00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:14.766
to slaughter a pig
and send it to you to celebrate.

00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:16.893
Tough times end.

00:24:16.977 --> 00:24:19.104
Good times follow.

00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:20.981
I can't believe I ran into you two here.

00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:23.817
Let me make a toast to you two.
Hey, pour each of them a drink.

00:24:25.569 --> 00:24:26.653
Damn!

00:24:26.736 --> 00:24:27.696
I almost forgot.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.282
You're not old enough to drink yet.

00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:32.534
Never mind, kids shouldn't drink. Ma'am.

00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:34.953
Here's to you.

00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:37.372
From now on, when you see me,

00:24:37.455 --> 00:24:40.792
you don't have to run so fast
like you're flying away.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.211
I can't believe it.

00:24:43.295 --> 00:24:45.630
Your husband is really incredible.

00:24:45.714 --> 00:24:47.299
He could pay off the debt.

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:49.718
Impressive!

00:24:49.801 --> 00:24:51.845
Here, cheers to you. Congratulations.

00:25:02.272 --> 00:25:03.106
Ma'am.

00:25:04.232 --> 00:25:06.026
I've finished my drink.

00:25:06.693 --> 00:25:08.069
Why aren't you drinking?

00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:11.114
Are you trying to embarrass me?

00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:26.963
Mom, let's go home.

00:25:27.547 --> 00:25:28.506
Kiddo.

00:25:31.843 --> 00:25:34.054
Honestly, I've always admired you.

00:25:34.554 --> 00:25:36.264
I want to take you under my wing.

00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:38.475
Too bad.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.018
It's not meant to be.

00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:58.536
Mom.

00:26:00.747 --> 00:26:02.624
-Later, I'll--
-You aren't full, are you?

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:05.919
Let me cook noodles for you at home.

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:07.837
We have really fresh oysters.

00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:10.924
We also have white shrimp.

00:26:11.007 --> 00:26:13.301
White shrimp is your favorite, right?

00:26:13.927 --> 00:26:15.512
Why don't I cook them for you?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.314
Okay.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.389
Hello?

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:46.019
Where am I?
I'm getting high at the secret base.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.520
Yes.

00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:49.147
Yeah.

00:27:49.731 --> 00:27:50.648
You want to come?

00:27:51.733 --> 00:27:52.942
Come straight here.

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:54.402
Yeah. Okay.

00:28:00.366 --> 00:28:02.577
Here, eat this. For a balanced diet.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.170
Hello? Young master.

00:28:12.253 --> 00:28:16.007
Hey, it's me. My friend's coming.
Get a runner to replenish my stock.

00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:19.344
Nah, it's not a good time.

00:28:19.427 --> 00:28:21.095
Fuck, I didn't ask you to bring it!

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:23.181
Send a lackey.
What are you bitching about?

00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:24.432
That's not it.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:27.185
You're the boss's son.
I wouldn't dare disrespect you.

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:31.648
Nah, it's because a runner was caught
by the police just yesterday.

00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:34.192
They're now looking into
who he's working for.

00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:37.821
That's why I'm asking you to wait
until things calm down.

00:28:37.904 --> 00:28:39.280
I don't give a fuck that…

00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:46.496
Fuck.

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.207
I won't get dragged in, right?

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.416
Relax.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.962
I've taught my guys
not to run their mouths.

00:28:56.256 --> 00:28:57.382
My dad…

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:00.760
How much does my dad know?

00:29:00.844 --> 00:29:01.886
Does he know I use?

00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:04.597
I didn't tell your dad.

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.225
But if something happens,
I'll need a backer too.

00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:09.018
I've only told the boss's wife.

00:29:13.147 --> 00:29:15.441
So how much does my mom know?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.861
I didn't dare say that you use it.

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:21.614
I only said that you've been getting goods
from me for your friends.

00:29:26.119 --> 00:29:26.995
And then?

00:29:27.078 --> 00:29:28.454
She was very angry.

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:31.040
She told me to hurry and find a fall guy

00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:33.126
and not to tell the boss.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:35.086
She's afraid he'll beat you to death.

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:40.466
So I'm telling you, don't worry.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.385
I will handle these things.

00:29:44.012 --> 00:29:46.264
But you have to behave better too.

00:29:46.347 --> 00:29:49.309
The boss is preparing for the election.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:50.935
If you get into any trouble,

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:53.271
hey, you're lucky,

00:29:53.354 --> 00:29:55.231
you'll be half dead at most.

00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:56.274
I'm not so lucky.

00:29:56.357 --> 00:29:58.026
I'll be gone for good.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:05.575
You don't have a scapegoat yet, do you?

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:08.036
I know someone.

00:30:08.536 --> 00:30:09.412
I'll hook you up.

00:30:15.585 --> 00:30:17.837
Have you gotten used to life in Taipei?

00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:18.755
It's okay.

00:30:20.882 --> 00:30:23.384
Did your grandma come looking for you?

00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:25.929
Yeah.

00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:28.973
But my mom didn't let me see her.

00:30:30.892 --> 00:30:32.685
I did hear them arguing.

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:35.772
My mom said she'd hire a lawyer
and take my grandma to court.

00:30:44.948 --> 00:30:46.699
SHE SAID SHE'D SUE GRANDMA FOR ABUSE

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:54.624
She said my grandma didn't treat me well.

00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:56.626
My mom knows she's all about reputation.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.087
No way would she want this to escalate.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.257
Sure enough, my grandma compromised
and said she'd let me stay with my mom

00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:05.635
until I grow up and decide my future.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.223
That's great.

00:31:13.184 --> 00:31:15.520
By the way, let me tell you something.

00:31:15.603 --> 00:31:17.563
My mom wanted me to have a fresh start,

00:31:17.647 --> 00:31:19.482
so she gave me a new name.

00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:20.984
I'm taking her maiden name.

00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:22.068
My name is Shen Mu.

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:27.115
Can I still call you Yun-chen?

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:32.078
Sure.

00:31:32.704 --> 00:31:33.913
Only you can do that.

00:31:40.294 --> 00:31:42.797
I want to tell you something.

00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:45.341
What is it?

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:07.947
I think…

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.993
I like Li Jen-yao.

00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:24.297
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT LIKE HIM?

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.396
I already knew. It's super obvious.

00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:44.859
Really? Is it that obvious?

00:32:45.443 --> 00:32:47.945
Would Li Jen-yao have noticed too?

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:52.200
So are you going to confess your feelings
to him?

00:32:54.494 --> 00:32:57.163
I'm not sure if he likes me or not.

00:32:57.246 --> 00:33:00.833
Why would I confess my feelings?
It'll be so embarrassing if I'm rejected.

00:33:11.803 --> 00:33:13.930
Maybe he will be very happy.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.392
No matter what,
I hope you can be with someone you like.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:22.396
If he rejects you or breaks your heart,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.315
I'll return at once and smash his head in.

00:33:30.154 --> 00:33:32.490
You're the best. I love you the most.

00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:03.646
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.120
Jen-yao, are you awake?

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.295
You're awake.

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:29.672
I bought breakfast.

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:31.632
Hurry. Wash up and come eat.

00:34:43.644 --> 00:34:45.980
The shaobing shop
by the alleyway is open today.

00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:48.649
I also bought
a bowl of milkfish congee for you.

00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:57.491
How is it? How does it taste?

00:34:58.492 --> 00:34:59.535
It's all right.

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:05.875
Jen-yao, here.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:21.349
My coworker, Ms. Chang, told me

00:35:21.432 --> 00:35:25.561
that her son was also given a demerit
at school because of poor attendance.

00:35:25.645 --> 00:35:27.480
He almost got kicked out of school.

00:35:27.563 --> 00:35:31.067
Later, they talked to the school,
and he was allowed to continue.

00:35:32.485 --> 00:35:33.819
I think

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.073
your situation is pretty similar to his.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.618
Why don't I go to the school later
and talk to the teachers

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:43.621
to see if they can let you continue
until you graduate?

00:35:45.248 --> 00:35:46.749
Whatever happens,

00:35:47.458 --> 00:35:49.210
at least finish high school.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:50.753
Okay?

00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:53.673
I won't come back here.

00:35:55.007 --> 00:35:56.384
I won't go back to school either.

00:35:58.177 --> 00:35:59.804
I'm returning to Taipei tonight.

00:36:00.513 --> 00:36:02.473
Jen-yao.

00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:08.562
Let him be. If he wants to go, let him go.

00:36:18.698 --> 00:36:21.867
When was this place last aired out?
Why does it smell musty?

00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:24.370
-Dad.
-Yes?

00:36:24.453 --> 00:36:26.205
Aunt's place has been vacant for months.

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:27.873
Why doesn't she lease or sell it?

00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:31.836
Your aunt doesn't lack money.

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:33.045
Stop pressing.

00:36:33.129 --> 00:36:34.714
That fan isn't broken.

00:36:34.797 --> 00:36:38.342
Your aunt stopped the utility services
when the family left for Canada.

00:36:38.426 --> 00:36:40.761
This place would be haunted
if the fan started running.

00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:45.016
Hey, look.

00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:48.686
What do you think?
Don't I look like a Korean sweetheart?

00:36:50.396 --> 00:36:51.647
I really do think

00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:54.191
I look like Hyun Bin from this side.

00:36:55.192 --> 00:36:57.695
And from this side, I look like Won Bin.

00:36:57.778 --> 00:36:58.612
Don't I?

00:36:58.696 --> 00:37:00.531
-Not at all.
-You wish.

00:37:00.614 --> 00:37:01.741
Stop fooling around.

00:37:01.824 --> 00:37:03.492
How long do you want us cleaning?

00:37:03.576 --> 00:37:04.994
Hurry up.

00:37:05.077 --> 00:37:07.872
-How long do you want us cleaning?
-You stop fooling around.

00:37:07.955 --> 00:37:10.624
Hsiao-tung. Take those bags to the back.

00:37:11.584 --> 00:37:13.753
-Okay.
-Go.

00:37:13.836 --> 00:37:16.213
That towel is for cleaning glass,
not your hair.

00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:17.131
What?

00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:18.591
Hurry up and clean.

00:37:36.692 --> 00:37:37.693
Hello?

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:39.653
It's me.

00:37:40.154 --> 00:37:44.200
I… am returning to Taipei later today.
Just wanted to tell you that.

00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:48.245
You're going back to Taipei?
Why so sudden?

00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:49.163
Yeah.

00:37:51.082 --> 00:37:52.750
Have you bought a bus ticket yet?

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:54.335
What time is your bus leaving?

00:37:55.544 --> 00:37:57.046
I haven't bought a ticket yet.

00:37:57.671 --> 00:37:58.506
Why?

00:38:00.007 --> 00:38:03.177
If you haven't bought a ticket yet
and aren't in a hurry to leave,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.762
why don't I meet you in a bit?

00:38:05.471 --> 00:38:09.016
I'm thinking we can grab a bite
or something before you leave.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.144
Sure.

00:38:12.978 --> 00:38:14.105
What do you wanna eat?

00:38:14.772 --> 00:38:17.900
Why don't we go to a night market?
I'll decide then.

00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:19.819
Okay.

00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:22.446
Then let's meet at seven o'clock.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.615
I'll see you
where you dropped me off last time.

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:26.992
See you later.

00:38:27.493 --> 00:38:28.327
See you later.

00:38:47.513 --> 00:38:48.681
Go.

00:38:51.308 --> 00:38:53.310
You seemed to be in good spirits just now.

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:54.895
Where are you heading for fun?

00:38:56.063 --> 00:38:57.690
Just to play some cards.

00:38:59.525 --> 00:39:00.443
Big K,

00:39:01.402 --> 00:39:02.903
we can discuss this.

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:04.572
Didn't I already pay you back?

00:39:05.281 --> 00:39:08.367
Yes, you already paid me back.

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:11.036
But I heard
you cheated on a bet in Taipei.

00:39:11.537 --> 00:39:13.539
Hey, I heard you made a lot of money.

00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:17.710
Now those people from Taipei
have come looking here.

00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:19.003
I was thinking

00:39:19.628 --> 00:39:21.464
we've known each other for so long, right?

00:39:23.466 --> 00:39:25.301
We're so close.

00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:28.554
If anyone gets to pick on you, it's me.
How can I let others do it?

00:39:28.637 --> 00:39:29.597
So

00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:33.434
I took over your debt.

00:39:40.357 --> 00:39:42.151
You owe us money now.

00:39:43.444 --> 00:39:44.737
How are you gonna pay it?

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.835
Jen-yao, you're back. I made dinner.
Let's eat together in a bit.

00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:01.795
No need. I only came back for my luggage.

00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:03.339
I'm going back to Taipei in a bit.

00:40:03.422 --> 00:40:05.925
I'll visit you in Taipei later.

00:40:08.093 --> 00:40:09.929
Is anyone home? This is the police.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.389
Yes.

00:40:13.974 --> 00:40:15.059
Here, come in.

00:40:15.142 --> 00:40:16.894
-Here, this is my badge.
-Okay.

00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:18.646
Does Li Jen-yao live here?

00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:20.564
This is Li Jen-yao.

00:40:20.648 --> 00:40:22.274
So you're Li Jen-yao.

00:40:22.358 --> 00:40:25.027
Well, someone reported

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.989
that Jen-yao might be involved in
drug use and drug trafficking.

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.868
How can that be?
My son wouldn't do that sort of thing.

00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:35.287
It's all right.
We're just here to take a look.

00:40:35.371 --> 00:40:37.665
-Mind if we look inside the rooms?
-Sure, go ahead.

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:47.633
Did you make a mistake?

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:49.718
My son wouldn't do that sort of thing.

00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:52.137
Why don't you investigate a little more?

00:40:52.221 --> 00:40:53.681
I know my son.

00:40:53.764 --> 00:40:56.267
Impossible. He would never do
that sort of thing.

00:40:57.601 --> 00:40:58.435
I found something.

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:02.231
This isn't mine.

00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:05.442
No wonder I kept smelling burned plastic.

00:41:05.526 --> 00:41:08.279
It was you doing drugs in there
and selling them to others!

00:41:08.362 --> 00:41:10.364
-You piece of trash!
-I didn't.

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:11.448
Okay, let's go.

00:41:12.533 --> 00:41:14.577
-We'll talk at the station.
-It wasn't me.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.828
If not you, then who?

00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:18.080
You've gone rogue in Taipei.
Now you're doing this.

00:41:18.163 --> 00:41:20.291
-Li Jen-yao, I'll beat you!
-Come with me.

00:41:20.374 --> 00:41:21.959
-We'll talk at the station.
-Stop.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.004
Hey, don't run!

00:41:31.135 --> 00:41:33.095
-Don't run!
-Don't run! Stop!

00:41:35.556 --> 00:41:36.473
Stop!

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:40.686
-Stop!
-Don't run!

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:49.069
Check there.

00:41:56.994 --> 00:41:57.828
Go.

00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:19.808
Hey, Jen-yao.

00:42:19.892 --> 00:42:23.228
It's me, Ouyang Ti.
I heard you're hiding from the police.

00:42:24.146 --> 00:42:25.564
You set me up.

00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:26.732
So you're not dumb.

00:42:26.815 --> 00:42:29.818
Hey, selling drugs is a felony.

00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:33.572
Even if you're a minor,
you'll still do a few years if caught.

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:36.075
But your dad didn't hesitate at all.

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:37.993
For 500,000 NTD.

00:42:38.577 --> 00:42:39.995
For only 500,000 NTD,

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:42.164
your dad sold your future.

00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:46.919
Jen-yao, why is your life worth so little?

00:42:47.544 --> 00:42:49.171
It's so sad.

00:42:49.755 --> 00:42:51.131
I really pity you.

00:42:53.384 --> 00:42:54.968
Why are you doing this?

00:42:55.052 --> 00:42:56.428
I don't like you.

00:42:56.512 --> 00:42:58.931
Beating you up didn't satisfy me much.

00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:00.391
Look at me now.

00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:04.144
I'm having your dreams,

00:43:04.645 --> 00:43:07.272
your future, and everything you care about

00:43:07.773 --> 00:43:09.608
trampled underfoot

00:43:09.692 --> 00:43:11.819
and watching you slowly become desperate

00:43:12.945 --> 00:43:13.821
and miserable.

00:43:13.904 --> 00:43:16.365
And nobody is willing to believe you.

00:43:17.199 --> 00:43:18.784
Nobody is willing to help you.

00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:21.620
Isn't this more satisfying?

00:43:21.704 --> 00:43:24.623
I really want to see
the look on your face right now.

00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:28.669
Well, Jen-yao,
how about I come see you now?

00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:30.629
Jen-yao? Hello?

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.172
Hello?

00:43:32.256 --> 00:43:33.674
Hey, by the way,

00:43:33.757 --> 00:43:35.968
don't ever tell the police
that you didn't do it

00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:39.805
because I have a video
and photo of you getting high last time.

00:43:40.472 --> 00:43:44.268
After you're done playing hide and seek,
I'll send those to them.

00:43:45.227 --> 00:43:46.437
Smile.

00:44:45.204 --> 00:44:47.664
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:44:47.748 --> 00:44:50.083
Charges will apply after the beep.
Hang up if…

00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:57.549
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.
Charges will apply…

00:45:01.512 --> 00:45:03.305
Why isn't he answering the phone?

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.333
My dad sold me out.

00:45:33.377 --> 00:45:34.711
My mom doesn't believe me.

00:45:36.463 --> 00:45:37.965
They said I used and sold drugs.

00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:40.717
But I didn't.

00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:46.890
No one in this world believes me anymore.

00:45:48.517 --> 00:45:50.185
I don't know where I can go.

00:54:26.868 --> 00:54:31.873
