Before you are fully prepared,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.310
don't make decisions too soon.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.000
I will expose his true colors

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.560
before he deceives you.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.960
What's wrong?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.830
Do you really like me?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.950
I think I have already

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.950
made it quite obvious.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.240
I just don't know your attitude.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.400
Then...

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.190
Why not come to my place tomorrow night?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.720
I have a special gift

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720
for you.

(Wuyang Public Security)

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.270
You came so early.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.630
Don't you usually arrive right on time?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.430
I got up early today.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.680
Do you think this face

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.880
is good-looking?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.560
Is it very eye-catching

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.670
in a crowd?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.950
Xu,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.770
you came so early.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.910
You must've gotten up early.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.310
Yesterday was your son's birthday.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.160
You didn't go back?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.720
Special treatment for a special day.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.260
You asked me to look
into Zhang Yutong.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.270
Guess what.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.750
Chen Danling, Wang Chen,
and Zhang Yutong

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.270
were from the same high school.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.890
- They were close.
- Morning, Mr. Xu.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.800
Morning, Mr. Xu.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.270
- For some reason,
- Morning, Mr. Xu.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.750
Zhang Yutong and Chen Danling

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.790
stopped keeping in touch.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.480
However, Wang Chen and Zhang Yutong

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.710
have always stayed in contact.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.300
You and Liu Ming go check
the text message records.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.480
Also, check if Zhang Yutong

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.610
had time to commit the crime.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.450
Okay.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.750
You startled me.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.520
If I'm right,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.430
the torn half of the photo

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.270
is Zhang Yutong.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.800
Wang Chen tore her out of the photo

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.830
(Don't worry. I'm out.)
but kept in touch with her.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.500
(I'm fine.)

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.630
Chen Danling and Zhang Yutong

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.390
have both dated Zheng Xintao.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.870
There may be significant conflicts.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.310
Wang Chen should be

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.040
the mediator.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.310
If Wang Chen really is a scapegoat,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.510
she could be doing it for Chen Danling

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.120
or for Zhang Yutong.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.820
- Hi, Ms. Zhang.
- Is Ms. Wang here?

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.270
Ms. Wang didn't come today.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.370
She was taken away by the police.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.140
(Don't worry.)

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.460
(Don't worry.)

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.720
Ms. Zhang?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.240
(Moyun Press)
After being questioned,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.720
Zhang Yutong went to see Wang Chen.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.470
Is she trying
to coordinate their stories?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480
I'm starting to feel

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.630
that Zhang Yutong is strange.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.740
Let's have some coffee.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.560
Mr. Xu,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.400
what's wrong?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.670
Nothing.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.540
(Call from Zhang Yutong)

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
You know Wang Chen has been arrested.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.480
Do you feel any guilt?

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.360
You're just jealous of me.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.960
You're A monster

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.900
who doesn't know love.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.630
You're willing
to let Wang Chen die for your love.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.390
What right do you have to blame me?

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.420
Then let's make a bet.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.200
Tomorrow, will I be able

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.360
to keep my love?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.080
Let's wait and see.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.390
You

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.150
just don't like to smile.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.390
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.440
If you smile,

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.440
lots of girls will like you.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.480
I'm not you.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.670
Besides, this

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.150
isn't called love.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.780
Have you told that person

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.370
- about your thoughts?

Looking at your master

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.580
on television,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.150
do you feel a sense of pride?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.700

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.960
Where's the stuff?

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.630
This is the same bracelet

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.210
that Zheng Xintao gave to Zhang Yutong.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.910
Aren't you afraid

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.160
that Zhang Yutong will kill you?

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.790
When she's nervous,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.150
she uncontrollably bites her nails.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.270
Obviously, she's anxious.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.150
Anxiety is common for corporate slaves.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.150
Biting nails can be considered

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.120
a manifestation of anxiety.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.870
Why is she hiding?

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.910
Without direct evidence,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.480
it could be explained as a coincidence.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.990
Go find out

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.220
the address of Zhang Yutong's parents.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.260
(Call Records)

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.550
Zheng Xintao and Zhang Yutong

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:43.670
didn't have many calls.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.240
Before he died,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.480
there were no call records

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.390
between them.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.440
To get in touch,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.720
phones are not necessary.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.790
What about the relationship

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.380
among her, Wang Chen,
and Chen Danling?

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.240
They went to the same high school.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.590
The specifics are

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.180
(Basic Information)
under investigation.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.070
By the way,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.320
they used to be neighbors.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.710
We are checking all the surveillance
near the publishing house

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.870
and Zheng Xintao's residence

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.800
to see if Zhang Yutong has recently

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.640
gone to look for him.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840
We found a lot.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960
Why are we targeting her?

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.200
Shouldn't we

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.510
investigate Chen Danling?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.620
Are we not going to follow up
on Wang Chen?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.320
He has hurt so many girls,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.960
especially Chen Danling.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.490
Continue with Zhang Yutong.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.920
Yes.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.870
We still don't know

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.710
her current address.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.350
We submitted an inquiry request

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.360
to the car rental

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.640
and the food delivery companies.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.320
The info she registered outside

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.560
is her parents' home address.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.630
Xu has gone over.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.320
Have some fruit.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.870
Thanks.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.270
Keeping a large dog in the city

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.570
is inconvenient, right?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.720
We didn't keep it here.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.150
But it died a few years ago.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.600
Yutong was sad for a long time.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.080
They're Yutong's good friend.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.360
Are they still good friends now?

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.360
These years,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.600
thanks to their care for Yutong,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.630
she can be as healthy

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.510
as she is now.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.240
Why are you here again?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.510
About Yutong,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.030
we've explained it clearly.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.160
We have nothing to do
with the murder case.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.040
Mr. Zhang, right?

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.030
Was this painting by Zhang Yutong?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.960
It was given by her boyfriend.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.990
What boyfriend?

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.550
Today is Zhang Yutong's birthday.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.200
Didn't she celebrate with you?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.210
- Her boyfriend...
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.150
He's just harassing

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.120
Yutong.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.750
Let me say it again.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.080
We have nothing to do

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.440
with Zheng Xintao.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.110
(Psychiatry Department)
Please calm down.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.960
We just want to know

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.000
where Zhang Yutong

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.070
has been staying recently.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.420

was Zhang Yutong, right?

By doing this,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.870
are you trying to protect her

will completely ruin her.

Chen Danling was jealous
of Zhang Yutong

hurry up.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.400
I was too afraid,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400
so I left Yutong behind
