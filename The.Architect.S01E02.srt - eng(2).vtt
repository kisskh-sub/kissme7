=Episode 2=
(Shen Changning died from poisoning?)

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.479
Your Lordship.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.159
These two are too stubborn,

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:56.399
and won't say a thing.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.039
Pei Yu.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.039
You slaughter the innocent

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.560
and harm the loyal!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.640
You destroyed the Shen family.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.560
You will face retribution
sooner or later

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.879
and never to rise again!

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:11.840
Usually,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.079
you coroners use these things

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.200
to make the dead speak.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.280
Today I will use them on you.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:19.480
Will what I get

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.879
be true

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.599
or false?

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:23.640
Pei Yu.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.439
You are nothing but a dog.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.840
Your sister

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.400
learned to serve others

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.400
on a man's bed.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.959
Don't worry.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.640
I won't let you die easily.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.519
I will

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.560
slice you apart piece by piece.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.879
I'll confess.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.439
I'll tell you everything!

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.690
Your Lordship.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.519
The coroner has confirmed that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.400
the eldest daughter of the Shen family
was poisoned first, then drowned.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.360
Clearly someone did it deliberately.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.240
But Your Lordship,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.960
why are you so affected
by Shen Changning's death?

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.159
(Pei Yu's sister, Pei Shu)
Help me lift him up.

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:34.100
(Young Pei Yu)

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.400
(Young Shen Changning)
(Seeing her was when I first believed)

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.400
(that a person's eyes could truly)

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360
(shine as bright as the stars.)

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.400
Please accept this half jade pendant

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.479
for saving my life.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.960
I will repay this debt one day.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.000
I'll take it then.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.400
You owe me nothing now.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.159
Just focus on recovering.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.680
Don't think too much.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.400
May I ask your name, Miss?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.800
If fate wills it, we'll meet again.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.719
(Later, I searched for years,)

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.400
(only to learn she was
the Shen family's eldest daughter.)

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.199
(I never thought
that when we met again,)

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.900
(we would be separated
by life and death.)

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.319
(I must find her true murderer.)

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.680
What's more, fate played its tricks.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.520
The Shen family fell to ruin

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.879
in my hands.

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:00.900
(Pei Yu's confidant, Qin Feng)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.199
This poison is one of the foreign realm's
rare toxins.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.960
It is pollen,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.759
and also poison.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.120
Ten days ago,

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.199
it appeared at the Xichun House.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.879
Xichun House.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.919
Xi Yan.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.279
I thought Xiao Huaijin sent Xi Yan

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.079
into the residence to plant a spy.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.040
But now it seems

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.759
like is not that simple.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.279
I believe

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.360
Xi Yan has always kept quiet
in the backyard,

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.360
but now she has caused such chaos.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.959
She must have a bigger purpose.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.200
Why not eliminate her completely,
Your Lordship?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.399
(Shen Changning's death)

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.800
(is undoubtedly connected to her.)

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.279
(Pei Yu's martial skills
are exceptional.)

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.120
(Only with a single sure strike)

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.040
(can I take his life.)

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.319
(Otherwise, I will only doom myself.)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.279
(Just as Xiao Huaijin)

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.040
(ordered me to cooperate internally.)

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.800
(Using talismans to frame Pei Yu
for plotting against the Emperor.)

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.879
(I might as well go along with it.)

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.560
(First, borrow Pei Yu's hand)

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.120
(to deal with my other enemies.)

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.759
(When they kill each other,)

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.639
(I can)

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.839
(reap the profits as the fisherman.)

If you remove all your adornments,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.079
I would like it even more.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.399
I

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.720
have ways to make you
like it even more, Your Lordship.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:00.720
You misunderstand.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.040
What I mean is,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.240
I want you to confess honestly

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.399
for what purpose did you infiltrate
the Governor's Residence?

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.319
Naturally, I hoped
to receive your favor.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.279
Unwilling to tell the truth?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.399
Then drink this cup of liquor.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.439
(Xiao Huaijin once gave me
poisoned liquor.)

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.990
Your Lordship, please calm your anger.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.260
The matter of Shen Changning
being poisoned to death

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.300
has nothing to do with me.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.279
A confession without pressure.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.759
When did I ever say

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920
that Shen Changning died from poisoning?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.279
Report, Your Lordship.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.660
The Young Lord Xiao
has brought soldiers.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.130
He has already entered the residence.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.425
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

00:08:14.587 --> 00:08:21.187
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:24.720
I wonder under whose orders

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.199
Young Lord Xiao dares
to break into my residence.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:28.279
Governor Pei,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.839
I do not wish to do this either.

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:33.025
But His Majesty's birthday is near,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.240
yet rumors say

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.679
that within your residence,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600
there are items disrespectful
to His Majesty.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:41.519
Thus His Majesty ordered me

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:44.039
to come and clear your name.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.080
Search thoroughly!

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.240
Today,

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.000
we must give His Majesty an explanation.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.639
Yes.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.480
Governor Pei,

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:11.519
they say the birthday star lives
a long life,

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.559
ascending to immortality.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.950
How could you use talisman paper
to suppress evil?

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.000
Are you not afraid

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.840
that ill-intentioned people
will spread rumors,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.600
claiming you cursed
His Majesty's ascension?

00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:25.650
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.399
Yellow background and red lines

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.600
can be used for cursing and suppression,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.840
or for blessings and auspice.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.559
How does Young Lord Xiao know

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.559
that the yellow-red lines
on the birthday talisman

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.720
were not meant as blessings
for His Majesty?

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.720
(Xiao Huaijin.)

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.080
(You poisoned me.)

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.759
(I will personally put you to death.)

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.720
The Governor sought out Taoist masters
across the land,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.759
and finally invited
the Grand Master of Heaven's Way

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:39.480
to draw talismans and
pray for His Majesty.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.200
The cinnabar used in the talisman

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.279
was refined with the Governor's
own fingertip blood

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.759
to complete the ritual.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.480
Whether it's curse or blessing,

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:52.080
should be judged by
the Astronomical Bureau.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:55.240
Governor Pei,

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:57.279
please come with me.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.080
Your Majesty,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.679
I have verified without error.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:08.039
The secret text written
on the talisman paper

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.240
is an ancient script,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.000
all of which are words of blessing.

00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:12.212
(The Emperor of Great Liang)

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.919
Lord Lu,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.799
you must look carefully.

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:19.960
Arts of cursing

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.120
can mislead the people.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.720
This concerns not only

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.320
Governor Pei's future,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960
but also the honor of the royal family.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.399
Young Lord Xiao, are you suggesting

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.679
that I colluded
with the Astronomical Bureau

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.360
to harm His Majesty?

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:35.039
It is Governor Pei's actions

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.879
that inevitably raise suspicion.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.440
Qilin Guards obey His Majesty's
command, guarding the capital,

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.759
watching over the realm.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.440
As for these curse arts

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.240
and charlatans pretending
to wield mystic powers,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.279
the Qilin Guards have executed
countless of them.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.120
Governor Pei...

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.799
- Enough.
- Your…

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:53.440
Mr. Xiao,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.120
I sent a verbal decree for you

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.480
to clarify matters,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.919
not to let others misunderstand Mr. Pei.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.320
Mr. Pei has rendered service
to the nation.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.960
I

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.519
have never doubted him.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:06.799
Your Majesty is wise.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.000
I

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.720
was merely worried for Your Majesty

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.240
and lost my composure for a moment.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.240
I beg Your Majesty's punishment.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.120
Mr. Pei.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:17.279
Mr. Xiao spoke rashly.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.639
In your opinion,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.320
how should he be punished?

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.600
Though the Young Lord Xiao acted rashly,

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:27.690
his loyalty to the court
is unquestioned.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:30.639
In my view,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.200
half a month of seclusion for reflection

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.600
will allow him to understand

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:36.879
how he should serve
the court henceforth.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.679
Very well.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.080
Mr. Xiao,

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:44.960
thank Mr. Pei at once.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.200
Thank you, Mr. Pei,

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:54.960
for showing mercy.

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:06.250
(The Governor's Residence)

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.480
Wretch!

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.639
Well?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.800
Nothing serious happened, right?

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:20.919
Wretch.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:21.960
Best beat her to death.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.879
A filthy brat from the brothel,
daring to use such vile tricks

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.639
to seduce the Governor in his residence.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:28.960
Today, on the Madame's behalf,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.080
I'll teach you proper rules!

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.679
We are both women,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.559
why tear each other apart
and serve as tools for others?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.200
Who is as shameless as you?

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.120
Your Lordship.

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:02.159
All of you, listen carefully.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:04.000
I, Xi Yan, have a bad temper

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.790
and a ruthless hand.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.500
If you wish to provoke me,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.120
measure your own worth first.

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:27.799
Someone capable of drawing Daoist seals

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.960
reduced to a dancer
in the Governor's Residence?

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:32.960
Your Lordship, do not laugh.

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:35.480
I'm cleaning up your mess.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:37.320
Your beauty

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:39.399
is far more vicious than I expected.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.840
(Her words and actions)

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:51.240
(are completely unlike the woman)

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.679
(I once saw in Xichun House.)

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.360
(Who is she, truly?)

00:14:57.875 --> 00:14:59.875
(End of Episode)

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.679
(I never imagined there could
be eyes so alike in this world.)

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.490
