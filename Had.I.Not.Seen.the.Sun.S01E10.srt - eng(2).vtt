00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:31.112
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:33.072
EMERGENCY ROOM

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:34.157
Go easy.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.327
Excuse me. Earlier, a--

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.411
Mrs. Chiang.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.214
He's in the ward on the fourth floor.
I'll take you.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.814
You told me to talk
to Hsiao-tung's teacher alone,

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:09.359
and you went to hit them with the truck!

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:10.610
What's wrong with you?

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:12.111
Are you crazy?

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:15.490
You think you wouldn't go to jail
if you killed them?

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:28.127
If you went to jail,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:30.672
what would I do?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.508
What would I do?

00:02:58.408 --> 00:03:00.493
Hi, are you Mrs. Chiang?

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.167
Mrs. Chiang is here.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.135
Mrs. Chiang.

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:21.055
We already know what Mr. Chiang did.

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.100
The parents were going to sue him.

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:27.270
But I'm a Buddhist.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.813
I believe

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:31.482
vengeance breeds vengeance,
which leads nowhere.

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.067
That's why…

00:03:35.528 --> 00:03:37.780
I'd like to offer you some options.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:40.158
This incident

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:43.703
could be attempted murder,
a serious crime,

00:03:44.704 --> 00:03:47.123
or a random accident.

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:50.335
Mrs. Chiang.

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:52.253
What do you think?

00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:55.048
Are you telling us not to sue your son?

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:03.765
Mrs. Chiang.

00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:05.892
We're both moms.

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.478
I know how miserable you must feel now.

00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:12.231
Your daughter was treated so unfairly.

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:15.485
It's only natural
that you want to pursue justice.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:17.278
But has it ever occurred to you

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.864
that if you really were to sue…

00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.534
Our kids are all minors

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:24.911
and first-time offenders.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:29.040
Even if they get sent to jail,
it wouldn't be for long.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:31.751
With some connections,

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.420
they'd be out in no time.

00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:37.131
Then I could send my son abroad,

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.050
and he could start over any time.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:40.551
But what about

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:42.470
your daughter?

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:45.723
Could she start over too?

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.851
Your husband's a councillor,
so you're above the law?

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:51.562
Mrs. Chiang.

00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:57.402
From now on, every time you're in court,
you'll feel this pain and helplessness.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:02.907
Negotiating with the parents at school
was hard enough, wasn't it?

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:05.827
What about your daughter, then?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.914
Is she ready to face
that kind of harsh reality?

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.166
Once this goes to court,

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.795
your daughter will suffer the most.

00:05:17.463 --> 00:05:20.633
Gosh, she'll have to live with how people
perceive her for the rest of her life

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:25.930
and relive what happened that day in court
over and over again.

00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:30.643
How many times will it take
before she has a mental breakdown?

00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:35.690
Not to mention that her dad may go to jail
for trying to get revenge for her.

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:38.443
Mrs. Chiang,

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:41.571
is this really worth it?

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.414
If she were my daughter,

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:55.543
I couldn't bear to let her
go to court and suffer like that.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.297
I'd seek compensation instead.

00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:03.384
I'd find a way
to give her better resources

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.636
to live a better life

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.056
and rebuild her future.

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:15.480
If I were you…

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.069
I wouldn't settle
for that small amount of money.

00:06:23.613 --> 00:06:27.783
I'd ask for… a lot more.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.381
Hey, handsome.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:44.008
You're back?

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:49.931
Come on, I'll do it. Be careful.

00:06:50.556 --> 00:06:51.807
Here, sit down.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.853
I'm relieved to see you like this.

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:59.524
I thought I had beaten you so badly
that I might've crippled you.

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:02.235
That would've been a shame
because you're so handsome, right?

00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:05.696
Listen.

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.574
I've… been there.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.078
No one here dares
to go against the Ouyangs.

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:15.248
I think that girl's parents

00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:19.043
will definitely… settle the case.

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:21.045
That's impossible.

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:24.048
They won't let him get away with it.

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:26.676
Let's wait and see.

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.347
Listen to me.

00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:34.392
Take care of yourself first.

00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:37.728
Currently, our boss is busy
with the election.

00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:39.438
He has no time to deal with you.

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:42.108
After the election, it's hard to say.

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:43.734
If I were you,

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:45.820
I'd pack up and leave.

00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:47.613
You know what I mean?

00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:55.204
Milkfish soup.

00:07:55.288 --> 00:07:56.914
I couldn't get any sea bass.

00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:58.791
Come on.

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:00.876
Drink some. Refuel your body. Got it?

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:15.266
OUYANG HSIANG FOR LEGISLATIVE YUAN

00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.776
OUYANG HSIANG FOR LEGISLATIVE YUAN

00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:02.104
Your dad hit those people
with a truck today.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:07.610
He's slightly injured, but he'll live.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.487
He has to remain in the hospital.

00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:14.200
Those people are lucky too.
They all dodged him.

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:15.993
They only suffered scratches and sprains.

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:21.082
But they now have a hold on your dad.

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:22.458
So

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.835
they can choose

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:27.213
to sue him for attempted murder.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.468
Another option

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.969
is to settle.

00:09:35.096 --> 00:09:37.264
They won't sue us, and we won't sue them.

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:41.435
I chose to settle.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.928
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG, CHUNG-NAN MIDDLE SCHOOL
FIRST IN SOLO, DISTRICT BALLET FINALS

00:10:18.597 --> 00:10:21.100
PARTY A WILL PAY PARTY B FIVE MILLION
PARTY B WILL NOT SUE PARTY A

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:22.768
I'll give this to them once you sign it.

00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:26.313
They'll give me the settlement agreement
for the truck accident.

00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:34.363
Why does it say

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:36.699
we're going to take their money?

00:10:37.783 --> 00:10:39.243
Why not?

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:43.581
Their son owes you this.

00:10:43.664 --> 00:10:45.249
It's what you deserve.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:48.461
We must take it.

00:10:49.587 --> 00:10:51.714
You have to use this money
to live a better life.

00:10:51.797 --> 00:10:53.215
You can't just be bullied.

00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:15.404
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:32.171
PARTY A, NAME: OUYANG TI
PARTY B, NAME:

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:40.596
CHIANG HSIAO-TUNG

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:35.651
You told Hsiao-tung to sign it?

00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:46.620
Did you think I was dead?

00:12:48.497 --> 00:12:50.666
Aren't you ashamed of taking this money?

00:12:54.086 --> 00:12:56.088
Our daughter was raped and mistreated.

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:58.799
If we don't seek justice,
what kind of parents are we?

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.097
How can we seek justice?

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:09.643
We're just ordinary folks.
How can we fight them in court?

00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:13.397
If we lose the case,
what will Hsiao-tung do?

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:17.484
Even if we win, they'll only be imprisoned
for a few years, at most.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:23.324
Then their parents
can whitewash their troublesome past,

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:25.492
and they can start over.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:30.539
But what about Hsiao-tung?

00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:34.710
This will stay with her forever.

00:13:47.765 --> 00:13:49.808
I failed Hsiao-tung.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:53.020
I'm useless.

00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:58.025
She has a useless mom.

00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:02.404
There's no way to seek justice for her.

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:46.949
Hsiao-tung.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.660
Hsiao-tung, I'm home.

00:14:49.743 --> 00:14:51.787
I bought your favorite food…

00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:56.375
Hsiao-tung.

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:34.246
It's okay.

00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:37.082
I'm okay.

00:15:39.084 --> 00:15:40.919
As long as I can keep dancing,

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:43.714
everything will be okay.

00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.345
It's okay.

00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:52.765
I'm okay.

00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:56.226
As long as I can keep dancing,

00:15:57.936 --> 00:15:59.813
everything will be okay.

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:17.081
It's okay.

00:16:18.707 --> 00:16:19.958
I'm okay.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:24.004
As long as I can keep dancing,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.548
everything will be okay.

00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:40.938
It's okay.

00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:44.233
I'm okay.

00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:48.028
As long as I can keep dancing…

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.365
everything will be okay.

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:06.672
You dance so well.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.424
Look at me.

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:11.510
Come on, look at the camera.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.600
-Doesn't count.
-Yeah.

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:01.226
Last two shots. All right.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.352
-Enough.
-I'm tired.

00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:04.229
-Let's go home.
-What do you mean?

00:18:04.313 --> 00:18:05.480
No, I…

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:07.691
-Who does this?
-Come on, let's go.

00:18:07.774 --> 00:18:09.276
One more round? Do you want to…

00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:11.945
Che-li, let's play again
tomorrow after school.

00:18:12.696 --> 00:18:13.739
I'm exhausted.

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.450
You're all ignoring me.

00:18:18.118 --> 00:18:19.745
Let's not play with him. He sucks.

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:21.663
-He does. Don't play with him.
-Yep.

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.665
-Let's not play with him.
-I know.

00:18:47.814 --> 00:18:49.566
You've looked everywhere you could.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.235
Where else will you search now?

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:52.402
You gotta tell me.

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:53.612
Gosh, I don't know.

00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:55.739
We couldn't find Hsiao-tung all night.

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:56.990
How can I just sit at home?

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:58.909
Wait at home. I'll search the area again.

00:18:58.992 --> 00:19:00.035
No, don't go.

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:01.703
I'll search for her.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:03.538
How can you go like this?

00:19:58.677 --> 00:19:59.511
Hsiao-tung.

00:20:22.284 --> 00:20:24.494
Why are you looking at me that way?

00:20:25.245 --> 00:20:27.247
Like I'm about to jump.

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:30.751
I don't think that.

00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:36.631
Really?

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:41.303
But if I said…

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:45.640
that's what I wanted,

00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:47.851
what would you do?

00:20:57.069 --> 00:20:58.820
If that's what you want to do,

00:20:59.696 --> 00:21:01.031
that's okay too.

00:21:02.532 --> 00:21:03.408
I'll go with you.

00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:22.135
Remember, we said…

00:21:25.889 --> 00:21:27.182
whatever happens…

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.189
I won't leave you alone again.

00:22:31.455 --> 00:22:33.081
You don't have to say anything.

00:22:34.082 --> 00:22:35.375
I'm just glad you're back.

00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:44.759
Come on.

00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:53.477
What's wrong?

00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:56.855
Can I…

00:23:00.358 --> 00:23:02.027
can I give up?

00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:07.199
Can I just leave here

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:09.409
without worrying about anything?

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.071
EXQUISITE LODGING FOR RENT

00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:01.044
I WANT TO SEE YOU. CAN I?

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:27.487
Hey. Li Jen-yao.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:43.086
Tomorrow…

00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:47.841
we're moving to Taipei.

00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:54.472
After you move to Taipei,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.641
will you stay in touch?

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:00.812
Or

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.064
can I

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:06.192
call you when I'm free?

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:19.164
If possible,

00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:21.958
once I'm in Taipei this time…

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:25.879
I want to start over.

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:31.551
Trust me.

00:25:32.677 --> 00:25:35.805
The next time we meet,

00:25:37.682 --> 00:25:38.933
I'll definitely be better

00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:41.353
than I am now.

00:25:48.068 --> 00:25:49.653
Why are you so quiet?

00:25:51.154 --> 00:25:52.572
Do you not trust me very much?

00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:55.909
No.

00:25:58.745 --> 00:26:00.372
I was just wondering…

00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:04.000
when our next meeting

00:26:05.752 --> 00:26:07.087
will take place.

00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:15.095
Didn't we agree
to celebrate Christmas together?

00:26:17.514 --> 00:26:18.473
If

00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.810
we meet here on Christmas

00:26:22.769 --> 00:26:24.270
five years from now,

00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:25.897
would that be okay?

00:26:42.288 --> 00:26:43.164
That's okay.

00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:02.512
Since Taichung's former legislator,
Chin Chung-nan,

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:04.472
resigned over a drunk driving accident,

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:06.933
a special election
for Taichung District Two

00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:08.560
will be held this weekend.

00:29:08.643 --> 00:29:11.688
According to our latest poll,

00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:13.857
with 43% to 36% support,

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.609
Ouyang Hsiang holds a wide lead
over Cheng Chang-chiu.

00:29:16.693 --> 00:29:18.027
Although in this poll,

00:29:18.111 --> 00:29:21.573
close to 20% of voters remain undecided.

00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:25.702
Given how powerful Councillor Ouyang
has grown in the area over the years,

00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:27.745
the election outcome seems fairly certain.

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:30.790
But it's still worth monitoring
for new developments

00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:32.041
until the very end.

00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:34.544
Stay tuned for ongoing coverage.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.512
TO COUNCILLOR CHENG CHANG-CHIU

00:30:06.492 --> 00:30:08.036
It's true, and let me tell you…

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:09.162
Let me tell you.

00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:12.206
Ballet girls can spread
their legs super wide.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.043
-How high can their legs go?
-The one before, right?

00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:18.129
-She's beautiful.
-Don't say that. She's the one on stage.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.174
In the future?

00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:23.092
I don't know either.

00:30:23.676 --> 00:30:25.803
But I've been doing ballet every day

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:28.056
since I was five.

00:30:28.139 --> 00:30:29.849
Dancing feels like a part of me now.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.478
If I don't dance,
I don't know what else I can do.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:35.813
Hey, Li Jen-yao!

00:31:31.244 --> 00:31:33.830
No, I didn't.
I think the last one on stage is cute.

00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:35.540
Hey, the one on the left is hot.

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:36.582
-Yeah.
-The right one.

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:40.211
Why didn't anyone tell me En-ya's class
would perform in underwear and stockings?

00:31:40.294 --> 00:31:41.963
I was hard the whole time.

00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:43.464
Fuck, you're still hard now?

00:31:43.548 --> 00:31:44.424
Fuck, are you dumb?

00:31:44.507 --> 00:31:47.093
Those are ballet clothes,
not underwear and stockings.

00:31:47.176 --> 00:31:50.346
-They're like bikinis, okay? It's…
-You horndog.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.597
-You're still hard?
-Yeah.

00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:52.765
-You're hard?
-Show me.

00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:53.683
-No.
-Let me see.

00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:54.851
You must put ice on it.

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:55.935
The instructor might see.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:58.604
He might castrate you,
I'm telling you. Damn.

00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:00.815
Jen-yao, why are you here?

00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:24.797
Fuck!

00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:26.466
-What the heck?
-Ouyang!

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:28.718
Don't… don't drag me into this.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.261
-Let's go.
-Stay away from me!

00:32:30.344 --> 00:32:31.888
Fuck, you jerk. Here you go again.

00:32:32.972 --> 00:32:34.182
Let's go!

00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:43.900
Help me.

00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:47.737
Help…

00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:19.268
Don't.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.911
Don't.

00:33:43.334 --> 00:33:44.335
Jen-yao.

00:33:44.836 --> 00:33:46.337
I'm home.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.257
I bought you drumsticks with rice.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.050
Come and eat.

00:34:13.364 --> 00:34:17.118
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF
JEN-YAO

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.581
Breaking news.

00:34:21.664 --> 00:34:23.249
A stabbing occurred on a campus

00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:25.626
in the central region this afternoon.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.296
Reports say the injured boy's father
is Ouyang Hsiang,

00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:31.299
who is running in the Taichung
Legislative Yuan special election.

00:34:31.382 --> 00:34:34.802
Ouyang Hsiang is currently on his way
to the hospital with his wife.

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:37.805
His rival, Cheng Chang-chiu,
will hold a press conference later.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.515
He hinted to reporters

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:42.894
that he has evidence
against Ouyang Hsiang.

00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:44.020
For more details, we--

00:34:51.194 --> 00:34:53.738
JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER

00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:55.406
AUGUST 2007

00:35:13.299 --> 00:35:15.635
Have you gotten used to being in there?

00:35:21.724 --> 00:35:23.309
I heard…

00:35:25.853 --> 00:35:28.189
many people in there are picking on you.

00:35:58.052 --> 00:35:59.262
That secret message,

00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:02.431
you sent it
to Cheng Chang-chiu, didn't you?

00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:06.686
To stir things up

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:10.523
and get as much media coverage
on this drug case as possible,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.317
you even went to school

00:36:13.943 --> 00:36:16.946
and stabbed my son in front of a crowd.

00:36:18.572 --> 00:36:20.700
You just wanted to drag him into it

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.702
so he'd go to jail too, right?

00:36:23.703 --> 00:36:25.288
I don't know what you mean.

00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:29.875
I only know that Ouyang Ti framed me
for dealing drugs.

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:33.045
Stabbing him twice is only fair.

00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:34.839
Thanks to you,

00:36:36.424 --> 00:36:38.467
we lost the election

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:41.345
we were supposed to win.

00:36:43.264 --> 00:36:44.515
Let me ask you.

00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:46.684
Did you stab my son

00:36:47.435 --> 00:36:50.563
just because he framed you
for dealing drugs,

00:36:51.063 --> 00:36:52.231
and nothing else?

00:36:52.315 --> 00:36:53.816
Isn't that enough of a reason?

00:36:58.321 --> 00:36:59.613
Let me tell you.

00:36:59.697 --> 00:37:01.282
When I get out,

00:37:01.782 --> 00:37:03.034
I'll surely stab him again.

00:37:05.578 --> 00:37:07.538
Do you think that because you're a minor,

00:37:08.122 --> 00:37:11.334
whatever your sentence,

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.836
you will get out quickly?

00:37:15.504 --> 00:37:17.048
You're wrong.

00:37:20.885 --> 00:37:23.220
You messed with my son this time.

00:37:25.014 --> 00:37:26.307
I'll let you know

00:37:26.891 --> 00:37:30.561
that my son, Ouyang Ti,
isn't someone you can mess with.

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.126
Hey, want a smoke?

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.587
Can we? We're on duty now.

00:37:57.088 --> 00:37:58.381
It's okay.

00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:01.342
One cigarette only takes five minutes.

00:38:02.468 --> 00:38:04.220
Nothing major will happen. Come on.

00:38:09.433 --> 00:38:11.352
Madam wants me to say hello to you.

00:38:20.694 --> 00:38:22.488
What?

00:38:31.288 --> 00:38:32.123
Let me see.

00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.543
That's not enough.

00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:37.837
I told you, I'm not strong enough.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.921
You do it.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.224
I almost forgot.

00:38:50.307 --> 00:38:51.809
Madam specifically said

00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:54.395
beating you three times a day
is too easy on you.

00:38:54.478 --> 00:38:56.814
She wants us to find
other ways to entertain you.

00:38:56.897 --> 00:38:57.857
Like this.

00:38:58.441 --> 00:39:01.277
So that you'll get more prison time
for causing trouble.

00:39:06.782 --> 00:39:09.827
Someone's beating us!

00:39:10.953 --> 00:39:11.871
Let go!

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.373
Someone's beating us!

00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:15.624
What are you doing?

00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:16.667
All of you, get down!

00:39:19.128 --> 00:39:20.588
You want to cause trouble?

00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:22.047
-It hurts!
-Get down!

00:39:26.677 --> 00:39:28.137
It hurts.

00:39:31.098 --> 00:39:31.932
Help me.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.895
Are you okay?

00:39:35.978 --> 00:39:38.105
Gosh, look at your wound.

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:54.413
Trust me.

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:57.708
The next time we meet,

00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.960
I'll definitely be better

00:40:00.711 --> 00:40:02.379
than I am now.

00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:46.507

THEY ALL CAME IN HER?
SHE'S DESTROYED

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.893
FUCK! I WENT TO YI-X SCHOOL

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:00.938
JERKED OFF
HOW MUCH TO BANG HER?

00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:02.231
HER FAMILY HAS A BBQ STALL

00:41:02.314 --> 00:41:03.399
I EVEN KNOW HER MOM

00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:07.194
SHE SEEMS UNWILLING, BUT I CAME ANYWAY

00:41:08.571 --> 00:41:09.738
SHE WAS CLEARLY RAPED

00:41:09.822 --> 00:41:11.490
CUT THE ACT, DON'T JERK OFF TO THIS

00:41:13.325 --> 00:41:14.827
YI-X SCHOOL YEAR 2, X HSIAO-TUNG

00:42:26.482 --> 00:42:28.901
LITTLE BITCH, X HSIAO-TUNG, FUCKING WHORE

00:42:43.916 --> 00:42:45.626
JANUARY 2014

00:43:08.357 --> 00:43:10.317
To cut all ties with your dad,

00:43:10.818 --> 00:43:14.279
I stopped contacting him
after the divorce.

00:43:15.823 --> 00:43:17.616
Believe me. I'm telling you the truth.

00:43:23.414 --> 00:43:25.833
Anyway, let's go home first.

00:43:25.916 --> 00:43:28.794
I cooked pig's trotter noodles.
Let's get rid of bad luck.

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:34.133
Mom.

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:35.884
You go home first.

00:43:36.552 --> 00:43:37.970
I want to go somewhere else.

00:44:25.976 --> 00:44:26.852
Hey.

00:44:27.436 --> 00:44:28.353
Hey.

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:39.031
When will our next meeting take place?

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.700
Didn't we agree

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:44.161
to celebrate Christmas together?

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.623
If

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:51.001
we meet here on Christmas…

00:44:54.254 --> 00:44:56.006
five years from now,

00:44:57.674 --> 00:44:58.717
would that be okay?

00:51:14.009 --> 00:51:16.803
ROAD WORK, DETOUR

00:51:16.887 --> 00:51:19.139
8 MONTHS LATER

00:51:28.398 --> 00:51:29.983
Li, are you done eating?

00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:32.068
We still have work to do.

00:52:35.465 --> 00:52:36.591
Chiang Hsiao-tung.

00:53:04.953 --> 00:53:05.870
I'm sorry.

00:53:07.747 --> 00:53:08.999
I thought you were someone else.

00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:12.085
Okay.

00:53:42.532 --> 00:53:43.491
Do you need help?

00:53:47.787 --> 00:53:49.122
It seems like

00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:51.875
you really need help.

00:53:53.084 --> 00:53:55.628
I'm on my way to host a radio show,

00:53:55.712 --> 00:53:57.756
but the cab driver brought me here.

00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.215
I don't know where this is.

00:53:59.716 --> 00:54:01.301
The show is about to start.

00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:04.179
I still can't find
the way to the radio station.

00:54:04.971 --> 00:54:07.057
Tell me the address you'd like to go to.

00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:08.808
I'll take you there.

00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:14.689
The GPS says it's right here.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:16.024
Okay.

00:54:17.942 --> 00:54:20.570
Is there an accessible route
next to the building?

00:54:21.696 --> 00:54:22.697
Yes.

00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:25.116
Just lead me there.

00:54:25.742 --> 00:54:26.576
Okay.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.630
There's still time before the show starts.
You can make it.

00:54:39.714 --> 00:54:40.548
Thank you.

00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:50.767
Excuse me.

00:54:52.102 --> 00:54:53.144
Can I

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.605
ask your name?

00:54:59.067 --> 00:55:01.319
Don't you host a radio show?

00:55:02.362 --> 00:55:03.738
I'd like to listen to it.

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:09.369
I'm Hsia Tien-ching.

00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:13.748
I host a show on Rising Radio
three days a week.

00:55:13.832 --> 00:55:16.209
You can give it a listen
if you have the time.

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:23.675
Sure.

00:55:27.053 --> 00:55:28.388
What about you?

00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:33.184
What's your name?

00:55:46.364 --> 00:55:47.657
My name is Li Jen-yao.

00:55:53.246 --> 00:55:54.080
Okay.

00:55:57.792 --> 00:55:59.627
Your show is about to start.

00:56:00.753 --> 00:56:02.422
Right, I'll get to work, then.

00:56:05.383 --> 00:56:06.259
Let me get it.

00:57:32.303 --> 00:57:34.681
Why didn't you spare the kid?
What did he do wrong?

00:57:36.683 --> 00:57:37.976
Maybe

00:57:39.769 --> 00:57:41.771
I'm just a jerk.

00:57:44.649 --> 00:57:48.319
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW NEEDS SUPPORT,
THERE IS HELP.

00:57:48.403 --> 00:57:49.737
