00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:41.105
Two streets away
is your sister's courtyard.

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:43.865
I know.

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:48.985
All these years,

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.025
your junior sister has acted
as a messenger.

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:57.025
Every now and then,
I could tell how she was doing.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.225
Don't sniff the tree, or it'll go bald.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:17.465
Bai Wan!

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:22.425
This is the second this year.

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:25.225
I need you to make another sudden trip.

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.345
So you've kept writing to him
all these years

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.585
just because you want to know
every year that he's safe?

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:35.745
Yes…

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:38.505
and no.

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:43.345
Seeing how he's all by himself,
he does seem a bit pitiful.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.465
I have been writing for so many years

00:02:46.545 --> 00:02:49.945
because I want him to know
someone out there is thinking of him.

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:53.705
Now you're on your own too,
living all alone in Chang'an,

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:55.345
and I care about you as well.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:59.825
You have to let me know
that you are safe every single day.

00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:03.025
I'm not made of porcelain.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:04.865
I'm not that easy to crack or bruise.

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:07.505
Better safe than sorry.

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:10.945
How about this?

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:13.505
If you ever run into danger,

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:16.905
you can let a paper kite fly.

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:19.865
I have plenty of eyes and ears
in the city.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.105
They will tell me right away.

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:42.785
I almost got him.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:44.865
I chased him to Yanzuo Ward,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.985
but Qingyi showed up and pulled him out.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:51.385
He slipped into Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:55.865
When the Huben Army was first established,

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.105
my father secretly
set up Hidden Soldier Alley.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.265
There are hidden bases in Chang'an.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:04.545
Inside them are enough food and weaponry.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:06.185
If they ever need to retreat,

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:09.865
there are craftsmen assigned
to make travel passes for the Huben Army.

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:11.985
Where is it? I can go in.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:13.545
No need to rush.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.184
He is inside. He won't come out just yet.

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:18.384
My goal is to wipe out

00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:20.705
the entire Huben Army
centered around Yan Fengshan.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.705
There is no intel confirming that
Yan Fengshan is in Hidden Soldier Alley,

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.385
so sending troops is pointless.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:28.545
It would only alert them.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:42.625
Stop.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:50.025
You may not know me,
but you should at least know him.

00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:51.385
OLD WOMAN
GATEKEEPER OF HIDDEN SOLDIER ALLEY

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:52.505
I know you two.

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:56.505
But the general set the rules.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.665
Anyone entering or leaving
Hidden Soldier Alley

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:02.625
has to leave gold behind.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:08.385
Hurry up.

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.305
Wait.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:20.265
I bought you some pinellia and poria.

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.785
Boil them and drink the decoction
every day. It helps your throat.

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:52.985
Go.

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:57.465
Ziyan, this way.

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:10.505
Ziyan.

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.745
Who on earth injured you so badly?

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:25.825
A man who was already supposed to be dead.

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:32.305
Pu Nichuan.

00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:36.505
But last night,

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.385
he was dead for good.

00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:45.945
Whoever is behind all this
is really something.

00:06:47.985 --> 00:06:50.905
Even a discarded pawn
of the Huben Army was put to use.

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:56.145
The one behind this
is someone you probably know too.

00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:07.545
My brother's son, Liu Zhi.

00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:08.985
He's all grown up.

00:07:17.385 --> 00:07:22.745
He probably came back
to avenge his father.

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:34.065
Ziyan.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:37.145
I don't come here very often.

00:07:37.225 --> 00:07:40.385
Stay here and take your medicine.
Rest and recover.

00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:42.545
Once I bring a physician back,

00:07:43.385 --> 00:07:45.305
you can stay here and focus on recovering.

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:48.905
Once your wounds mend,
you can go wherever you want.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:50.825
Leave on your own whenever you like.

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:55.625
You only need to show up
when General Fengshan summons you again.

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:01.065
Since when did you

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:04.465
start arranging my affairs?

00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:06.505
You're overthinking it, Ziyan.

00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:11.785
What I'm saying is,
just focus on getting better.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:14.705
As for the rest, leave it to me.

00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:22.065
That brat ran off
with the deposed emperor.

00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:25.625
General Fengshan sent word.

00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:29.185
He must live.

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:30.865
If he dies,

00:08:31.985 --> 00:08:34.144
the deposed emperor's whereabouts
will vanish.

00:08:35.545 --> 00:08:37.985
It'll ruin General Fengshan's grand plan.

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:40.985
It won't be that easy.

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:47.265
The people around him
aren't simpletons either.

00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:03.905
TRAVEL PASS

00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:23.705
Someone close to him

00:09:25.825 --> 00:09:27.505
is already in my control.

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:37.785
The Liu bloodline
isn't so easy to deal with.

00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.065
Ziyan,

00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:43.505
when it comes to killing,

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:46.665
I'm nothing compared to you.

00:09:49.385 --> 00:09:51.705
But when it comes to scheming,

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:56.225
you may not match me.

00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:58.665
You're back.

00:09:58.745 --> 00:09:59.665
-I'm back.
-Here.

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:00.665
Alright.

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.945
IRON

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:10.705
The General's letter.

00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:13.825
Choose the most alert person
to deliver it.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:14.985
Yes.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.545
-Be quick.
-Understood.

00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:54.345
This is what happens when you oppose me.

00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:59.145
From now on,

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:02.985
I am willing to be a slave or a mutt.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:25.505
Back at the Grand Academy,

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.345
every time the teacher scolded you,
you would copy the Shanglin Ode

00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:31.305
so your heart could feel a little lighter.

00:12:32.945 --> 00:12:34.505
After all these years,

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:38.385
you haven't made any progress.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:50.065
You shouldn't have used
your own handwriting.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.425
If someone sharp notices it,

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:54.865
we'll be targeted.

00:12:55.665 --> 00:12:57.745
And Mo is my pageboy.

00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:01.785
A pageboy doesn't need
to write things like this.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:03.465
Then…

00:13:06.065 --> 00:13:07.265
what should I write?

00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:12.625
You should write a letter home.

00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:14.705
Say the business
in the Capital is improving,

00:13:14.785 --> 00:13:16.625
and you'll return after some time.

00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:18.865
As for him and his family,

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:21.865
I'll tell you what to say.

00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:33.865
Mo is my pageboy.

00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:37.625
He grew up with me.

00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:40.505
We studied in the clan school together.

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:45.065
His handwriting

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.505
carries the brushstroke style
of my family.

00:13:50.945 --> 00:13:52.625
Remember this well.

00:13:53.905 --> 00:13:55.545
From now on,

00:13:56.745 --> 00:13:58.425
whenever you write a turning stroke,

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:03.025
slow your brush at the finish.

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.105
His wife is called Yanniang.

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:15.705
She's a fisherwoman.

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.105
Kind-hearted.

00:14:18.785 --> 00:14:20.905
A wonderful cook.

00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:24.345
Yanniang gave him two children.

00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:28.585
A boy who's 6, named Xiaoman.

00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:33.185
A girl who's 4, named Chudong.

00:14:33.905 --> 00:14:35.345
You two, slow down.

00:14:35.425 --> 00:14:37.305
Mo is gentle by nature.

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:39.585
He knows what I'm thinking.

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:43.745
He said he wanted to do his part.

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:47.985
And I agreed.

00:14:50.185 --> 00:14:51.665
But it's all my fault.

00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:55.825
Right now,

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.385
he should be on his way home.

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:05.025
He would've reached home
by the end of the month.

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:11.825
His family lives by a small hill
outside Huzhou.

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:15.265
Three little rooms.

00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:18.465
A modest patch of farmland.

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:20.625
-Dinner's ready!
-Coming!

00:15:22.305 --> 00:15:24.105
It's enough to provide
for the whole family.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.465
He could've lived out his life
safe and sound.

00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:36.305
Mother, we get to eat eggs today!

00:15:42.265 --> 00:15:44.585
But you ruined everything.

00:15:51.665 --> 00:15:52.705
Mo…

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:55.785
Where is he buried?

00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.785
You don't deserve to know.

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.065
If you sit here any longer without a word,

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:37.385
the neighbor lady
is going to come out with a stick.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.105
Alright. I'm coming down.

00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:16.464
So pretty.

00:17:17.145 --> 00:17:18.865
What fabric is this?

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:21.785
Don't touch it.
I'm rushing to finish this.

00:17:21.865 --> 00:17:25.385
If you get it dirty, they'll dock my pay.

00:17:26.665 --> 00:17:30.025
Alright. I won't touch it.
I won't touch it.

00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:31.505
ZHAOLU

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:54.465
Is staring at me
supposed to cook the rice?

00:17:55.785 --> 00:17:56.625
It is.

00:17:57.585 --> 00:17:58.505
I'll cook it.

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:06.545
Come and eat.

00:18:07.265 --> 00:18:08.145
Here.

00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:15.985
-It really is cooked.
-Liu Ziyan is back.

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:24.305
Don't worry.

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:27.345
He calls himself
the Huben Army's top assassin.

00:18:27.425 --> 00:18:29.345
But he's nothing special in my eyes.

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.905
I crossed blades with him last night.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:31.825
I struck him three times.

00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:33.665
Chest, back, left shoulder.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.385
I almost took his head off.

00:18:36.345 --> 00:18:39.985
Too bad… the brat still escaped.

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:41.745
And you?

00:18:43.745 --> 00:18:44.785
Not a scratch on me.

00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:50.025
Why is your clothing torn?

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:02.665
When did my clothes get torn?

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:03.785
-Let me see your wound.
-No.

00:19:05.025 --> 00:19:06.425
Men and women should…

00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:10.865
Let's eat first.

00:19:17.705 --> 00:19:19.905
Consider the silver I paid you earlier

00:19:21.985 --> 00:19:24.185
a payment for
those three strikes last night.

00:19:24.265 --> 00:19:25.105
Alright?

00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:27.385
From now on,

00:19:28.505 --> 00:19:32.225
you don't have to risk your life anymore
to avenge me against Liu Ziyan.

00:19:32.305 --> 00:19:33.665
Why not?

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:38.665
I earn only 100 wen for a wedding quilt,

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:41.025
and 50 wen for a wedding outfit.

00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:44.545
Even if I sew for ten more years,

00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:46.425
I still wouldn't be able
to afford your service.

00:19:47.025 --> 00:19:48.305
I don't want money.

00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:56.305
I don't want money.

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:05.665
Stay away!

00:20:26.065 --> 00:20:27.585
Why do you keep following me?

00:20:33.345 --> 00:20:34.665
Are you good at killing people?

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.545
As you saw. Yes.

00:20:45.985 --> 00:20:48.745
I began sewing to survive when I was 14.

00:20:49.785 --> 00:20:51.985
This is all I've saved
these past five years.

00:20:57.985 --> 00:20:59.265
This is the man's portrait.

00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.905
I want you to kill him.

00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:01.985
Why do you want him dead?

00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:03.985
My mother was a seamstress.

00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:07.105
Every time she finished a garment,

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:09.505
she'd deliver it
to the client's residence.

00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:10.625
That winter solstice,

00:21:11.225 --> 00:21:14.185
she braved the snow
and brought a newly finished cloak

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:16.345
to Liu Ziyan's residence.

00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:23.865
But Liu Ziyan accused her of being a spy
who eavesdropped for secrets.

00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:27.865
Liu Ziyan hung my mother
right at our doorstep.

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:32.865
When she died,
even her kneecaps were carved out.

00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:42.185
This is the deposit.
I'll make up the rest someday.

00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:46.705
I don't kill for money.

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:54.105
A deposit, though…

00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:07.705
Give me a smile first.

00:22:25.505 --> 00:22:27.185
What you just said…

00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:29.705
were you feeling sorry for me?

00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:34.545
I was worried about you.

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:38.425
What's there to worry about?

00:22:38.505 --> 00:22:40.825
I made you a promise, so I'll get it done.

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:47.265
Also, from now on,
don't bring up the money again.

00:22:48.505 --> 00:22:49.945
You've already paid.

00:23:11.305 --> 00:23:12.625
Fresh vegetables!

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:14.545
Come take a look!

00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:16.305
Crisp and tender greens!

00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:18.905
Come look!

00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:22.865
-Come take a look.
-Fresh greens today.

00:23:22.945 --> 00:23:24.585
I picked them this morning.

00:23:24.665 --> 00:23:26.745
-Come look.
-I'll take one.

00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:28.425
Take care, miss.

00:23:32.065 --> 00:23:33.265
Very nice.

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:35.785
-These are handwoven by us.
-This one.

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:36.705
-This looks good.
-It suits you.

00:23:36.785 --> 00:23:37.625
-Alright.
-The silver one is nice.

00:23:37.705 --> 00:23:38.745
I'll take that one then.

00:23:39.545 --> 00:23:40.745
Miss, want to look at kites?

00:23:40.825 --> 00:23:43.065
-How much is this?
-Two wen.

00:23:46.145 --> 00:23:47.225
-Here.
-Thank you.

00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:35.945
Pick some more.

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:37.185
They're very fresh.

00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:53.265
If you ever run into danger,
you can let a paper kite fly.

00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:55.825
I have plenty of eyes and ears
in the city.

00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:57.105
They will tell me right away.

00:25:00.345 --> 00:25:01.425
Thank you.

00:25:01.505 --> 00:25:03.785
Sesame oil.

00:25:03.865 --> 00:25:05.585
It flies really high.

00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:07.945
Come take a look.

00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:13.025
-Sesame oil.
-This one.

00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:15.185
-I'll take one.
-Alright.

00:25:15.265 --> 00:25:16.385
Pears!

00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:18.985
Xiaoqing, why aren't you…

00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:20.825
I'm never buying pears from you again.

00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:26.345
This girl… What's gotten into her today?

00:25:27.665 --> 00:25:28.945
Thank you, miss.

00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:30.985
Take care. Come again next time.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:34.545
Rain capes! Selling rain capes!

00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:36.425
Rain capes!

00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:37.785
-Go over there.
-Yes.

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:38.905
Go.

00:26:30.345 --> 00:26:31.865
You're sharp.

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.985
You could tell
those men outside were mine.

00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:38.585
Has no one ever told you

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:42.745
you don't need to act
so high and mighty all the time?

00:26:45.665 --> 00:26:48.625
You know, I grew up without parents.

00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:51.705
I was raised being beaten
in an opera troupe.

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:56.545
My masters told me
when you live in this world,

00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:59.505
every movement onstage,

00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:02.225
every frown and smile
is something people have to watch.

00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:04.985
If anyone found it displeasing,

00:27:05.585 --> 00:27:07.385
my masters would beat me.

00:27:08.225 --> 00:27:11.465
So I've had to watch myself
every moment of every day.

00:27:11.545 --> 00:27:14.105
Regardless of whom I'm performing for.

00:27:23.905 --> 00:27:26.065
The kite flew away.

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:30.465
Which means you're not leaving.

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:34.345
The night Mr. Yu died,

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:37.265
you didn't even give me two hours.

00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:39.865
Why would you give me two days?

00:27:50.825 --> 00:27:52.585
You're worthless.

00:27:52.665 --> 00:27:55.505
But the person you were writing to
has value of his own.

00:28:09.985 --> 00:28:11.825
I was only bait.

00:28:54.225 --> 00:28:55.745
I saw that. What are your hands doing?

00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:05.265
Split this bundle,
then split the next two days' worth.

00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:07.225
I'll check before dark.

00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:34.545
Assassin! There's an assassin!

00:29:36.865 --> 00:29:37.785
Where?

00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:43.465
The assassin you're talking about is her?

00:29:44.305 --> 00:29:46.585
What are you yelling for?
Get back to work.

00:29:49.865 --> 00:29:51.785
Why are you here? What's the rush?

00:29:51.865 --> 00:29:52.825
What happened?

00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:55.945
It's Bai Wan. Something happened to her.

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:30.825
The Huben Army.

00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:32.105
Xiaoqing was followed on her way back.

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:33.945
They surrounded the courtyard.

00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:35.945
Wait.

00:30:36.025 --> 00:30:37.705
Is there a secret tunnel or a hidden room?

00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:38.665
No.

00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:40.585
They brought many men.

00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:43.465
The only ones here who can fight
are Xiaoqing and me.

00:30:45.985 --> 00:30:48.625
I caused this mess. I'll deal with it.

00:30:54.545 --> 00:30:56.985
Fire. Burn the walls first.

00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:22.665
I can't get out.
And no one is coming to save me.

00:31:23.785 --> 00:31:26.265
To you, I'm useless.

00:31:26.345 --> 00:31:27.945
Stop wasting time.

00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:30.065
How is it a waste?

00:31:31.025 --> 00:31:33.025
Maybe you don't know this yet.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.705
The person you were writing to
is already back in Chang'an.

00:31:38.305 --> 00:31:40.465
And what you definitely don't know

00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:43.665
is that your little messenger
was still being watched,

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:48.065
even if you two had your little tricks.

00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:55.225
All it takes is one trip
to where he lives.

00:31:55.305 --> 00:31:57.225
Once she does that,

00:31:58.185 --> 00:31:59.345
his location

00:32:00.945 --> 00:32:02.785
is exposed.

00:32:58.985 --> 00:33:00.705
-Don't let a single one escape!
-Yes.

00:34:22.705 --> 00:34:25.585
I'm going to save her.
Break through, then go find Mr. Long.

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:27.105
Stay alive.

00:35:23.465 --> 00:35:27.385
Wherever you go, write to me.

00:35:28.225 --> 00:35:31.745
Let me know you're safe every year.

00:35:31.825 --> 00:35:33.825
YOUNG BAI WAN

00:35:33.905 --> 00:35:36.985
I only want to know
that he's safe every year.

00:35:37.865 --> 00:35:40.185
So all these years,
I've kept writing to him.

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:44.105
Seeing him all alone,
he seemed a little pitiful.

00:35:45.225 --> 00:35:46.985
All these years of writing,

00:35:47.505 --> 00:35:51.305
I only wanted him to know
that someone is thinking of him.

00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:05.305
Still alive, I see.

00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:20.665
Go!

00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:24.625
Go.
