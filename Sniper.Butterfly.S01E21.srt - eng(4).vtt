00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.200
Why do I have to wait another month

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.020
for a break

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.860
when you're already heading home?

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.844
Yanbei University always
has its semester breaks early.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.610
Now you're just gloating.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.740
No.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.040
I just wanted to see

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.860
what your and Li Wu's campus looks like.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.220
Well, this is it.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.020
Looks nice.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.250
So, are you free this Saturday?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.660
Cheng Rui.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:13.620
Liu Ying.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.000
Are you free

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.430
this Saturday?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.000
I'd like to buy you a meal

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.220
and ask you something.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.970
Yeah, I'm free.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.430
If you're buying,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.840
of course, I'm free.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.190
It's a promise, then.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.560
I'll send you the time

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.380
and place.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.080
Okay.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.620
See you.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.220
See you around!

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.620
Well?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.100
She's the belle of our course.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.940
Pretty, right?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.250
She's all right.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.780
Just all right?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.850
Wen.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.530
- Li Wu.
- Li Wu.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.680
It's been a while.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.410
Long time no see.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.810
You're late.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.000
You just missed

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.810
the highlight of my life.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.970
What happened?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.430
The belle of my course asked me out.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.460
She asked me.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.730
Right?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.800
Li Wu,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.940
are you free this Saturday?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.900
I don't have plans yet.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.780
Then let's watch this together.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.180
(Heartstrings Orchestra)

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.570
What are these?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.220
Tickets to the city orchestra's
tour concert.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.400
I heard

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.590
they're really good.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.955
The tickets were hard to get.

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.533
Is Cheng Rui not joining us?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.620
He has a date with a beauty.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.410
And with his taste,

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:35.940
it'd be wasted on him anyway.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.900
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.290
All right.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.180
Li Wu!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.970
We need to talk.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.010
What's up?

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:11.190
Have you and Wen been talking

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.180
behind my back?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.290
No.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:15.680
Then why'd she only ask you to go

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.780
to the concert with her?

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.530
Well, don't you have a date

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.530
with someone else?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.850
Tell her I can't make it.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.820
I need to work at the shop.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.100
Then why'd you say yes just now?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.244
I didn't want to make things awkward

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:40.100
for her.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.370
Look at you understanding social cues.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.560
But if you back out,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.050
she's going to be alone.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.260
Fine then, I'll go.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.970
Don't.

00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:50.170
Give me the ticket.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.490
You don't need to go.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.800
You've been working

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.160
a lot lately.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.666
How many shifts do you have a week?

00:04:58.666 --> 00:04:59.977
Just once a week.

00:04:59.977 --> 00:05:01.800
Saturday was supposed
to be someone else's shift,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.700
but he swapped with me.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.340
I'm heading off.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.044
We'll put this prop over here.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.240
There's not enough on that side.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.430
Okay.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.300
We'll add a few more.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.720
These are the products.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.155
There'll be one, two, three, four,

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:18.070
and our model will touch the numbers.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.111
When he touches number one,
number one will open.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.820
Followed

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.580
by number four.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.830
And last

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.850
is number two.

00:05:26.377 --> 00:05:27.660
Then, he covers his ears.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.820
Good. That should work.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.070
Jin,

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.190
the model we booked

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.310
has an eye infection.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.533
He's at the hospital right now.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.830
Even if he can come,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.100
he can't wear our contacts.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.100
Any backups?

00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:40.022
I asked Li Fei to check the talent group.

00:05:40.022 --> 00:05:42.190
There are no models
who meet the appearance requirements

00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:43.659
and have a schedule that lines up.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.610
What do we do?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.800
Ask the agent

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.310
if there's anyone

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.666
in the student part-time groups.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.680
About 185cm, nice eyes,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.133
and needs to get here immediately.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:56.480
Got it. I'll check with them now.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.070
Who ordered

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.660
the milk tea?

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.480
We did.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.530
Thanks. I'll take that.

00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:02.290
Forget the call.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.600
We have a candidate right here.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.490
I need a favor.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.020
What?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.730
Sit.

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:16.400
Start doing his hair and makeup.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.333
Make it quick. Can you
get him ready in 30 minutes?

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:18.866
No problem.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.830
Great.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.220
But...

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.290
Keep scrolling.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.900
Okay. Stop.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.360
Jin! The owner of Meete Store said

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.120
the guy can stay

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.000
and help us

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.270
since we always

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.140
give them business.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.340
Perfect.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.750
Attention, everyone!

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.390
We're shooting in 15 minutes!

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.160
Move fast!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.460
- Got it!
- Got it!

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.580
Let's continue.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.490
Scroll up.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.560
Can you get him ready

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.310
in five minutes?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.900
No problem.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.220
Thanks.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.900
(Control yourself.)

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.020
(You looked at me first.)

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.190
So I think

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.120
we can switch these two.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.750
From this angle.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.100
Right.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.050
Does this work?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.780
This will do.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.390
Okay.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.190
I'll do it that way.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.680
Okay.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.170
All right.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.660
Li Wu.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.820
(Dressing Room A)

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.730
Where is everyone?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.020
No idea.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.040
Are you almost done?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.020
Do you need help?

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.911
What are you doing?

00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:40.666
If you're changed,
you should've just gone out.

00:08:45.022 --> 00:08:46.400
What are you trying to do?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.820
Cut it out!

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.940
There are people outside!

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.490
Where are the non-prescription lenses?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.270
I think I left them inside.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.010
I'll look.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.870
Found them.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.540
They were here.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.340
Let's go.

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:14.940
Get the model to put them on.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.180
Where is he?

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.300
You're annoying.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.650
Li Wu,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.000
here's how this shot will go.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.100
The lights around the door

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.490
will turn on.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.550
Then the boards representing
your ears, mouth,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.770
and eyes will slide open.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.000
Then they close again,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.370
leaving only your eyes.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.940
You need to look into the camera

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.610
and show affection.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.000
Okay?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.890
Behind that door?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.150
Yes, behind that door.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.610
Okay.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.490
Di!

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.370
We can start.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.250
Okay, Director.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.940
Everyone on set, ready!

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.100
Shake the balls.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.580
Roll the cameras!

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.060
Rolling!

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.630
Three, two, one!

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.420
Action!

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.220
(Close your mouth. Cover your ears.
Let the affection show in your eyes.)

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.010
Okay. Cut!

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.250
Li Wu! Li Wu.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.150
That take was good.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.300
Let's adjust a bit.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.200
Next time,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.700
don't let your eyes wander.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.940
Look into the lens with affection.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.850
Okay?

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.240
Okay.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.288
All right. One more take.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.060
Everyone on set, ready!

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.960
Three, two, one!

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.700
Action!

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.270
♪A butterfly flapping its wings♪

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.777
(Let the affection show in your eyes.)

00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:40.070
♪Breaking through the cocoon
that once bound it♪

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:49.410

♪Hold my hand tight, don't get lost♪

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.010
Thanks.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.340
Take a seat.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.250
Okay.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.340
Hello.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.370
Welcome.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.840
Can you adjust the air conditioner

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.200
so it doesn't blow straight at us?

00:12:52.244 --> 00:12:54.100
It's a little chilly.

00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:55.200
Of course. Sorry about that.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.866
One moment.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.770
Here's our menu.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.340
Take a look at the menu.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.300
It's fine.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.960
This is my first time here.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960
I don't know what's good.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.750
You decide.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.240
All right.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.460
I'll just order a few things.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.540
(Well?)

00:13:20.644 --> 00:13:21.911
(Did you go to the concert?)

00:13:28.022 --> 00:13:29.180
(Are you all by yourself?)

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.120
How about these?

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.300
Do we need anything else?

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.180
No.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.300
It's fine.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.730
I trust your choices.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.190
All right. We'll start with these.
If it's not enough, we'll order more.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.622
Okay. Your food will be ready soon.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.940
Here is your food.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.820
Enjoy.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.650
Thank you.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.770
Thank you.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.620
(Voice Call)

00:14:02.644 --> 00:14:03.466
What do you think?

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:04.940
The food's nice, right?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.730
It's delicious.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.890
Have some more.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.700
I asked you out

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.770
(Wen)
because I wanted to ask something.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.490
So...

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.620
(Hang Up)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.650
Does Li Wu have a girlfriend?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.240
I'm sorry.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.870
Something urgent came up. I need to go.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.666
This meal's on me.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.800
Enjoy the food. I have to go.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.222
Wait...

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.577
Maybe we can set up another date.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.200
Sorry.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.850
I'm so sorry.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.250
Wait...

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:49.980
(Grand Theater Entrance)

00:14:51.288 --> 00:14:52.600
I... I'm looking for someone.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.066
I can't let you in without a ticket.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.688
I have a ticket. Hold on.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.010
What's going on with you?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.720
I called a bunch of times.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.577
You didn't pick up.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.390
Where are you?

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.300
Right here.

00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:15.200
What are you doing still out here?

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.730
You're always early.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.130
Why are you here?

00:15:18.622 --> 00:15:20.580
I thought you had a date
with your course belle.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.060
What do you think?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.000
I texted you so many times.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.290
You didn't reply to any of them.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.510
I thought Li Wu turned you down

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.320
and you were

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.770
hiding somewhere crying.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.060
Why would I cry?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.730
Aren't you into Li Wu...

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.460
What's going on in that head of yours?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.370
Why would I ever have a crush on Li Wu?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.550
I just had an extra ticket

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.840
and didn't know who to invite.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.420
Li Wu's the only reliable option.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.970
You should've said so.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.320
I thought you got dumped

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.850
and bailed on my date.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.650
Then leave.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.370
I'm already here.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.700
Why should I leave now?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.610
Let's head in.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.440
Don't leave halfway,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440
don't look at your phone,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.390
and don't fall asleep.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.240
Tickets, please.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.340
Got it.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.060
(Grand Theater Entrance)

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.720
Cen Jin,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.700
it's settled then.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.220
Once I'm back from the trip,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.750
we'll grab dinner
and go over everything in detail.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.910
Sure thing.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.010
After you.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.970
Mr. Li,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.440
we'll stay in touch.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.250
All right.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.790
Bye.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.100
Goodbye.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.730
Hi!

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.890
Haven't seen you in a while.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.360
Congratulations, Jin!

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.100
Thank you.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.810
How've you been?

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.970
Congratulations.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.360
Thank you.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.600
Looking forward to working together.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.340
Keep your mind where it needs to be.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.300
Since the G series campaign,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.750
AusStar, thanks to Cen Jin,

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.844
has pulled several contracts out
from under us.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.300
Here. To better days for us.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.540
What a coincidence.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.450
Those past few adverts were pretty good.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.540
Thank you.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.350
That artist collab makeup short

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.550
from AusStar last week

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.540
was yours, right?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.070
Do you need something?

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.260
The concept was mine.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.020
I pitched it.

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:41.170
And you got all the credit.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.590
I was just doing what the client

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.890
and the boss wanted.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.350
Didn't expect you to say that.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.640
If you've got any complaints,
take them up with the client.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.310
I was wondering

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.160
why Ted's work

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.170
suddenly tanked enough

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.260
to produce that mess.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.170
Call it what it is. You're a thief.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.750
I remember

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.270
when you used

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.780
to be proud and idealistic.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.690
But it seems

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.980
you're starting
to compromise with the real world.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.580
Relax.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.000
I'll never

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.540
put that case in my portfolio

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.450
because it's cheap work,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.890
inside and out.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.740
I know you're drunk

00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:34.266
and can't control your temper.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.450
But the concept came

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.850
from the client.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.890
If you're mad

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.780
because it came from your ex-husband,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.580
I get it.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.030
But you know

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.444
we don't get to make decisions.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.740
We execute

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.780
what the client wants.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.580
You've got ideals.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.500
You aim high.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.550
Sometimes,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.340
it's not creativity that makes a brand.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.340
It's the brand

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.370
that gives us room to create.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400
Your ex-husband

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.540
is something else though.

00:19:08.777 --> 00:19:10.222
If he thought his idea was all that,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.210
why isn't he going after the client?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.100
It would be even more ridiculous

00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:17.022
if you walked straight into his trap.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.650
I just feel like

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.060
I was kept in the dark.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.980
No one kept you in the dark.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.440
Clients don't owe us

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.020
full disclosure.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.820
Right?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.020
And the same goes
for me as your supervisor.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.880
I don't have

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.170
to tell you everything either.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.980
But I always thought

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.820
AusStar's greatest value

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.110
was our creativity.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.850
Creativity only matters

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.300
when we can carry it out,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.200
and when there is enough funding

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.130
and the right platform
to make it happen.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.170
Otherwise,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.130
a great idea is just an idea.

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:52.644
You've worked your way up
to where you are.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.260
You can't run on ideals alone.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.410
I like you,

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.400
but you're also

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.244
the most difficult kind of people
to work with.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.820
(Sister, are you done with work?)

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.580
(Where are you?)

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.130
(I'll pick you up.)

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.610
Don't move.

00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:18.500
Just let me lean on you for a bit.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.890
What's wrong?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.020
Did you cry?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.100
No.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.450
I just feel a little blue.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.260
Why'd you drink so much?

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.060
What happened?

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.300
Just work stuff.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.100
Stuff I hate

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.450
but can't avoid.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.370
You need to study hard.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.340
Don't rush into working.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.450
The real world

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.130
eats you alive.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.960
There are

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.260
so many things you can't control.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.890
But I want to start working sooner.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.690
If not,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.920
how long will it take

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.170
till I can protect you

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.100
and marry you?

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.340
What are you talking about?

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.720
Are you even

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.890
old enough to get married?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:37.980
I...

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.930
will be.

00:22:42.222 --> 00:22:43.240
Assuming you still want

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.780
to be with me when the time comes.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.130
Why are you so pessimistic?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.450
I'm not that fickle.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.060
Let's go inside.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.020
I'll help you.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.880
Lie down for a bit.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.688
I'll make you something
to help you sober up.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.270
I think you're in some sort

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.540
of avant-garde relationship.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.070
What are you talking about?

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.650
Your water.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.790
Thank you.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.740
I don't get you.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.100
You two

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.260
just started dating.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.980
You should be all over each other.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.830
Why'd you send him back

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.820
to his dorm?

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.780
You two are trying out
long distance or something?

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.650
Stop teasing me.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.310
Li Wu has projects

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.500
and lab work.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.820
And...

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.540
And what?

00:24:44.622 --> 00:24:46.888
Living together makes it too easy
to get carried away.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.580
Do you see this?

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.240
Chills.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.750
Really?

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.210
Stop showing off your romance!

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.020
Anyway,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.400
I've been thinking

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.580
about something.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.650
What?

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.920
How to give your lover

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.170
the sweetest romance?

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:10.720
Cut it out!

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.640
Stop filling your mind

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.890
with all that nonsense.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.850
I meant

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.450
I'm thinking about starting

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.210
my own independent creative agency
or an MCN company.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.720
Where'd that come from?

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.500
You already made it
to creative director.

00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.690
Now you want to start over from scratch?

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.880
I thought about it

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.740
when I left Yiwen.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.400
But things went well at AusStar,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.300
and I did enjoy it,

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.880
so I shelved

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.740
the idea.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.890
Then the Wu Fu situation

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.820
snapped me awake.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.350
If no one can give me

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.610
the platform I want,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.260
I'll build my own.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.610
30 years old and so ambitious, huh?

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.340
I used to think

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.890
I was the core.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.850
But lately,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.580
I realized

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.580
I'm just a part, a tiny gear.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.510
Turning and turning,

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.030
executing, completing,
getting rejected, getting praised.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.160
The cycle repeats.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.980
And replaceable any day.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.270
I've got

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.740
no real say in anything.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.200
Wu Fu used to say I had no worries

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.355
and nothing holding me back.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.644
I argued with him at the time.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.450
But looking back,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.300
maybe he wasn't wrong.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.550
So when are you

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.820
planning to start this business?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.610
There's no rush.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.020
I want to build some connections first.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.510
A partner

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.750
I used to work well with

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.690
started her own thing.

00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:34.130
I want to talk to her first.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.820
I'll be looking forward

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.170
to see the platform
you build for yourself.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.130
Cheers!

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.260
(Brother, Video Call)

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.460
(The receiver
has switched to voice call)

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.060
(Brother)

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.500
(Hold on.)

00:27:34.977 --> 00:27:35.890
(What are you doing?)

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.980
(I'm in the library. Give me a moment.)

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.160
I just left the library.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.444
I'm heading back to the dorm.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.590
Watch where you're going.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.610
Don't run into a tree.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.170
All right.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.650
You look really good.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.930
Why'd you call all of a sudden?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.960
No reason.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.540
Just wanted to see you.

00:28:22.044 --> 00:28:23.450
Are you coming home this weekend?

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.650
I can come home right now.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.690
Keep dreaming.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.170
Li Wu!

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.020
It really is you.

00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:35.350
You were staring at your phone.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.070
I was only sure

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.060
once I got close.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.020
What are you doing?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.030
Cheng Rui said

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.130
you were in the library.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.680
I'm on a video call

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.540
with my girlfriend.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.300
Then...

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.100
I'll leave you to it.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:04.500
(Library)

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.300
(Why'd you hang up?)

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.850
(You were talking to your coursemate.)

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.819
(She's the class representative.)

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.380
(We only exchanged a couple of words.)

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.340
(Got it.)

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.650
(I've got work to do.)

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.410
(Are you jealous?)

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.820
(Why would I be?
It was a normal conversation.)

00:29:55.911 --> 00:29:57.500
(Then I'll talk to her more next time.)

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.370
(You wouldn't dare.)

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.756
(Why would I be?
It was a normal conversation.)

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.940
(You wouldn't dare.)

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.820
Li Wu,

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:31.550
maybe grin in the hallway
if you need to.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.866
Come back when you're done.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.650
Li Wu!

00:30:47.622 --> 00:30:49.130
You're dating someone, aren't you?

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.210
You think so?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.260
He looks like he is.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.650
He was smiling like that
in the lab a few days ago.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.850
If you put it that way,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.580
he's very suspicious.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:06.720
See?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.680
Oh, my!

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.260
This came out of nowhere!

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.160
You...

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.310
Way to go, dude!

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.830
Who is she?

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.000
Is she from our university?

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.820
No...

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.170
But she used to be.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.210
Who is she?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.210
Do we know her?

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.020
It's...

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.640
That lady you all met

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.370
when we first

00:31:27.888 --> 00:31:28.780
started university.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.740
The pretty lady!

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.550
I knew last year

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.270
there was something going on.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:35.820
You...

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.300
Cheng Rui knew, didn't he?

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.911
And he didn't tell us anything!

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:39.930
Come on.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.340
How'd she get you?

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.850
I asked her out.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.133
That's our overachiever.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.000
So, what's it like dating an older lady?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.780
It must be amazing.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.880
Totally.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.920
Come on, tell us.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.020
We've never dated one.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.820
Tell us about it.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.020
I... I need to catch up on my reading.

00:31:58.688 --> 00:31:59.550
Don't be like that.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.350
Don't do this to us.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.440
Right. Just tell us.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.000
Come on!

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.890
Knock it off!

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.060
Boring.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.410
Buzzkill.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.890
What are you looking at?

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.690
My paper passed review.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.170
What paper?

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.020
The topic Professor Zhang gave me.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.680
Yiyang helped me revise it

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.240
and suggested

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.170
I submit it to CSSCI.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.020
Wow!

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.890
That's huge!

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.850
Keep your voice down.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.580
Why would I keep it down?

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.410
A paper accepted by CSSCI!

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.980
That's something

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.780
to brag about!

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:47.740
Right.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.650
I'll tell the guys in the dorm.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.500
We'll throw a feast for you tonight.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.550
Li Wu.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.060
Which one of you is Li Wu?

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.100
That's me.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.500
Li Wu, the director wants to see you.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.300
The director?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.260
Sounds like good news.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.270
How do you know?

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.088
If they're looking for you,
it's good news.

00:33:11.088 --> 00:33:12.890
If they're looking for me,
that's another story.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.340
So are we celebrating you or not?

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:29.100
(Head of Department Office)

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.500
Director.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.750
Li Wu.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:35.850
Come in and have a seat.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.850
Your paper passed the review.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.020
Congratulations.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.300
Thank you, Sir.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.340
I asked you here today

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.830
because I have more good news

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.650
to share.

00:33:49.444 --> 00:33:50.410
Here's the situation.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.480
Our department

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.060
has two full scholarships
for an exchange program in the US this year.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.410
You've been one of our top students

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.130
since the day you joined us.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.740
You also have

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.000
a paper coming out

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.690
in a journal.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.350
You're a great fit

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.820
for this program.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.330
The university wants you
to have this opportunity.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.888
We haven't partnered

00:34:10.888 --> 00:34:12.755
with the University of Pennsylvania
for years.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.060
The policy lined up this time

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.060
and it's a full scholarship.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.880
Pick a topic

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.190
from your current work,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.840
put together

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.610
a research plan,

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.610
and submit it.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.350
I trust that won't be a problem.

00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:24.977
Of course.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.440
Sir,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.250
how long would we be gone?

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.580
When would we leave?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.500
You...

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.760
I just want to know

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.630
the duration of the program

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.690
and the departure date.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.610
If the paperwork goes smoothly,

00:34:48.644 --> 00:34:50.511
you'll leave at the start
of your sophomore year.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.540
The program lasts two years.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.920
Would I be able

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.170
to come back in between?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.480
Your seniors all felt

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.670
their time there

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.500
wasn't enough.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.650
What's the matter?

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.330
You want time to come home?

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.230
Of course.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.244
If you really want to come back,
it's not impossible.

00:35:17.266 --> 00:35:20.020
However, the academic
exchange visa is tied

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.290
to the program.

00:35:21.777 --> 00:35:23.466
You only get
a limited number of entries.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.630
If you want

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.730
to come back midway,

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.130
it might

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.420
get complicated.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.330
Do you have concerns?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.580
It's just

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.770
a bit sudden.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.690
You're young.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.710
You should

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.244
get out there more and push yourself.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.960
It'll broaden your horizon

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.860
and mind.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.580
That'll help you in the long run.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.630
And once you have

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.540
experience abroad,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.020
it will help you

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.580
whether you pursue further study

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.810
or look for work.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.760
Everyone is fighting

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.730
for this chance.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.100
Why don't you

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.440
go home and talk it over

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.330
with your family?

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.710
Give me

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.690
a clear answer soon.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.580
All right.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.266
(There's something I'd like to...)

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.730
Come in.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.250
Boss.

00:37:37.577 --> 00:37:39.700
(Jingman Cosmetics and Artists
Collaboration Proposal)

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.940
What's this?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.250
The collaboration proposal
with the artists.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.540
I made some changes.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.110
Wu Fu's idea falls apart

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.550
the moment you look closely.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.610
It's outdated.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.111
The market is saturated

00:37:59.133 --> 00:38:00.210
with similar concepts.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.730
It has no originality to speak of.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.670
I thought

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.380
we already made things clear
the other day.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.170
And I said

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.290
I didn't agree.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.250
Shooting with that concept

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.000
is a waste of resources.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Did it cross your mind

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.170
that what you call outdated

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.840
might be what the client sees

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.420
as safe and reliable?

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.000
Don't get stuck in your own head.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.110
You should

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.190
focus more

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.460
on the Bei'ao Motors project.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.250
And keep typing for Song Yang?

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.130
Someone's upset.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.650
We're basically doing assembly work

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.000
for Bei'ao Motors

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.900
at this point.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.000
We have no room

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.250
to do anything creative.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.100
It puts us in a passive spot.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.622
If this keeps up,

00:38:46.688 --> 00:38:48.730
we'll be pushed out of the core project

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.190
or even replaced

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.960
by another company.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.510
Aren't you

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.540
overthinking it?

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.460
Maybe you're just tired.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.940
How about I give you a day off

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.250
to rest?

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.622
Don't stress yourself out.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.980
Anything else?

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.580
No.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.810
You're back.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.650
I came to pick up my clothes.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.360
You came all the way back

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.500
just for that?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.940
I wanted to see you.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.590
I waited all day for you.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.860
Why'd you come back so late?

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.500
I'm exhausted.

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.911
Let me lie down on your lap for a bit.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.190
You've been worn out

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.130
from work lately.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.860
Want to talk about it?

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840
I don't want to bring

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.630
my work stress home

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.420
to you.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.420
What do you want to hear?

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:11.290
Me trash-talking clients?

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.440
Media?

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.460
My boss?

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.980
Anything.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.980
And what if this keeps happening?

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.110
Would you really put up

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.580
with being my emotional bin forever?

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.670
I don't want to gossip

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.610
behind people's backs.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.860
It makes me feel small.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.330
Just this is fine.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.860
Just you holding me like this.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:47.940
Li Wu,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.690
I might be jobless soon.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.290
You're quitting?

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.980
I tend to act on impulse.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.800
If you were me,

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.730
what would you do?

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.170
You already know your answer.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.580
Whatever you choose,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.020
I'm with you.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.920
(Cheng Rui: Li Wu, are you going to Penn
for the exchange program?)

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.955
(I told you the director
had good news for you!)

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.210
Don't you want to read that?

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.170
It's fine.

00:42:33.288 --> 00:42:34.100
It's just Cheng Rui.

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:35.690
He wanted to talk about something.
