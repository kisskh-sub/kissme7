Darn it. What is this?

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:22.355
Hey, you jerks! Time to make some money!

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:54.795
What is it?

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.425
One of the sites you set up back in Korea was shut down.

00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:58.565
Shut down?

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.165
That was my first project in Korea.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.135
Who was in charge of this one again?

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.635
Hang on. That coach.

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:16.445
Where did they...

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:17.885
Please...

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:24.955
Right. Seong Uk.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.865
Hey, Seong Uk. It's been a while. This is Gwang Jin.

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:40.035
This can't be right. Only we knew about this. Right?

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:43.175
Seong Uk, you need to calm down.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:45.105
But I just got here.

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:46.875
I'll go check for myself.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.635
You had me so worried! Darn it.

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:21.775
Hey, I found him. Min Ho was right here.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.315
So you dug him up yourself just to make sure.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:31.485
No, that's not it.

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:33.185
Let's meet face-to-face soon.

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.965
Get ready. We're making a quick trip to Korea.

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:45.465

Okay, that's a wrap.

- Gosh, I'm nervous. - Play well, everyone.

00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:59.105
Let's go practice. We need to prepare for the match.

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:01.615
- We've got to crush them. - We're awesome.

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:02.714
- We should work hard. - Yes?

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.485
- Play well. - Thank you. I won't let you down.

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:06.315

Why aren't you picking one?

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.174
I'm fine, thanks. I'm just looking.

00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:31.575
This is my treat to make sure you win the next match.

00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.815
- Just pick one. - No, really, I'm fine.

00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:36.415
Gosh, you're so darn stubborn.

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:39.614
Hey, look at these shoes. Don't they reek?

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:41.985
- Sir. - Sir, we've each picked a pair.

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:45.185
They're pro volleyball shoes, so they're a little expensive.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:49.625
- Right. - Not "sir." Call me Gwang Jin.

00:05:50.325 --> 00:05:52.765
Not you, though. People might get the wrong idea.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:53.935
Okay.

00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:59.765
Hey. You guys picked out some really expensive ones.

00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:02.134
- Then we can pick something else... - Something else?

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:03.175
Well...

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.345
You guys are killing me. Go on, get three more pairs of them.

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:09.315
- For Min Ho too. - Thank you!

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.375
No.

00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:13.685
- I really don't need them. - Well, I'm not okay with that.

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.015
Hey, why are you being so...

00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:17.115
Hey, take him and help him find his size.

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:19.355
- No. I'm really okay. - Got it, Gwang Jin.

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:20.955
- Just come on. - Really, it's fine.

00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:22.025
You're a size ten, right?

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:23.295
Hey.

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:25.125
Yes?

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:31.035
Hey, I told you I'm really fine.

00:06:31.105 --> 00:06:33.535
Darn, it's a perfect fit.

00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:35.035
Hey, you should just get this one too.

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:36.575
Let's all get matching pairs.

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:39.275
- With Seong Uk and me. - All right?

00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:41.345

(Jingwang University)

00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:49.255
- Mine! - Mine!

00:06:50.155 --> 00:06:51.185
What was that?

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:54.025
- My bad. - Seong Uk, focus!

00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:55.355
Let's go!

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.295
All right, let's get this one!

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.504
Second set, double contact fault.

00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:15.675
Third set, two failed receives.

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:17.885
Wait, weren't there two service aces?

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:22.155
Gwang Jin is going to flip out on us for not following his orders.

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:24.885
The least he could do is write it so I can actually read it.

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:27.725
- You should've read it right! - You try reading it.

00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:28.795
What are you guys doing?

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:31.265
Hey, Min Ho.

00:07:31.965 --> 00:07:32.965
What's that you're hiding?

00:07:33.395 --> 00:07:35.435
- It's nothing. - What, did you get a love letter?

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:37.535
Let me see.

00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:42.205
(2nd set: Double contact fault, 3rd set: Two failed receives)

00:07:42.275 --> 00:07:46.844
Stop, you're being embarrassing. We were just talking something over.

00:07:46.845 --> 00:07:49.014
Yes, that's right. We were just going over...

00:07:49.015 --> 00:07:50.245
the mistakes we made today.

00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:54.655
Going over?

00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:57.785
You mean you weren't just following instructions?

00:07:58.685 --> 00:07:59.985
- Darn it. - No.

00:08:00.485 --> 00:08:01.495
Min Ho.

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:06.025
What has gotten into you guys?

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:17.775
- Seong Uk. What are we going to do? - What else can we do?

00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:34.525
Seriously, what am I going to do?

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:43.835
We need to talk.

00:08:44.765 --> 00:08:45.765
Get in.

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:01.815
Did you settle things with your dad using the money I gave you?

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:04.755
Yes.

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.925
- I was grateful for your help. - Think nothing of it.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.955
If you ever need help, just let me know.

00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:13.865
The best way to be a good son is to keep training hard as you are.

00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:17.265
You need to go pro, make big money, and take care of your dad.

00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:21.005
Who even goes to watch repair shops anymore?

00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:22.535
Right?

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:28.375
The thing is, I've been in a tough spot lately,

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:32.245
and Seong Uk and Dong Hyeon understood and helped me out a lot.

00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:34.855
They're really good kids.

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:38.425
I don't think I've ever asked you for anything, have I, Min Ho?

00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:41.955
So, think you could help me out too?

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:44.965
You want me to do as you say...

00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:47.025
and fix the match?

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:48.695
I'm not telling you to lose the game.

00:09:49.595 --> 00:09:52.865
Do me 1 or 2 favors, then go back to playing to win.

00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:53.935
Nothing changes.

00:09:55.005 --> 00:09:56.005
I will...

00:10:00.045 --> 00:10:01.045
help you out.

00:10:01.575 --> 00:10:04.485
Okay? All the way to the V-League. No.

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:07.145
Until your playing career is over. Okay?

00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:10.615
I'm going to report you to the police.

00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:13.085
For match-fixing.

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:16.555
You don't want to do that.

00:10:18.725 --> 00:10:20.195
Weren't you pretty quick to take my money?

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:22.695
I wouldn't have taken the darn money if I knew this was what you wanted!

00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:25.735
And who's going to believe you? Everyone knows how close we are.

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:28.475
I'm your official sponsor.

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:30.635
Let's say you do report me.

00:10:34.215 --> 00:10:35.315
You'd be an accomplice.

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:39.945
Then I'll take the punishment right along with you.

00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:41.285
You idiot.

00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:44.125
You've watched too many dramas, Min Ho.

00:10:44.855 --> 00:10:46.125
You think you're the hero of some story?

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.625
So you're saying you're willing to ruin your two friends' lives?

00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:53.825
You're one cold-hearted jerk.

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:55.965
I've created my own monster.

00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:01.775
The one who ruined our lives...

00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:04.105
was you, wasn't it?

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:13.015
I'll get out over there.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:20.855
Min Ho, hold on!

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:24.865
Look, don't get the wrong idea.

00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:27.025
I'm telling you this for your own good.

00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:29.495
It's hard to make a living off volleyball.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:33.035
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

00:11:34.305 --> 00:11:35.305
Think it over carefully.

00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:37.575
Got it?

00:11:38.745 --> 00:11:39.745
I'll be on my way.

00:11:49.055 --> 00:11:54.055

(Park Min Ho)

00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:09.905
Son, have you eaten yet?

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:12.475
Yes, I ate.

00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:15.345
You sound down.

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.585
Is something wrong?

00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:19.745
No, it's just...

00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:23.315
I saw someone I know do something terrible, and...

00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:26.885
So you want to just let it slide,

00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:30.555
but it's weighing on your conscience.

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:32.925
Well...

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:36.865
Son, do what your heart tells you. Okay?

00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:39.835
If that's what you feel is right, then it is.

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:44.405
You know I'm always in your corner, right? Okay?

00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:48.845
Welcome.

00:12:50.115 --> 00:12:51.115
Hey, son.

00:12:52.515 --> 00:12:54.015
See you later.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.455
Okay. Oh, Dad!

00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:58.985
Thank you.

00:13:09.495 --> 00:13:10.495
Hey, Im Dong Hyeon.

00:13:12.135 --> 00:13:13.165
Where are you right now?

00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:19.345
Hey, Dong Hyeon, listen to me. If we don't fix this now,

00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:21.045
we'll be under his thumb forever.

00:13:24.075 --> 00:13:25.685
I'm going to the police today to report it.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.915
That you and Jo Seong Uk were match-fixing.

00:13:30.955 --> 00:13:32.725
What's it to you?

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:35.595
Dong Hyeon.

00:13:35.995 --> 00:13:37.295
Turn yourself in now, while you still can.

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:40.565
Look, if I go, I'm turning you in. But if you go, you turn yourself in.

00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:44.035
They'll definitely go easier on you. Okay?

00:13:45.035 --> 00:13:46.035
Dong Hyeon.

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:48.035
- Please. - You've got to be kidding me.

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:54.275
- Sit down. - Okay.

00:13:56.975 --> 00:13:59.015
What are you doing, you punk? Get over here.

(Jingwang University Volleyball Team Wins)

00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:15.495
I told you to think things over, but this...

00:14:16.395 --> 00:14:17.735
is very disappointing.

00:14:25.305 --> 00:14:26.905
You don't do that to people.

00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:30.745
What?

00:14:44.725 --> 00:14:45.725
Hey.

00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:48.865
- You hit him too. - What?

00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:50.895
If you just let him go,

00:14:51.935 --> 00:14:53.305
he's going to report all of you to the police.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.435
You're just going to let that happen?

00:15:00.545 --> 00:15:03.315
- Give it here. - No!

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:13.725
Hey.

00:15:18.595 --> 00:15:21.795
So what if you're the captain? Get lost, you jerk!

00:15:30.475 --> 00:15:32.675
He's acting weird.

00:15:36.675 --> 00:15:39.345
- Dong Hyeon, leave in five minutes. - Got it.

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:40.745
Seong Uk, you're with me.

00:16:18.925 --> 00:16:20.185
Oh, dear.

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:29.265
Yes. I found Min Ho.

00:16:32.705 --> 00:16:33.705
Min Ho.

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:36.105
Min Ho.

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:40.205
Are you dead?

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:44.545
He's dead, right?

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:49.015
What are you talking about?

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:51.855
Min Ho fought in the locker room and left.

00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:54.125
Right?

00:16:55.555 --> 00:16:59.295
- But Min Ho... - What is it?

00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:00.465
Are you calling the cops?

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:02.135
When you're the one who beat him up?

00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:06.835
Dong Hyeon! Listen carefully.

00:17:07.405 --> 00:17:09.575
Min Ho just fought with us and left. Min Ho just fought with us and left.

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:12.205
Got it? If this goes bad,

00:17:12.275 --> 00:17:15.175
say you fought in the locker room and that was it. Okay?

00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:21.085
- Answer me, you jerk! - Yes! Okay, I got it.

00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:27.025
From now on,

00:17:27.555 --> 00:17:29.495
I'll make sure you're all taken care of.

Dong Hyeon.

00:17:33.325 --> 00:17:34.465
Don't you worry about it.

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:36.395
I'll sort everything out.

00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:39.565
- Good job. Go get some rest. - Okay.

00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:40.635
Don't worry.

Lift his legs.

This jerk's eyes are still open.

Okay, lift! One, two, three.

One, two, three.

My grandma's been dead for ten years,

Are we really going to be okay?

00:19:13.725 --> 00:19:15.335
This is where you bury the dead.

00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:17.335
Yes, you're right.

00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:20.965
Grandma will be happy to have a new friend.

00:19:21.735 --> 00:19:22.735
Right?

00:19:25.345 --> 00:19:26.345
Let's bury him.

Darn it.

00:19:48.835 --> 00:19:50.965
- You're going to wear his shorts? - Right. The shorts.

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:02.315
Let's finish this quick and get something to eat.

00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:09.214
The defendant, Im Dong Hyeon,

00:20:09.215 --> 00:20:10.385

and 80 hours of community service.

What kind of justice is this?

00:20:20.325 --> 00:20:23.665
He killed a man, and he only gets five months?

00:20:24.835 --> 00:20:26.365

Tell me where my son is. Please, just tell me.

00:20:40.245 --> 00:20:43.615
He deserves a funeral, doesn't he?

00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:46.755
- I told you, I didn't kill him. - Just tell me!

00:20:47.185 --> 00:20:48.595
I said, tell me!

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.065
I'm not letting you get away with this.

00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:55.665

Hey, who knows how much we'll need tomorrow?

But listen.

- He knows what? - About Min Ho.

I suppose Min Ho will tell us everything now.

But there's one thing that's bothering me.

- What? - When Jo Seong Uk came here,

00:25:35.815 --> 00:25:37.175
he was on the phone with someone.

00:25:38.115 --> 00:25:41.245
He didn't hang up until after he removed the body from the grave.

00:25:41.785 --> 00:25:42.785
It was as if...

00:25:43.715 --> 00:25:45.285
he were asking for permission.

That's against the rules.

I told you to shake it after I catch the fish, you idiot.

00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:20.885
I'm sorry, it was my fault!

00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:24.055

- Let's do it! - No!

Help me!

00:27:43.805 --> 00:27:44.805
Seong Uk, come over here.

00:27:51.885 --> 00:27:53.445
Hey, what's all this about?

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:56.954
Suddenly, our game's rules broke.

00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:58.755
Then Min Ho sent a text,

00:27:58.825 --> 00:28:02.095
and now, someone else who knows everything has appeared.

00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:06.125
Dong Hyeon's always been terrible at explaining things.

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:08.695
I can't make heads or tails of what he's saying.

00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:10.195
Gwang Jin!

00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:12.765

00:28:17.575 --> 00:28:19.505
No, I'm telling you, the bobber moved.

00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:23.575
- That jerk is just lying. - No...

00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:26.885
Do you want to hear a secret?

00:28:28.015 --> 00:28:29.985
- What? - There are...

00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:33.425
no fish here.

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:54.775
Since Dong Hyeon is so bad at explaining things,

00:28:55.945 --> 00:28:59.185
why don't you explain it so I can understand?

00:29:05.225 --> 00:29:06.625
Why did you dig up Min Ho?

00:29:13.525 --> 00:29:16.565
According to the DNA results, the man missing for 15 years...

00:29:16.635 --> 00:29:17.935
was a match for Park Min Ho.

00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:22.435
And what did they determine was the cause of death?

00:29:22.905 --> 00:29:25.244
It is presumed that the death was caused by a skull fracture,

00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:27.305
but the direct cause is a traffic accident.

00:29:28.045 --> 00:29:29.215
A traffic accident?

00:29:29.475 --> 00:29:32.215
Yes. He had many compound fractures all over his body.

00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:37.255
The body will be transferred to the hospital morgue today.

00:29:37.955 --> 00:29:40.385
I'll call ahead so you can claim the body.

00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:42.725
Yes, thank you.

00:29:42.755 --> 00:29:46.125
(Violent Crimes Unit, Phishing Investigation Unit)

00:29:49.365 --> 00:29:50.935
A traffic accident?

00:30:21.765 --> 00:30:22.735
I took it.

00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:28.165
All right.

00:30:34.045 --> 00:30:36.315
Min Ho, it's been a while.

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:37.575
(Body Bag, Name: Park Min Ho)

00:30:37.875 --> 00:30:38.885
Take it.

00:30:43.485 --> 00:30:47.885
(Rainbow Taxi)

00:30:47.925 --> 00:30:48.955
Chief Park.

00:30:51.425 --> 00:30:55.435
(The Late Park Min Ho)

00:30:57.035 --> 00:30:58.035
Excuse me.

00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:01.365
There's been an accident.

00:31:02.235 --> 00:31:03.235
An accident?

00:31:03.805 --> 00:31:05.175
What are you talking about?

00:31:05.845 --> 00:31:07.545
What do you mean Park Min Ho's body was stolen?

00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:10.515
We were waiting for the body too.

00:31:10.775 --> 00:31:13.045
Apparently, they staged an accident and only took the body.

00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:17.255
But who on earth would do something like that?

00:31:22.425 --> 00:31:24.695
- Everyone. - What is it, Go Eun?

00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:31.995
This is the gym owned by Im Dong Hyeon.

00:31:32.205 --> 00:31:34.635
A fire broke out at a gym, and its owner, identified as Im,

00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:36.805
was found deceased at the scene.

00:31:37.035 --> 00:31:38.475
Im Dong Hyeon? Why all of a sudden?

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:39.875
There's more.

00:31:40.045 --> 00:31:41.974
They are investigating the cause of the fire.

00:31:41.975 --> 00:31:43.675
In other news, the volleyball coach investigated for match-fixing,

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:46.915
a scandal revealed by a confession from a Jingwang University player,

00:31:47.045 --> 00:31:50.155
Coach Jo was found drowned.

00:31:50.455 --> 00:31:52.055
Police suspect that Coach Jo may have...

00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:55.455
Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk. They were both definitely murdered.

00:31:55.795 --> 00:31:57.895
It can't be a coincidence that they died at the same time.

00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:01.125
And the theft of Park Min Ho's body...

00:32:02.535 --> 00:32:04.035
was all done by the same person.

00:32:04.695 --> 00:32:07.735
A perpetrator who's never even shown his face.

00:32:10.575 --> 00:32:11.575
But why?

00:32:14.105 --> 00:32:15.245
Mr. Park is in danger.

00:32:22.215 --> 00:32:24.785
Look who's still kicking, old man.

00:32:26.555 --> 00:32:27.555
Who are you?

00:32:27.955 --> 00:32:28.955
Me?

00:32:30.655 --> 00:32:32.525
I'm Park Min Ho.

00:32:35.935 --> 00:32:36.935
No, you're not.

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:41.135
Park Min Ho.

00:32:42.275 --> 00:32:44.735
Number ten on the Jingwang University volleyball team.

00:32:45.545 --> 00:32:46.575
Right-side hitter.

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:50.975
You've completely lost it, old man.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.585
He likes bibimbap with seasoned vegetables.

00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:56.915
There's no way you could've found Min Ho in your condition.

00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:04.355
Someone must be helping you.

00:33:05.195 --> 00:33:07.825
Right? Who is it?

00:33:08.725 --> 00:33:10.795
He likes Girls' Generation.

00:33:11.035 --> 00:33:12.365
Girls' Generation?

00:33:17.605 --> 00:33:19.875
He likes taking pictures.

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:28.585
You must be having a great time having a stroll.

00:33:32.885 --> 00:33:33.925
What's this?

00:33:35.425 --> 00:33:39.265
Dong Su! Who are you people? Move!

00:33:52.775 --> 00:33:53.775
Mr. Jang!

00:33:54.205 --> 00:33:55.205
So, it was you.

00:33:56.515 --> 00:33:57.674
You're the "Girls' Generation"...

00:33:57.675 --> 00:33:58.845
helping the old man from the shadows.

00:34:07.225 --> 00:34:08.895
Are you the one who took Park Min Ho's body?

00:34:12.765 --> 00:34:13.765
Dong Su!

00:34:27.345 --> 00:34:28.945
Sir, are you all right?

00:34:32.515 --> 00:34:34.245
You're fast.

00:34:35.685 --> 00:34:36.685
Answer my calls.

00:34:47.995 --> 00:34:50.035
That guy from before can really fight.

00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:52.305
Yes, he looks like he was in the special forces.

00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:06.345
Yes. Let's get our gear set up.

00:35:06.945 --> 00:35:08.215
Make it special.

00:35:14.455 --> 00:35:17.125
I smell big money.

00:35:38.415 --> 00:35:39.445
Cheon Gwang Jin.

00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:42.755
The grandson of the founding chairman of the Jingwang Foundation.

00:35:43.555 --> 00:35:46.425
The betting site Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk were using.

00:35:46.485 --> 00:35:49.855
The money trail from it led right back to Cheon Gwang Jin.

00:35:50.355 --> 00:35:52.965
Wait, the founding chairman?

00:35:53.165 --> 00:35:55.095
The grave Park Min Ho was in.

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:58.795
- That was the chairman's grave. - Wait, so what does that mean?

00:35:59.935 --> 00:36:02.635
He hid someone else's body in his own grandmother's grave?

00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:06.045
- Darn it. - This guy's a total psycho!

00:36:06.405 --> 00:36:09.244
Now it makes sense how Jo Seong Uk...

00:36:09.245 --> 00:36:11.275
coached Jingwang's volleyball team for so long.

00:36:11.375 --> 00:36:12.985
The worst part right now...

00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:16.455
is that they have Park Min Ho's body.

00:36:16.685 --> 00:36:19.754
Okay, but why would they steal Park Min Ho's body?

00:36:19.755 --> 00:36:21.355
I just don't get it.

00:36:21.685 --> 00:36:23.825
Because Park Min Ho's body is all that's left.

00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:30.335
Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk, who shared the secret, are dead,

00:36:31.265 --> 00:36:32.905
and there's no evidence left.

00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:35.035
If they get rid of Park Min Ho's body,

00:36:36.335 --> 00:36:38.475
the truth of what happened that day will be buried forever.

00:36:39.045 --> 00:36:40.505
If that happens,

00:36:41.145 --> 00:36:44.945
it means we can never solve Mr. Park Dong Su's case.

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:52.955
That's why...

00:36:55.525 --> 00:36:57.155
we have to go right now.

00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:14.045
(Jackpot Daycare)

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:19.185
For a second there, I was worried you would go alone, Driver Kim.

00:37:19.685 --> 00:37:23.385
Cheon Gwang Jin. He thinks without restraint and is dangerous.

00:37:24.355 --> 00:37:26.325
I might not be able to handle him on my own.

00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:27.825
We have to go together.

00:37:28.185 --> 00:37:31.955
Of course. It'll be hard for you to face a psycho like that alone.

00:37:32.155 --> 00:37:35.295
Right. We'll fight like psychos right alongside you, Driver Kim.

00:37:35.465 --> 00:37:38.295
- We don't have to be psychos too. - You think so?

00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:48.405
Hey, Girls' Generation.

00:37:49.045 --> 00:37:50.675
I don't recall introducing myself that way.

00:37:51.145 --> 00:37:53.285
How much did that senile old geezer pay you?

00:37:54.215 --> 00:37:56.485
I can pay you way more.

00:37:56.885 --> 00:37:58.615
Talking about money over the phone doesn't feel right.

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.085
How about we talk in person?

00:38:00.155 --> 00:38:04.095
Gosh, great minds think alike.

00:38:04.995 --> 00:38:06.425
Glad to hear we're on the same page.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:09.095
I'll text you the address. Get here within the hour.

00:38:11.035 --> 00:38:12.965
Be late, and you'll never find Min Ho's bones.

00:38:14.265 --> 00:38:16.605
Goodness. He's already hooked.

00:38:20.475 --> 00:38:21.774

(Donated by Chairman Baek and Cheon Gwang Jin)

00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:34.554
I have a bad feeling about this place...

00:38:34.555 --> 00:38:36.154
just from looking at the map.

00:38:36.155 --> 00:38:37.855
Why? Where on earth is it?

00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:40.625
A forgotten place.

00:38:41.025 --> 00:38:42.125
A forgotten place?

00:38:57.915 --> 00:38:59.445
What's he doing?

00:38:59.745 --> 00:39:01.945
They're not coming to get him, and not telling him to go in.

00:39:02.615 --> 00:39:04.385
I think they're checking to see if I came alone.

00:39:09.925 --> 00:39:11.695
He has no tail.

00:39:11.795 --> 00:39:13.765
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:39:42.725 --> 00:39:44.425
There's a school out here?

00:40:34.045 --> 00:40:36.545
So? You like this place?

00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:42.855
Isn't it rude to invite someone over and then just call him?

00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:44.585
Look to your right.

00:40:48.525 --> 00:40:51.295
See that door with the X on it? Come in through there.

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:09.045
So?

00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.875
This school's got a killer vibe, doesn't it?

00:41:12.915 --> 00:41:15.415
When I was in elementary school, I was playing with a friend,

00:41:15.955 --> 00:41:17.585
and I accidentally killed him.

00:41:18.815 --> 00:41:20.525
But my family...

00:41:21.155 --> 00:41:24.555
thought it was an accident, so they covered it all up for me.

00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:29.495
But my grandma caught on.

00:41:30.765 --> 00:41:32.295
That it wasn't an accident.

00:41:32.735 --> 00:41:35.905
Even thinking about it now, it's creepy, don't you think?

00:41:37.135 --> 00:41:38.775
How did my grandma even figure it out?

00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:43.915
So she rushed to build this school.

00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:47.785
She planned to lock me up here after I graduated from elementary school.

00:41:49.085 --> 00:41:51.055
That's why this school is just like you.

00:41:52.015 --> 00:41:54.625
It's crawling with nothing but scum.

00:41:56.825 --> 00:41:59.565
I'm not the scum, my grandma is.

00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:02.565
A grown-up shouldn't treat her own grandson like that.

00:42:02.935 --> 00:42:04.565
But you know what's even creepier?

00:42:06.035 --> 00:42:10.035
I went and figured out her little plan.

00:42:13.675 --> 00:42:17.045
Gosh. You should have just let the past stay buried.

00:42:17.145 --> 00:42:20.315
Why on earth are you digging it all up now? Such a pain.

00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:25.585
Park Min Ho's body. Where is it now?

00:42:25.755 --> 00:42:28.025
Right. I almost forgot that's why you're here.

00:42:30.795 --> 00:42:32.425
Let's see.

00:42:33.365 --> 00:42:37.135
There's an item under the statue to your right.

00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:46.245
(Title: "Grandmother and Grandson")

00:43:05.455 --> 00:43:06.995
What is this now?

00:43:07.525 --> 00:43:09.065
Let's play a game with that.

00:43:09.765 --> 00:43:10.865
A survival game.

00:43:12.035 --> 00:43:14.935
If you win, Min Ho's bones are yours.

00:43:16.175 --> 00:43:17.305
If I win,

00:43:18.275 --> 00:43:19.905
I'll just throw them away.

00:43:51.405 --> 00:43:54.175
All right.

00:43:54.675 --> 00:43:55.805
Start!

00:44:01.145 --> 00:44:02.815
Round One.

00:44:03.585 --> 00:44:04.585
Fight.

00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:37.885
Gosh, look at that jerk using the terrain to his advantage.

00:44:40.355 --> 00:44:43.155
Goodness, the odds are skyrocketing.

00:44:44.155 --> 00:44:46.395
See? This is why the fighting dog has to be tough.

00:44:52.635 --> 00:44:53.705
Go Eun.

00:44:54.565 --> 00:44:56.575
Can you check the building's CCTV footage?

00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:00.605
It won't take long.

00:45:03.515 --> 00:45:05.715
Chief Choi, Chief Park, how much longer will you be in there?

00:45:05.975 --> 00:45:08.215
I need you to get me into the school's intranet now.

00:45:10.155 --> 00:45:11.655
- Hold on. - What? Why?

00:45:12.215 --> 00:45:14.355
Aren't we going too fast? What if there are guys out there?

00:45:14.425 --> 00:45:16.595
Go Eun said she needs us to connect her right away.

00:45:16.955 --> 00:45:19.225
- All right, fine. - I'm going out.

00:45:19.965 --> 00:45:21.095
Hey, wait.

00:45:21.365 --> 00:45:22.595
What is it now?

00:45:23.165 --> 00:45:24.565
I think I just heard footsteps outside.

00:45:24.935 --> 00:45:28.405
- What? I don't hear anything. - You don't?

00:45:29.265 --> 00:45:32.104
Fine, whatever. I'm going out on three. One.

00:45:32.105 --> 00:45:34.144
- Why are you in such a rush? - Two.

00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:35.375
What if those jerks are outside?

00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:41.185
Hey, you jerks!

00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:42.985
Three.

00:45:43.885 --> 00:45:44.985
- Let's move. - Okay.

00:45:45.055 --> 00:45:46.055
Go Eun's waiting.

00:46:37.675 --> 00:46:40.475
Hey, take it easy. These jerks are trashing it all.

00:46:42.945 --> 00:46:44.275
The payout's good, though.

00:46:51.655 --> 00:46:52.755
Get him!

00:46:53.785 --> 00:46:56.295
- Hey! - Open the door!

00:46:58.895 --> 00:47:00.225
Darn it.

00:47:07.035 --> 00:47:08.465
Round Two.

00:47:09.335 --> 00:47:10.335
Fight.

00:47:12.305 --> 00:47:13.405
There's more?

00:47:17.445 --> 00:47:18.475
Just a second.

00:47:25.985 --> 00:47:26.985
Okay.

00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:34.325
Go Eun, we're connected.

00:47:34.865 --> 00:47:36.225
- Jin Eon. - Yes?

00:47:53.645 --> 00:47:55.645
So they're even using an external internet connection.

00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:04.025
What is this?

00:48:06.495 --> 00:48:07.595
You jerk!

00:48:12.765 --> 00:48:13.805
You jerk!

00:48:16.135 --> 00:48:18.135
Driver Kim Do Gi, you are...

00:48:19.275 --> 00:48:21.705
being broadcast on the dark web internationally.

00:48:28.915 --> 00:48:31.915
There's a betting ring on you. These people are completely insane.

00:48:55.245 --> 00:48:57.575
Look at his defense.

00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:11.395
Go Eun, can you find the broadcasting room?

00:49:11.555 --> 00:49:15.795
- The broadcasting room? - Cheon Gwang Jin rang the bell.

00:49:16.065 --> 00:49:17.265
Showing you the way now.

00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:31.015
He's an entertaining one.

00:49:32.475 --> 00:49:34.045
- Patch into the hallway feed. - Yes, sir.

00:49:40.825 --> 00:49:41.825
The broadcasting room...

00:49:41.826 --> 00:49:43.455
is the last room on the floor directly above you.

00:49:48.895 --> 00:49:51.595
What? Why did it turn off? Next hallway.

00:49:57.575 --> 00:50:00.245
Darn it, can't you do a job properly, you jerk?

00:50:00.305 --> 00:50:01.705
It wasn't me.

00:50:01.845 --> 00:50:04.115
- I think someone else has control. - What?

00:50:04.145 --> 00:50:05.215
Directional controls aren't responding.

00:50:05.675 --> 00:50:07.515
Of course they're not.

00:50:09.115 --> 00:50:10.215
Darn it.

00:50:12.755 --> 00:50:15.124
- Got you! - Hey, people are leaving!

00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:16.955
Darn it. My money!

00:50:17.025 --> 00:50:18.055
The feed's down again.

00:50:18.295 --> 00:50:19.355
Darn it!

00:50:22.465 --> 00:50:23.895
Can't see a thing, can you?

00:50:25.995 --> 00:50:28.565
This is an interesting situation, isn't it?

00:50:31.475 --> 00:50:34.645
Why isn't this working? Get it back online, now!

00:50:34.905 --> 00:50:36.205
You're asking why?

00:50:36.845 --> 00:50:37.975
Darn it.

00:50:42.115 --> 00:50:43.615
Hey, what are you waiting for?

00:50:43.955 --> 00:50:45.085
Go check it out now!

00:50:58.495 --> 00:51:00.035
Round Three.

00:51:00.965 --> 00:51:02.035
Fight!

00:51:23.295 --> 00:51:25.695
You're surprisingly good at this.

00:51:26.925 --> 00:51:29.125
How would you like to make some real money with me?

00:51:43.575 --> 00:51:46.915
They must think anyone who shows up on screen is a player.

00:51:47.545 --> 00:51:49.645
It looks like everyone's hoping you die.

00:51:51.055 --> 00:51:54.155
- I guess that's where the money is. - It is for me.

00:51:55.985 --> 00:51:57.725
Because you're the one who's going to die here.

00:51:59.495 --> 00:52:01.795
There are some killer bets placed against you.

00:52:18.375 --> 00:52:20.245
(Jingwang Boys' Middle School)

00:52:21.645 --> 00:52:24.115
(Disciplinary spanking)

00:52:24.455 --> 00:52:26.155
I can't believe they still have these in schools.

00:52:31.325 --> 00:52:32.395
Disciplinary spanking.

00:52:43.035 --> 00:52:44.035
Does it hurt?

00:52:46.435 --> 00:52:48.045
You should have...

00:52:50.675 --> 00:52:52.015
listened to your teacher.

00:53:05.825 --> 00:53:06.825
Goodness.

00:53:07.165 --> 00:53:08.925
So you beat all the minions and made it to the final boss.

00:53:35.085 --> 00:53:36.355
You're too slow.

00:54:20.265 --> 00:54:21.365
So are you.

00:54:36.045 --> 00:54:37.685
I guess that's the one thing we have in common.

00:55:18.395 --> 00:55:20.565
You're here for Park Min Ho's body, right?

00:55:21.925 --> 00:55:23.635
I'll tell you where it is.

00:55:24.865 --> 00:55:26.465
Thanks, but I'll pass.

00:55:27.135 --> 00:55:28.335
Because I've already found him.

00:55:40.445 --> 00:55:42.115
Park Min Ho has been safely recovered.

00:55:45.715 --> 00:55:48.585
Hey, how much did that old man pay you?

00:55:50.655 --> 00:55:51.795
I'll give you...

00:55:53.055 --> 00:55:55.465
ten times that amount. Okay?

00:56:00.035 --> 00:56:01.135
No?

00:56:02.165 --> 00:56:03.335
How about 20 times?

00:56:06.505 --> 00:56:07.845
I'll pass on that too.

00:56:09.045 --> 00:56:11.175
Then just die.

00:56:27.265 --> 00:56:29.465
I just eyeballed it, but luckily, it's a perfect fit.

00:56:36.035 --> 00:56:37.135
Oh, gosh.

00:56:38.505 --> 00:56:39.905
It hurts.

00:56:41.045 --> 00:56:43.345
I think everything's broken.

00:56:46.845 --> 00:56:47.845
You know what?

00:56:48.485 --> 00:56:50.415
They say falling from three stories up...

00:56:50.985 --> 00:56:54.385
is like getting hit by a car going 60km per hour.

00:56:57.155 --> 00:56:58.325
It hurts.

00:57:01.225 --> 00:57:03.635
I need to go to a hospital.

00:57:05.535 --> 00:57:07.565
That's how Park Min Ho must've felt when you hit him with your car.

00:57:08.635 --> 00:57:10.675
And his father, Park Dong Su, must have too.

00:57:15.275 --> 00:57:16.575
What did you do back then?

00:57:19.275 --> 00:57:20.645
Did you just stand there and watch?

00:57:25.185 --> 00:57:26.455
Smiling just like this?

00:57:32.495 --> 00:57:33.695
Please spare me.

00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:39.365
Please spare me.

00:57:40.265 --> 00:57:43.005
I'll never do it again.

00:57:46.175 --> 00:57:48.575
Why? Are you scared?

00:57:49.605 --> 00:57:51.145
That you'll disappear without a trace?

00:57:54.445 --> 00:57:57.415
Come on, you know how I feel.

00:57:57.985 --> 00:58:00.425
You're not a bad guy, are you?

00:58:12.995 --> 00:58:14.735
So you are a bad guy.

00:58:28.615 --> 00:58:30.245
Then just kill me already.

00:58:32.715 --> 00:58:34.985
You're going to kill me anyway.

00:58:48.205 --> 00:58:51.175
Park Min Ho, the man you killed. His father resets this every time.

00:58:51.775 --> 00:58:52.905
Three minutes.

00:58:53.845 --> 00:58:57.575
All the time he had left to remember his son.

00:59:03.615 --> 00:59:06.155
Before this sand runs out, you'd better think hard.

00:59:07.225 --> 00:59:09.355
Is there even a single person in this world...

00:59:10.025 --> 00:59:11.525
who will genuinely remember you?

00:59:33.315 --> 00:59:34.315
Is there?

00:59:45.995 --> 00:59:47.425
Yes, there is!

00:59:48.665 --> 00:59:49.865
You!

00:59:51.995 --> 00:59:55.535
You'll have to be the one to remember me!

01:00:08.245 --> 01:00:09.745
(My moments of lucidity are getting shorter.)

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.055
(And they last under 3 minutes.)

01:00:11.115 --> 01:00:12.885
(I'm leaving the things I must remember and never forget.)

01:00:15.055 --> 01:00:16.525
You!

01:00:18.295 --> 01:00:21.565
You'll have to be the one to remember me!

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.255
Min Ho!

01:00:54.565 --> 01:00:55.995
Min Ho!

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:59.795
Dad, hurry up. The sun's just starting to set.

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:04.675
When I was coming up here,

01:01:05.105 --> 01:01:06.705
I didn't think you'd actually be here.

01:01:06.775 --> 01:01:09.475
Of course I'm here. We made a promise, Dad.

01:01:10.245 --> 01:01:11.375
We...

01:01:11.615 --> 01:01:13.475
promised to return here together, remember?

01:01:13.885 --> 01:01:16.745
- Yes. - The sky is beautiful today too.

01:01:16.785 --> 01:01:17.815
Right.

01:01:19.015 --> 01:01:21.155
I knew you'd find me, Dad.

01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:27.495
I'm sorry. It took me so long, didn't it?

01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:28.795
No, it's okay.

01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:33.665
Dad.

01:01:34.565 --> 01:01:36.835
You went through so much trying to find me.

01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:39.605
You really did.

01:01:44.215 --> 01:01:45.275
Dad.

01:01:46.175 --> 01:01:48.545
I'll go on ahead and wait for you,

01:01:49.445 --> 01:01:50.885
so you take your time...

01:01:51.515 --> 01:01:53.155
and come join me much later.

01:01:53.855 --> 01:01:54.885
Okay?

01:01:57.395 --> 01:01:58.855
And don't you worry about me.

01:01:59.555 --> 01:02:00.665
Min Ho.

01:02:04.735 --> 01:02:05.735
Thank you.

01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:58.784
(Dong Su, please give me a call. Seong Cheol)

01:02:58.785 --> 01:03:00.085
Dong Su.

01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:01.755
Please give me a call.

01:03:10.465 --> 01:03:11.465
Dong Su.

01:03:13.565 --> 01:03:17.105
I've been waiting for this phone to ring.

01:03:19.105 --> 01:03:21.645
Your son Min Ho is on his final journey.

01:03:22.905 --> 01:03:24.775
You have to be the one to see him off.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.784
(Deluxe Taxi)

01:03:31.785 --> 01:03:33.255
Thank you.

01:03:33.815 --> 01:03:35.555
Thank you so much.

01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:49.735
(The late Park Min Ho)

01:04:15.725 --> 01:04:18.035
(The late Park Min Ho)

01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:26.235
Min Ho.

01:04:27.645 --> 01:04:28.705
Yes?

01:04:29.005 --> 01:04:30.575
The sky is so beautiful.

01:04:31.915 --> 01:04:33.615
It's the kind of sky you love.

01:04:36.015 --> 01:04:37.045
Look at that.

01:04:38.955 --> 01:04:40.015
It is.

01:04:40.825 --> 01:04:42.425
It's really beautiful today too.

01:04:56.135 --> 01:04:58.135
(The late Park Min Ho)

01:06:56.325 --> 01:06:58.225
(Special thanks to our guest star, Um Mun Suk)

(Taxi Driver 3)

01:07:13.705 --> 01:07:16.945
You know, my dream was to be an idol.

01:07:17.345 --> 01:07:21.185
I'm going all-in on you, risking everything I have.

01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:22.345
Where are we going?

01:07:22.585 --> 01:07:25.515
The next thing she knew, she woke up somewhere strange.

01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:28.355
Then what am I supposed to do?

01:07:28.855 --> 01:07:30.655
If you can't debut now, the group is done.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.625
I really don't know anything.

01:07:32.955 --> 01:07:35.495
Just remember how badly you wanted this.

01:07:35.695 --> 01:07:38.895
What if the agency is the one that's been threatening our client?

01:07:39.165 --> 01:07:40.335
You're in for a beating today.

01:07:41.005 --> 01:07:42.835
Looks like we'll need someone on the inside.

01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:44.475
We'll replace the manager.
