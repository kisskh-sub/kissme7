00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.454
Li Jen-yao.

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:21.751
Don't worry. We're here to help you.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.380
Tell us how you got these injuries.

00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:29.843
How dare you do it.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.304
Fuck!

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:41.521
Jen-yao! Listen to me!

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:43.982
No!

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:45.733
Go inside!

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:50.488
Li Jen-yao, stop wasting time.

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:52.031
Just tell the school counselor.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:55.201
Did the injuries on your face
come from classmates,

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:57.328
or did you get into trouble
outside of school?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.310
If your dad doesn't show up again
next week,

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.645
we'll come back.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.439
When that happens,

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:26.733
we won't be so courteous.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:28.568
Got it?

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:45.710
You're back.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:04.687
What are you looking at? Huh?

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:05.897
What are you looking at?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.982
He did nothing.
Don't throw drunken tantrums.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.442
Jen-yao, go study--

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:11.694
Get lost!
What the hell are you looking at?

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:12.612
No!

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:16.366
-What are you looking at?
-Don't do this!

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.534
No! Don't do this!

00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:19.994
Fuck you! Fuck!

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:25.917
Fuck!

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.217
I fell off a motorbike and got hurt.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.719
What? You fell off a motorbike?

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:39.681
Yes.

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:43.977
I didn't tell you earlier
because I don't have a driver's license,

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:47.230
so I was afraid I'd get a demerit
or be punished.

00:02:55.488 --> 00:02:56.698
Is that good enough?

00:02:57.323 --> 00:02:58.616
Can I go back to class now?

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.538
Li Jen-yao,

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:08.751
please trust that
we'll always stand by our students.

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:10.878
So whatever happens in the future,

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.172
you can come to me if you need help.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.602
I want to get spicy hot pot.

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:28.229
How is that sweet?

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:29.397
Let's get cake.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.024
Hot pot causes acne.

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:34.152
-Let's get spicy hot pot.
-Yeah.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:35.361
I want to get youtiao too.

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:37.530
-I'm going upstairs. Bye!
-Bye!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.214
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:08.384
This is for you.

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:09.677
Take it.

00:08:10.636 --> 00:08:12.597
Your stomach growled from hunger.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.639
Just eat it.

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:23.524
Why don't you eat?

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:27.612
I'm in the dance class.

00:08:29.113 --> 00:08:33.492
All of us have to watch our weight
so that we're ready for the performance.

00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:36.495
But I think I'm getting too heavy.

00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:39.123
Yet my mom still prepares
big lunches for me.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.418
But you don't look very heavy.

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:44.920
Of course I don't.

00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:47.840
I didn't say I'm too heavy,
just that I'm getting there.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.385
Hey.

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:54.347
Just take it as me wanting to lose weight,
but not waste food.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.848
Finish my lunch for me.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.695
Damn it. It's a chicken drumstick.

00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:16.702
What? Hurry up and eat.

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:45.564
You look even hungrier than me.
Why did you give me your lunch?

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.275
I can't eat more.

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:51.112
Also, sneaking off to buy lunch like this
is against school rules.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.031
Not if I don't get caught.

00:09:57.535 --> 00:09:58.661
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:00.996
-One pork ribs bento.
-One pork ribs bento, okay.

00:10:01.747 --> 00:10:03.624
Hey, I don't want pork ribs.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.376
I want a drumstick.

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.092
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:15.052
-A drumstick instead.
-No problem.

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:24.687
Thank you.

00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:28.858
It's the military instructor. Let's go.

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:41.996
Why haven't you finished your lunch?
You're a slow eater.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.332
That's because you ate fast.

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:47.918
You said you wanted to lose weight,

00:10:48.002 --> 00:10:50.629
but you finished a drumstick bento
in minutes.

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:54.467
What should I do?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.719
Only three days after going on a diet

00:10:56.802 --> 00:10:59.054
and I ate a whole bento.

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:01.640
Oh no!

00:11:01.724 --> 00:11:04.059
I'm going to fail tomorrow's weight check.

00:11:08.439 --> 00:11:11.108
You can't say a word
about what happened just now.

00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:15.321
Do you mean failing to lose weight

00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:17.698
or scarfing down a drumstick bento
in three minutes?

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:19.617
Both! Say a word and you're dead.

00:11:26.624 --> 00:11:29.585
I have dance practice this afternoon.
Gotta head back to class.

00:11:40.513 --> 00:11:41.597
Bye-bye.

00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:57.446
Li Jen-yao.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.325
Okay, I got it.

00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:05.579
My name is Chiang Hsiao-tung.
You'll be here at noon tomorrow, right?

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.710
Then I'll give you my lunch tomorrow too.

00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.045
Bye-bye.

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:25.182
OCEAN DRAGON SEAFOOD

00:12:58.716 --> 00:13:00.676
Only three days after going on a diet

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:02.720
and I ate a whole bento.

00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:04.889
Oh no!

00:13:09.643 --> 00:13:10.853
Jen-yao.

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:12.688
Are you okay?

00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:14.356
Why the smile?

00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:16.650
Nothing.

00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:18.527
Are the customers done? I'll clean up.

00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:20.195
Hey, here.

00:13:21.822 --> 00:13:24.199
Here. Your salary for the month.

00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:26.243
You've worked quite hard this month.

00:13:26.744 --> 00:13:28.579
Here's 2,000 dollars extra.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.664
Take it.

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:32.750
Thank you.

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:46.513
YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:50.601
I waited ages for you. Let's go.

00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:53.354
Don't be afraid.

00:13:53.437 --> 00:13:55.064
Let's go.

00:13:55.147 --> 00:13:56.148
Get in.

00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.316
Kiddo.

00:13:58.067 --> 00:13:59.276
Off work, huh?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.778
Are you going home?

00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:02.237
We'll give you a ride

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:04.907
so we can say hi to your dad.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.326
He hasn't been home for ages.

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.162
I don't know where he is.
I don't want to know.

00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:12.748
Don't come to me again.

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:22.549
If your dad hasn't been home,

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:25.719
how did you get this wound on your face?

00:14:29.264 --> 00:14:32.643
You're really unlucky
to have such a savage father.

00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:38.607
What?

00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:41.276
Hurts too much to breathe?

00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:45.948
My boss used to hit me like that
when I didn't collect all the debts.

00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:49.201
Don't be scared.
You'll be fine in a few minutes.

00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:55.624
What are you doing?

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:00.713
I'll be straight with you.

00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:03.674
Man, I've been collecting debts
for over a decade.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.468
I've seen a lot of savages like your dad.

00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:08.637
With a dad like that,

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:10.889
it doesn't matter how hard you work.

00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:14.560
You'll never amount to anything.

00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:25.529
The money from today

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.323
will cover your dad's interest
for the week.

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:31.618
If your dad doesn't show up next week,

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.288
I guess we won't bother.

00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:37.624
I'll just come to you from then on.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:39.168
Kiddo!

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:42.671
What do you think?

00:16:07.362 --> 00:16:09.531
Mom, don't say anything. Come with me.

00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:13.077
Jen-yao.

00:16:13.702 --> 00:16:15.913
Jen-yao, what's wrong? What's…

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:29.343
-Hey, you guys--
-Mom, calm down.

00:16:33.347 --> 00:16:35.265
What the hell? Fuck you!

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:38.936
Are you gonna pay up?

00:16:40.312 --> 00:16:41.438
Listen to me.

00:16:42.022 --> 00:16:44.775
No, don't do this.

00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:45.901
Mom!

00:16:46.693 --> 00:16:47.820
Forget him already.

00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:49.947
What do you mean, "forget him"?
He's your dad!

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.741
Mom.

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:54.660
Let go of me, Li Jen-yao!

00:16:54.743 --> 00:16:55.744
Wake up!

00:16:57.454 --> 00:16:59.289
Do you know how he treats us?

00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.084
He doesn't deserve to be my dad.

00:17:03.043 --> 00:17:04.837
He's the one who's deep in debt.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.964
Why should we suffer?
Have you thought about that?

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:10.092
Go ahead, keep hiding.

00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:13.137
Hand over the money.

00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:16.890
Don't worry, okay?

00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:20.102
I've talked to them.

00:17:20.185 --> 00:17:23.355
They'll go to him for money from now on
and leave us alone.

00:17:24.815 --> 00:17:25.649
Mom,

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:27.985
we're finally rid of him.

00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:31.905
So

00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:35.784
you're the one who handed him over?

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.253
He asked for it.

00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:00.851
He is your dad!

00:18:03.812 --> 00:18:07.983
He's your dad, no matter what!

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:57.527
Chicken heart, got it.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.155
-And two corn on the cobs, okay.
-Zucchinis are good.

00:21:00.238 --> 00:21:01.823
-Try them. They're good.
-That's right.

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:03.367
Then some zucchinis, please.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.369
Sure. Zucchinis are healthy.

00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:09.456
-And some green bell peppers.
-Good order. Green bell peppers are great.

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:14.503
Stop fooling around. Give it to me.

00:21:14.586 --> 00:21:16.213
-Customers are waiting.
-Fine.

00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:17.381
My bad.

00:21:17.464 --> 00:21:18.715
I'm sorry.

00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:23.595
Our roasted chicken hearts are good.

00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:24.846
-Want some?
-Sure.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.391
Sorry for the wait.
That'll be 100 dollars.

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:29.017
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:21:29.518 --> 00:21:30.394
Come again. Bye.

00:21:30.477 --> 00:21:31.895
You ordered non-spicy, right?

00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:34.398
-Yes, non-spicy.
-Okay, non-spicy.

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:12.370
Looks like I can consider you
for the solo at the end-of-semester show.

00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:22.422
But you must continue
maintaining this state.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.549
Let's take ten.

00:23:29.638 --> 00:23:32.015
Hsiao-tung, I told you. You can do it.

00:23:32.098 --> 00:23:34.267
Yeah, I was so happy for you just now.

00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:35.810
You're reading too much into it.

00:23:35.894 --> 00:23:37.145
It's too soon to celebrate.

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:39.856
The teacher said she'd consider it.
Nothing's decided yet.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.858
Who else could it be but you?

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:45.028
That's right. If it's being considered,
it's as good as certain.

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:46.571
Of course not.

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:02.254
Give me a second.

00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:40.584
Li Jen-yao.

00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:38.475
Go away!

00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:45.065
Fuck! Are you nuts?

00:25:45.148 --> 00:25:47.525
What did I do?
Why are you doing this to me?

00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:54.407
You forgot already?

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.578
What are you talking about?

00:25:59.704 --> 00:26:00.997
Please let me go.

00:26:01.081 --> 00:26:01.915
I will never--

00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:32.070
2023

00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:35.532
Where's Yu? Did she take the day off?

00:26:35.615 --> 00:26:37.617
I don't know. She didn't say a word.

00:26:38.118 --> 00:26:41.621
She didn't text back in the group chat
or answer her phone.

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:44.124
Damn it. What's up with her?

00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:09.482
Miss, are you okay?

00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:28.126
Pin-yu.

00:27:29.711 --> 00:27:31.755
Are you okay? What happened?

00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:36.092
Are you a family member of Miss Chou?

00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:37.761
Yes, I am.

00:27:37.844 --> 00:27:40.764
We received a report
about her standing by the platform,

00:27:40.847 --> 00:27:41.931
looking disoriented.

00:27:42.724 --> 00:27:45.393
We did notice
she was a bit mentally unstable,

00:27:45.477 --> 00:27:49.355
so we called her family
to pick her up just to be safe.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.161
You hung up on me
when we were on the phone yesterday.

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:07.916
I called again, but you didn't answer,
so I went to your place to look for you.

00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:12.170
The building manager said
he saw you leave in a daze.

00:28:12.837 --> 00:28:14.214
What's wrong with you?

00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:23.807
If I said

00:28:24.808 --> 00:28:27.602
I was possessed by a ghost,
would you believe me?

00:28:30.688 --> 00:28:32.190
Possessed by a ghost?

00:28:40.698 --> 00:28:43.660
I don't even remember
why I went to the platform.

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:46.996
I only remember

00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:49.499
being in the middle of our call.

00:28:49.582 --> 00:28:51.167
Hey, sis.

00:28:51.251 --> 00:28:52.126
Listen.

00:28:52.627 --> 00:28:55.004
I think I saw that girl again tonight.

00:29:06.724 --> 00:29:07.725
Are you looking for me?

00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:12.832
Welcome to Rising Radio.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:15.043
You're listening to
New Life with Classical.

00:30:15.126 --> 00:30:17.921
Let classical music enter your life.

00:30:20.673 --> 00:30:23.760
I may not be able to see the world clearly
with my eyes.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.430
But that doesn't mean
I can't hear the beauty of the world.

00:30:27.931 --> 00:30:29.515
Welcome.

00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:32.894
Let me connect with you
through music and my voice.

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.071
Good evening, friends.

00:30:43.154 --> 00:30:46.449
The first piece
I'd like to introduce to you today is

00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:48.242
"Clair de lune" by Debussy.

00:30:48.326 --> 00:30:51.412
This is also
one of my favorite classical pieces.

00:30:51.496 --> 00:30:55.249
Later, I'll explain
the origin of this piece

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:57.543
and why I like it.

00:30:59.212 --> 00:31:01.297
We all know that

00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:05.802
there aren't many things in life
that truly make us happy.

00:31:05.885 --> 00:31:08.262
We also tend to look on the bright side,

00:31:08.346 --> 00:31:11.349
to guard that rarely found happiness,

00:31:11.432 --> 00:31:13.059
to keep it in mind.

00:31:13.935 --> 00:31:17.146
Recently, I encountered something
which made me realize

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:21.401
we feel unhappy most of the time,
maybe because…

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:52.140
Why are you here?

00:32:04.235 --> 00:32:06.446
Which part of the footage
would you like to start with?

00:32:07.572 --> 00:32:10.408
Sometime after half past ten yesterday.

00:32:14.662 --> 00:32:15.663
That's it.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:21.294
Were you crying?

00:32:25.923 --> 00:32:27.300
That wasn't me.

00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:29.802
It was her.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:56.287
TAIWAN'S CRUELEST SERIAL KILLER
OF ALL TIME

00:33:03.461 --> 00:33:05.588
MOTHER OF OUYANG TI
FIRST TO DISCOVER CRIME SCENE

00:33:13.429 --> 00:33:14.639
LI JEN-YAO

00:33:14.722 --> 00:33:16.641
LI JEN-YAO
DEATH PENALTY, RAINSTORM KILLER

00:33:17.141 --> 00:33:18.768
Why did she look up Li Jen-yao?

00:33:20.311 --> 00:33:22.230
What's their relationship?

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.776
If she didn't possess my body
to make me kill myself,

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.821
then what did she want?

00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:32.031
She wanted to go somewhere.

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:35.034
She wanted to find him.

00:33:35.618 --> 00:33:36.452
Pin-yu.

00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:39.497
Why did she want to find him?
She didn't show up in my research.

00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:42.542
But Li Jen-yao killed so many people.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:44.961
Are there still victims
who haven't been found?

00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:47.922
-Pin-yu.
-So…

00:33:49.006 --> 00:33:51.050
She wanted to take revenge on him
through me.

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:52.051
Chou Pin-yu.

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:57.765
It's okay.
Why don't you take a break first?

00:33:58.516 --> 00:33:59.767
You're tired, aren't you?

00:34:00.268 --> 00:34:03.396
Have you thought
that the overwhelming mental stress

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.815
from dealing with
a cruel murderer at work,

00:34:06.524 --> 00:34:07.984
your recent move,

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:10.069
and the scary rumors you heard

00:34:10.153 --> 00:34:12.697
might be causing hallucinations?

00:34:13.197 --> 00:34:14.657
This is not good for you.

00:34:15.324 --> 00:34:16.742
Move back in with me first.

00:34:19.245 --> 00:34:21.539
I told you, they weren't hallucinations.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.667
I've never sleepwalked.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.210
I know that wasn't me.

00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:38.306
-Ta-wei.
-Hey, Chou Pin-yu, you're still sleeping?

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.725
Did you forget about the interview today?

00:34:40.808 --> 00:34:43.603
You ignored my calls and messages.
What were you doing?

00:34:43.686 --> 00:34:46.105
Sorry. Something came up today.

00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:47.523
I'll get there right away.

00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:49.066
All right. Be quick.

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:52.612
I forgot I had work today.

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:53.988
I'm going to change.

00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:06.250
Sis.

00:35:13.925 --> 00:35:15.426
Thank you for coming to get me.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:18.387
I made you worry again.

00:35:19.138 --> 00:35:19.972
I'm sorry.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.267
It's all right.

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:26.187
Go get changed and head to work first.

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:41.118
If you analyze these murders based on
when Li Jen-yao committed them

00:35:41.202 --> 00:35:45.748
rather than when the bodies were found,

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.417
you will notice

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:51.921
the first murder was more like
an impulsive crime.

00:35:53.047 --> 00:35:55.466
The scene showed signs
of a rushed cleanup.

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:58.678
And the body appeared hastily handled.

00:36:00.096 --> 00:36:01.430
Thank you.

00:36:01.514 --> 00:36:03.099
In the following murders,

00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:06.978
you can tell he became a different person.

00:36:07.979 --> 00:36:09.563
He began to act more carefully.

00:36:15.861 --> 00:36:18.114
He carried out the killings
more and more skillfully.

00:36:20.616 --> 00:36:23.619
The crime scenes
were cleaned up more thoroughly.

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:26.956
We could hardly find

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:30.459
any traces of him at the crime scenes.

00:36:32.503 --> 00:36:34.505
As he continued killing,

00:36:35.006 --> 00:36:36.757
he became more cold-blooded.

00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:38.968
As in the murder of Lin Meng-hung,

00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:41.178
Li Jen-yao said himself

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:44.974
that, after killing Lin Meng-hung,
he ate the noodles Lin had cooked.

00:36:46.934 --> 00:36:48.978
You can imagine how ruthless he must be

00:36:49.979 --> 00:36:51.731
to be able to eat at the murder scene.

00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:55.443
Think of how indifferent
one must be to killing to do that.

00:36:58.237 --> 00:36:59.238
Officer Lao.

00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:02.783
Based on what I read in the news

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:04.952
from the time Chang En-ya was killed,

00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:09.415
Li Jen-yao burned something at the scene,
but the news didn't say what.

00:37:09.498 --> 00:37:12.793
I'm wondering if you could tell us

00:37:12.877 --> 00:37:15.880
if he burned incriminating evidence.

00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.216
No.

00:37:20.009 --> 00:37:21.927
What Li Jen-yao burned

00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:24.805
were some photos
he took from Chang En-ya's place

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:26.182
and a piece of

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:28.684
ballet wear.

00:38:39.672 --> 00:38:41.340
I wonder, Officer,

00:38:41.424 --> 00:38:44.802
in your personal opinion,

00:38:46.053 --> 00:38:49.432
what's so special about Li Jen-yao
as a murderer?

00:38:52.143 --> 00:38:53.102
There is something.

00:38:55.146 --> 00:38:57.148
All criminals,
even those who turn themselves in,

00:38:58.107 --> 00:39:01.402
try their best to gloss over
the key parts in their confessions.

00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:03.195
But Li Jen-yao

00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:05.698
is the most cooperative criminal
I've ever seen.

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:10.453
From the methods used
to the timeline and locations,

00:39:10.536 --> 00:39:13.664
to how the bodies were disposed of,
he was honest about everything.

00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:17.835
But I just don't understand
why he wouldn't share one thing.

00:39:18.627 --> 00:39:20.379
What is that?

00:39:21.464 --> 00:39:22.715
His motive.

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:28.846
Legally, it no longer matters
whether he killed nine or ten people.

00:39:28.929 --> 00:39:32.391
But he simply won't say
why he had to kill these people

00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:33.726
and how he targeted them.

00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:35.519
That's why I feel like

00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:38.606
he did what he did
to hide some kind of secret.

00:39:39.815 --> 00:39:42.276
Just like people tell many lies

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:44.236
to cover up a single thing.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.243
Okay.

00:39:51.327 --> 00:39:54.788
I'll organize the materials
from the interview with Officer Lao

00:39:54.872 --> 00:39:56.749
and send them to you. Okay.

00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:32.576
Ma'am.

00:40:33.994 --> 00:40:34.828
No.

00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:37.831
You're in a uniform,
so you should be younger than me.

00:40:40.584 --> 00:40:41.919
But that might not be true.

00:40:43.003 --> 00:40:44.129
Whatever.

00:40:44.922 --> 00:40:47.007
Miss.

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:49.385
I just want you to know,

00:40:51.178 --> 00:40:54.598
although we're from different worlds,
I've always respected you.

00:40:54.682 --> 00:40:57.476
I know you arrived first,
and I may have disturbed you,

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.728
but I've paid rent
and the deposit for two months.

00:40:59.812 --> 00:41:01.397
You can't ask me to move out.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.907
I'll move out once I find a place.

00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:13.450
But before then,

00:41:13.534 --> 00:41:15.619
please give me a chance to negotiate.

00:41:19.623 --> 00:41:21.542
I know we're from different worlds.

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:24.336
You shouldn't take it out on me
even if you were wronged.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.548
It's not very nice of you
to possess me whenever you want.

00:41:27.631 --> 00:41:29.800
You should go to the person who hurt you.

00:41:30.759 --> 00:41:31.594
Also,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.680
please don't appear out of the blue.

00:41:34.763 --> 00:41:36.849
Otherwise, I'll get scared.

00:41:37.474 --> 00:41:38.309
Thank you.

00:41:59.413 --> 00:42:01.206
After moving in,

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.003
have you heard heels clacking at night

00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:08.839
or your doorbell ringing continuously?

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:31.612
Hey.

00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:34.156
I was afraid you'd imagine things
being home alone.

00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:35.366
Late-night snacks.

00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:40.663
You're the best.

00:43:44.977 --> 00:43:46.979
I have something to do. Gotta go.

00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:49.398
Don't worry.

00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:51.108
You slept soundly last night.

00:43:51.191 --> 00:43:52.901
Nothing happened.

00:44:01.827 --> 00:44:03.579
Is it really fine now?

00:44:08.876 --> 00:44:10.335
-Here's your package.
-Thank you.

00:44:10.419 --> 00:44:11.962
-It must be tough.
-No worries.

00:44:12.463 --> 00:44:15.632
Ma'am, excuse me.
I want to ask you something.

00:44:15.716 --> 00:44:20.220
Last time, you told me about the girl
who used to rent the place I'm living in.

00:44:20.304 --> 00:44:21.722
How did she die?

00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:23.223
What was her name?

00:44:23.307 --> 00:44:25.225
Sis, listen.

00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:27.686
The previous tenant's name
was Chang En-ya.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.981
She was one of Li Jen-yao's victims.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.358
Just hearing that gives me goosebumps.

00:44:35.444 --> 00:44:36.278
But

00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:40.365
Chang En-ya wasn't
the high school girl I saw.

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:43.786
I'm busy now.

00:44:43.869 --> 00:44:45.496
I'll talk to you later, okay?

00:44:47.331 --> 00:44:49.500
Okay. I'll leave you to it.

00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:22.241
Li Jen-yao.

00:53:04.286 --> 00:53:09.291
