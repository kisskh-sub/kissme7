00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.129
From a very young age, I knew…

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:28.508
I knew I was different from everyone else.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.137
My family…

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:35.390
my family

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:37.392
didn't include a dad

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.310
or a mom.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.438
There was only a grandma
who frightened me.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:46.526
MENG-HUA, ALWAYS LOVE YOU
TAO-MING

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:53.658
That wicked woman

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:55.410
caused your dad's death.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.746
Yet you still want to find her.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.502
She left you to me.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:07.380
She doesn't love you.

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:12.177
I'm the only one in the world
who loves you.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.387
I always wondered

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:17.265
if my grandma really loved me,
as she claimed.

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:19.058
But without her…

00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:20.602
SHEN MENG-HUA, LAI TAO-MING

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.896
…I'd have no family at all.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.899
So I could only trust that she loved me.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.692
SUICIDE FOR LOVE, DAUGHTER LEFT BEHIND

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:29.110
ABUSIVE RICH MAN'S WIFE LEFT

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:30.653
LAI DIES, SHEN GETS MINOR BURNS

00:01:30.737 --> 00:01:32.280
What's more, after I found out

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.825
what had happened to my mom and dad,

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.411
I seemed to understand

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.872
why my grandma treated me this way.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.671
This was fine.

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:52.800
I didn't have much hope
in a life like this anyway.

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:19.577
That was until…

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:21.829
until I met you.

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:42.767
You live life with more passion
than anyone I've met.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.311
You have the brightest smile ever.

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:49.023
You're just like the sun.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.028
I envy you.

00:02:55.113 --> 00:02:57.907
I really envy you.

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.535
I know we're not the same.

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:04.163
But each time I get closer to you,

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:08.084
my world feels less cold.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.755
I feel that I can also live
with a bit more warmth.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.101
You like dancing.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:28.104
And I

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:30.732
like you.

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.853
I won't do it.
Give me a demerit if you want.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.064
Hsiao-tung, calm down.

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:12.023
Think about it.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.358
If you receive a major demerit,

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.818
according to the school policy,
you can't compete.

00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:18.488
It'll also hurt your chances
for future special admission.

00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:19.947
Listen to the instructor.

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.033
Just sign this statement, all right?

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:23.659
Please don't force me, okay?

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:25.787
Things weren't like she said.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.829
Why should I listen?

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.042
Hey, Hsiao-tung.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.753
You must have no idea

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.757
how brave I could be for you.

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:39.217
Ma'am.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:54.065
Hsiao-tung,

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.526
where are you now?

00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:59.612
I miss you so much.

00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:39.212
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:07.740
What happened?

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:11.702
Yun-chen!

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:16.666
Yun-chen.

00:07:30.054 --> 00:07:31.055
Yun-chen.

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:33.683
Come.

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:35.309
Come here.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.697
Where are you running off to?

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:49.448
Come back here!

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:50.426
Yun-chen.

00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:52.470
What's going on?

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:55.806
Tell me, will you?

00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:16.661
Yun-chen.

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:19.205
Tell me what happened, will you?

00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:22.625
I'll support you no matter what.

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:28.547
I will protect you, okay?

00:09:47.983 --> 00:09:50.027
The election is coming.
They're cracking down.

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.238
-You guys need to be extra careful.
-Okay.

00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:55.616
Whoever's selling amulets at the pub
need to be more careful too.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.368
-Only sell to regulars, okay?
-Yes.

00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:58.953
Li Jen-yao is here!

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:00.454
Catch him! Hurry!

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:02.289
Stop!

00:10:03.666 --> 00:10:04.667
Fuck! Stop!

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.335
That bastard.

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.004
Does he take me for a saint?

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:10.965
He ran away just like that.

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:14.927
I'm home!

00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:20.391
It's okay. Come in.

00:10:22.685 --> 00:10:23.769
You can wear these.

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:26.313
-Shoes can go there.
-Okay.

00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:31.569
Yun-chen came.

00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:32.820
She's staying tonight.

00:10:33.487 --> 00:10:34.613
Hello, Mr. Chiang.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.867
So you're Yun-chen.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.202
I finally get to meet you.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:42.371
Hsiao-tung goes on about
Yun-chen every day.

00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:44.290
I've always wondered what she is like.

00:10:44.373 --> 00:10:45.207
Now I see.

00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:48.210
Dad, it's Yun-chen's first time here.

00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:49.962
What if you scare her off?

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:51.213
That's right.

00:10:51.297 --> 00:10:54.133
Our daughter's friend just came over.
Why are you so excited?

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:55.050
Frivolous.

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:56.552
Frivolous.

00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:57.595
Relax.

00:10:57.678 --> 00:11:00.055
If you want me to be serious,
wait until I pass away.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:01.932
I'll be solemn for sure.

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:03.225
No need for that now.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:04.185
Yun-chen.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:05.603
Don't be afraid.

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:07.938
I'm a warm and caring guy.

00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:12.193
Dad, you're so cheesy.
Stop watching idol dramas with mom.

00:11:12.276 --> 00:11:13.652
It doesn't work with you.

00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:15.905
He really isn't a warm guy.

00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:21.452
Let me tell you,
the bubble tea seller next to our stall

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:23.537
calls me the Ming Dao of BBQ vendors.

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:27.958
Stop flattering yourself over there.
Hsiao-tung, get the rice and utensils.

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.294
Okay. Sit wherever you like.

00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:32.296
-Go.
-Yun-chen, come in.

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:33.881
Make yourself at home.

00:11:33.964 --> 00:11:34.799
Okay.

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:38.260
What do we do?
I don't think we have enough food.

00:11:38.344 --> 00:11:39.678
How is this not enough?

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.514
You ate half a chicken alone before.

00:11:41.597 --> 00:11:43.641
When did I eat half a chicken on my own?

00:11:43.724 --> 00:11:46.352
I'll hold back.
I'll give it all to Yun-chen today.

00:11:47.937 --> 00:11:49.480
-Eat more.
-Okay.

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:51.148
You obviously love eating this.

00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:52.775
You should eat more.

00:11:52.858 --> 00:11:55.110
No, I don't. Don't give me away.

00:11:55.194 --> 00:11:57.780
Yun-chen, have some more.
Isn't my mom's cooking amazing?

00:11:57.863 --> 00:11:58.989
Try it.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.033
-Dig in.
-Do you eat eggplant?

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:02.159
Here you go.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.621
Beans. Here, eat more.

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:07.248
Okay.

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:18.717
This is new.

00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:22.304
I don't think we've ever had a sleepover
despite knowing each other forever.

00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:38.737
Yun-chen.

00:12:40.114 --> 00:12:42.741
Did your grandma treat you like that

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:47.079
because she misunderstood
your relationship with Li Jen-yao?

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:50.124
Or…

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.793
or does she also

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:54.628
usually…

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.842
My grandma has always been
very strict with me.

00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:02.428
And she cares about her reputation.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:06.640
She was called in today because of me.

00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:08.100
It made her lose face.

00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:10.978
That's why she did that to me.

00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:15.774
You obviously really hate Li Jen-yao.

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:18.944
Why did you tell the school
that you two are dating?

00:13:20.029 --> 00:13:22.364
I know you probably did it to help me.

00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:25.367
But I can't figure out why.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:34.168
Didn't you say

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:38.088
that you can't wait for
your favorite dancer to see you perform?

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.137
What if you get punished by the school?

00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:47.848
Could you still go on stage?

00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:53.938
The main thing is,
I really want to see you dance.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.732
Of course I had to make sure
you could perform.

00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:03.489
Did you do this
just so that I could perform on stage?

00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:09.536
I said before…

00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:13.874
that I really like you…

00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:24.969
your dancing.

00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:33.185
All right, it's really late.
Let's go to sleep.

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:34.687
Good night.

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:53.789
Thank you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.960
But I don't like this.

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:02.423
If you cry because of me,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.967
I will cry too.

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:11.306
You will never understand

00:15:11.974 --> 00:15:14.143
that, even if I can't protect myself,

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:17.104
I still want to protect you

00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:19.273
more than anyone else does.

00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:37.708
Yun-chen.

00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:40.919
Are you asleep?

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.981
I want ground pepper,

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:05.027
two containers of barbecue sauce,
okay, and seven-spice powder.

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:07.279
Same ground pepper as last time.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:09.490
Okay, and…

00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:11.909
Hey, where are you going?
It's really late already.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.203
To the convenience store.

00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:16.789
Ask your dad to give you a ride.
He's in his room. Dad!

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:18.791
It's okay. I'll be back soon.

00:16:18.874 --> 00:16:20.167
Hey, wait.

00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:24.213
I was talking to my daughter, sorry.

00:17:16.473 --> 00:17:19.059
Li Jen-yao. How come you're here?

00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:26.692
I had to find somewhere for dinner.

00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:28.443
What about you?

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:30.821
Why are you out alone so late at night?

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.365
I was feeling down,

00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:36.368
so I thought I'd go out
to get a drink and some fresh air.

00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.831
Feeling down.

00:17:43.458 --> 00:17:44.960
Is it because of Lai Yun-chen?

00:17:50.048 --> 00:17:52.092
I've known Yun-chen for so long.

00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:55.179
She's never cried around me before.

00:17:56.889 --> 00:18:00.893
I'm her best friend,
yet I can't do anything to help her.

00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:03.103
I feel so useless.

00:18:04.354 --> 00:18:05.731
After all,

00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:08.358
it was my fault that Yun-chen cried.

00:18:14.907 --> 00:18:16.450
Did the school say today

00:18:17.784 --> 00:18:20.120
how they would punish you and Yun-chen?

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:22.456
We only had to sign a pledge.

00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:26.335
The school wanted our promise
to never be alone together again.

00:18:28.378 --> 00:18:31.840
We never interacted much anyway,
so it wouldn't make a difference.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.301
In the end, we both signed it.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:36.511
None of those things happened.

00:18:36.595 --> 00:18:38.555
We were misunderstood.
Why did you sign it?

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:42.935
I'll tell the school tomorrow
that Yun-chen wasn't involved in this.

00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:48.190
I

00:18:48.982 --> 00:18:50.442
am not close to Lai Yun-chen.

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:54.738
But for her to be so concerned,

00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:57.449
she must've had her reasons.

00:19:00.077 --> 00:19:01.745
If you go and explain,

00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:06.083
everything she did
will be for nothing, won't it?

00:19:19.554 --> 00:19:20.514
Let's go.

00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:28.981
Thank you.

00:19:36.613 --> 00:19:38.991
Where's the stuff? I'm here.

00:19:41.702 --> 00:19:43.328
You have five minutes, tops.

00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:44.371
Hurry up.

00:19:50.627 --> 00:19:51.795
Thank you.

00:20:11.773 --> 00:20:12.983
Let me help you.

00:20:14.067 --> 00:20:15.861
Okay. Thank you.

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:24.703
Done.

00:20:41.261 --> 00:20:43.221
So where are you taking me?

00:20:45.599 --> 00:20:46.641
Nowhere in particular.

00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:50.020
I wanna take you out for some fresh air
before taking you home.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.772
What fresh air?

00:20:54.024 --> 00:20:55.984
Whenever I feel down,

00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:58.070
I go for a ride to feel the breeze.

00:20:59.654 --> 00:21:00.655
Perhaps

00:21:01.531 --> 00:21:03.492
this will make you feel better too.

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:06.703
Really?

00:21:08.872 --> 00:21:12.542
So were you feeling down
when that car crash happened?

00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:19.925
Don't close your eyes this time.

00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:24.179
Don't worry.

00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:26.765
I won't, not with you.

00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:34.981
What were you thinking about

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:37.401
when your eyes were closed?

00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:43.073
I was thinking about

00:21:44.408 --> 00:21:49.413
leaving all those unhappy things behind.

00:21:53.583 --> 00:21:55.210
Does that really work?

00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:00.090
I don't know.

00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:03.969
You can try it.

00:24:31.116 --> 00:24:32.200
Hey.

00:24:32.284 --> 00:24:34.244
On a night like this,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.746
when you take me for a ride,

00:24:37.497 --> 00:24:39.416
passing streetlight after streetlight,

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:41.876
doesn't it feel like

00:24:42.377 --> 00:24:44.462
we're getting out of here

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:48.008
and going somewhere where nobody knows us,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.177
to embark on a big adventure?

00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:55.473
Do you know what I mean?

00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:59.436
Yeah. I kind of get it.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.355
Do you feel better now?

00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:05.525
Yes.

00:25:06.318 --> 00:25:08.111
I just wish

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:11.698
that this road was a little bit longer

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.908
so we wouldn't have to stop.

00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:18.288
Just drop me off at this intersection.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.499
Thank you.

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:26.755
If you drop me off at my door,

00:25:26.838 --> 00:25:29.215
my dad will rush out
and ask all about your family.

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:32.844
You don't want to be here
tomorrow morning,

00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:35.096
still talking about
your great-great-great-grandpa.

00:25:43.563 --> 00:25:45.732
Well, I'm going… I'm going home.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.443
Okay.

00:25:49.444 --> 00:25:50.362
Okay.

00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.535
Bye. See you tomorrow.

00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:00.497
See you tomorrow.

00:26:30.276 --> 00:26:31.861
CHIANG'S BARBECUE

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:34.906
I have dance practice today,
so I can't skip school to be with you.

00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:36.491
Do you want to stay at my place?

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:39.869
But my parents' stall won't open
until the afternoon.

00:26:39.953 --> 00:26:42.914
If you're afraid it'll be awkward,
I can tell my mom--

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:46.418
Can you lend me a school uniform
and some shoes?

00:26:51.297 --> 00:26:53.842
I think I should still go to school today.

00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:55.427
Are you sure?

00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:00.223
My grandma might look for me at school.

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:01.975
If she can't find me,

00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:04.936
she might go to you and cause a scene.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.855
I won't let her do that.

00:27:08.231 --> 00:27:09.524
But…

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:10.650
Hey.

00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:16.322
If you feel guilty, then buy me breakfast.

00:27:16.948 --> 00:27:18.783
Don't forget, I didn't bring any money.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.034
I'm relying on you today.

00:27:21.035 --> 00:27:24.247
No problem. Leave it to me.
I'll get you a uniform.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.010
It's gym class next.

00:27:37.093 --> 00:27:39.012
Go get changed if you haven't already.

00:27:39.095 --> 00:27:40.555
Gather at the sports field.

00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:44.684
Stop reading. Go get changed quickly.

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:47.854
Hey, Ouyang, go get changed.

00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:49.397
Let's get going.

00:27:49.481 --> 00:27:52.484
Chuang Jung-tai,
tell the teacher I forgot my gym clothes.

00:27:52.567 --> 00:27:53.943
I'll study in the classroom.

00:27:54.027 --> 00:27:54.986
Okay.

00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:01.201
Li Jen-yao, why aren't you changing?

00:28:01.785 --> 00:28:03.328
Did you forget yours too?

00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:09.167
Hey, I heard that our class leader
was the one Li Jen-yao banged.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.710
Seriously? Our class leader?

00:28:10.794 --> 00:28:13.171
Your crush has slept with him so much
that he's over it.

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:14.964
-Why is your hair green?
-Shut up.

00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:15.882
WANG YU-HSIANG

00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:17.050
Hey, Lai Yun-chen.

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:20.386
Did you two spend the night together
at a hotel yesterday?

00:28:21.137 --> 00:28:24.265
Why else did you both happen to
forget your gym clothes?

00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:25.475
Well?

00:28:26.434 --> 00:28:29.771
It's so nice to be handsome.
You can even sleep with the class leader.

00:28:29.854 --> 00:28:31.856
Isn't that right?

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.900
Tell us.

00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:36.528
Was it good?

00:28:36.611 --> 00:28:39.197
-Awesome, wasn't it? Tell us about it.
-Hey.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.783
Was it good?

00:28:41.866 --> 00:28:43.034
Must've been great.

00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:44.786
Good, yeah? Did it feel good?

00:28:52.877 --> 00:28:55.046
Now that felt good.

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:56.881
Fuck! How dare you slap me!

00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:02.762
Hey, Jung-tai.

00:29:10.603 --> 00:29:11.479
Back off!

00:29:11.563 --> 00:29:13.565
-Fuck, I'm bleeding.
-What are you doing?

00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:18.194
Motherfucker!

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.540
-Grab him!
-Fuck.

00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.375
Fuck.

00:29:32.876 --> 00:29:33.960
You asked for it.

00:29:35.336 --> 00:29:36.254
You're nuts.

00:29:42.135 --> 00:29:43.553
Step aside. I've got it.

00:29:46.097 --> 00:29:47.390
What are you guys doing?!

00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:05.617
Do you know why you're in my office?

00:30:11.623 --> 00:30:12.498
Well?

00:30:14.834 --> 00:30:15.668
Ask Li Jen-yao.

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:17.253
He started it.

00:30:17.962 --> 00:30:21.382
We were just joking. God knows why,
he suddenly went nuts and punched me.

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:24.135
That's right.
I saw him run over to beat Yu-hsiang.

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:26.095
I went to break up the fight.

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:27.472
He ended up beating me too.

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:29.599
Sir, look. He hit me here.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.477
We were really trying to stop the fight.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.519
A bunch of excuses!

00:30:34.854 --> 00:30:36.105
I don't want to hear it.

00:30:36.773 --> 00:30:38.399
I don't care about your feuds.

00:30:38.483 --> 00:30:40.693
I just want to know
what to do with you guys.

00:30:40.777 --> 00:30:43.446
Sir. You once said

00:30:43.529 --> 00:30:45.448
initiators get a major demerit.

00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:46.991
Retaliators get a minor demerit.

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:49.911
Other students who are present
but do not step away,

00:30:49.994 --> 00:30:52.163
stop the fight, or alert teachers

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:55.500
are all considered agitators
and get a warning.

00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:59.504
So Che-li and I are willing
to accept a warning as our punishment.

00:31:01.005 --> 00:31:03.424
You remember it quite well. Thank you.

00:31:05.718 --> 00:31:06.636
Li Jen-yao.

00:31:07.637 --> 00:31:09.764
If you receive a major demerit
for this fight,

00:31:10.932 --> 00:31:12.809
you will definitely be expelled.

00:31:13.685 --> 00:31:15.144
How about this?

00:31:15.228 --> 00:31:18.231
Hurry and fill out a withdrawal form
before you're expelled.

00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:20.274
You could still return later.

00:31:22.944 --> 00:31:24.195
Expel me if you want.

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:26.322
All right, then we'll expel you.

00:31:26.406 --> 00:31:28.074
See if any school even takes you!

00:31:28.157 --> 00:31:30.910
Sir, I haven't spoken yet. May I?

00:31:31.494 --> 00:31:32.537
Fine. Let's hear it.

00:31:33.496 --> 00:31:36.207
I slapped Wang Yu-hsiang.
He got mad and wanted to hit back.

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:37.250
Jen-yao stopped him.

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:40.044
That's why you all got into a brawl.

00:31:40.128 --> 00:31:41.212
Why didn't anyone say that?

00:31:41.879 --> 00:31:45.717
What, Lai Yun-chen?
Don't defend him just 'cause he's yours.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.801
Well, I am.

00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:50.138
Didn't you guys tease us
'cause you learned he's my boyfriend

00:31:50.221 --> 00:31:52.849
and claimed
that we slept together yesterday?

00:31:52.932 --> 00:31:57.103
Sir, I was the one who started the fight,
so I should be the one who gets a demerit.

00:31:57.186 --> 00:31:59.939
But I remember
when my grandma picked me up yesterday,

00:32:00.023 --> 00:32:03.276
the school assured her
that if we kept our promise,

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:05.111
nobody would bring up the incident, right?

00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:07.155
Shouldn't the school be held responsible?

00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:08.197
I accept punishment,

00:32:08.865 --> 00:32:11.701
but Wang and the others
should be punished more heavily.

00:32:17.957 --> 00:32:19.834
All right, this ends here.

00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:22.170
Both sides are at fault.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.506
Hey, you guys,
submit an apology letter tomorrow.

00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:27.842
-500 words.
-Sir.

00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:29.677
Enough. Go back to class.

00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:32.430
Any more fuss
and you'll stand at the school entrance.

00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.480
TAICHUNG MUNICIPAL YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:58.247
Lai Yun-chen.

00:33:03.252 --> 00:33:04.337
Just now…

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:07.173
Thank you.

00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:10.843
What is it now?

00:33:11.803 --> 00:33:13.096
Are you and I close?

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:14.305
Why did you thank me?

00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:17.683
Why did you care
that Wang and his guys picked on me?

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:21.229
Don't assume that I'll see you as a friend
just because Hsiao-tung does.

00:33:21.729 --> 00:33:24.023
Let me tell you, I won't.

00:33:26.567 --> 00:33:27.902
And right now,

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:31.197
I hate you even more than before.

00:33:32.907 --> 00:33:33.950
I'm warning you.

00:33:34.951 --> 00:33:38.162
No matter how much your life sucks,
that's your own business.

00:33:38.246 --> 00:33:39.580
Don't drag Hsiao-tung into it.

00:33:40.081 --> 00:33:42.792
If I find out
you've got Hsiao-tung into any trouble,

00:33:44.335 --> 00:33:45.586
mark my words,

00:33:46.796 --> 00:33:48.297
I won't let you get away with it.

00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:17.952
Shall we go?

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.999
I haven't been back for a whole day.

00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:25.877
But my grandma didn't send
anyone to look for me,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.336
nor did she try to contact me.

00:34:28.004 --> 00:34:30.423
She didn't even come to school
to pick me up.

00:34:31.591 --> 00:34:33.509
She didn't do anything.

00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:35.094
That's so unlike her.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.145
I've said it many times.

00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:46.439
Our child just had a friend over.

00:34:46.522 --> 00:34:47.565
That's all.

00:34:47.648 --> 00:34:49.442
Why did you make it seem like
we kidnapped her?

00:34:50.401 --> 00:34:52.486
Hey, Chiang Hsiao-tung.
You got here in time.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:53.905
Let me ask you.

00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:56.449
Excuse me.

00:34:57.408 --> 00:34:59.619
We're in trouble.

00:35:04.123 --> 00:35:06.125
They told the police we kidnapped her.

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:07.668
What? How could that happen?

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:09.378
That's what I'm asking you.

00:35:09.462 --> 00:35:11.422
You'd better explain it to me.

00:35:11.505 --> 00:35:14.091
Didn't I ask you yesterday
if you'd told her family?

00:35:14.175 --> 00:35:15.635
Who did you tell?

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:22.725
Besides going behind my back
to get a secret boyfriend

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:26.604
and befriend that girl
who helped you run away from home,

00:35:27.188 --> 00:35:29.523
what else have you been hiding from me?

00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:32.568
What other shameful things have you done?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.827
It doesn't matter if you don't speak.

00:35:42.453 --> 00:35:44.288
At least now I know

00:35:44.914 --> 00:35:47.458
where to find you if you go missing.

00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:53.089
As for that bad student
who helped you run away from home,

00:35:53.172 --> 00:35:55.591
her family runs a roadside stall.

00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:57.885
I wonder if she can stand

00:35:58.386 --> 00:36:01.889
the police and health officers
issuing them tickets every day.

00:36:08.104 --> 00:36:08.980
Grandma.

00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:12.233
I know I was wrong.

00:36:13.401 --> 00:36:16.153
I will never lie to you again.

00:36:17.154 --> 00:36:19.031
I promise I'll listen to you.

00:36:21.784 --> 00:36:23.703
This was all my fault.

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:28.666
I'm the one to blame.
I pampered and spoiled you too much.

00:36:30.167 --> 00:36:31.836
From now on,

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:34.505
I will be stricter with you.

00:37:00.114 --> 00:37:02.908
YI-NO HIGH SCHOOL

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:06.996
How's that possible?

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.831
That's my turf.

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:10.791
I've never seen Li Jen-yao go there.

00:37:11.417 --> 00:37:12.376
Fuck. How would I know?

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.545
Anyway, I saw him.
So I asked the shopkeeper.

00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:16.922
She said he spent
the past few nights there.

00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:19.467
Damn, why did he sleep there?
He ran away from home?

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:22.386
Fuck.

00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:26.223
What's that?

00:37:27.475 --> 00:37:29.643
Shit, what do you want to do with that?

00:37:29.727 --> 00:37:31.437
What do you think? To jump him!

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.563
Do you want to come?

00:37:32.646 --> 00:37:34.065
-Yes or no?
-Let's go.

00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:40.112
You two done barking yet?

00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:43.574
Please don't be so ridiculous, okay?

00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:47.411
If you go beat him up, then what?

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:51.207
For fuck's sake,
will Li Jen-yao fear us because of this?

00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:53.125
No.

00:37:53.209 --> 00:37:55.544
Everything will stay the same.

00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:57.713
It's pointless.

00:38:10.434 --> 00:38:12.353
So if we really want to mess with him,

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.147
we'd better be sure it ends him.

00:38:19.693 --> 00:38:21.862
We have to make sure
his whole life will be ruined,

00:38:22.613 --> 00:38:25.783
that he won't even get
a chance to start over,

00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:30.287
that from now on,
when he wakes up every morning

00:38:30.371 --> 00:38:33.541
and opens his eyes,
his first thought will be,

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:35.751
"Fuck."

00:38:36.877 --> 00:38:37.962
"I'm fucking doomed."

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.424
"My life is ruined."

00:38:41.507 --> 00:38:44.176
"Why don't I just kill myself?"

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.097
"Why did I mess with Ouyang Ti
and his guys for no reason?"

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:54.520
"Why didn't I just be
his good little lapdog?"

00:38:57.106 --> 00:38:58.065
Fuck!

00:38:58.566 --> 00:39:00.443
Isn't that much more fun?

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:01.569
Damn.

00:39:01.652 --> 00:39:03.821
Ouyang, what you just said made me hard.

00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:04.989
So what's your plan?

00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:29.013
It's me.

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:32.683
I want you to do something for me.

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.368
Where's my phone?

00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:58.751
Don't bother searching.

00:39:59.585 --> 00:40:00.920
I've got your phone.

00:40:02.463 --> 00:40:04.882
Also, get out of your uniform.

00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:08.385
Starting today,
you don't need to go to school.

00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:12.181
I'll ask someone
to handle the withdrawal process for you.

00:40:12.264 --> 00:40:14.141
What do you mean?

00:40:14.225 --> 00:40:16.810
I've made
all the other arrangements for you.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.939
For now, study on your own at home.

00:40:21.273 --> 00:40:22.566
Grandma.

00:40:23.067 --> 00:40:24.193
Grandma!

00:40:25.819 --> 00:40:26.904
Grandma, open the door!

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.741
Grandma!

00:40:48.259 --> 00:40:50.553
-My face hurts.
-Didn't think it could swell any more.

00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:52.805
It did. Damn, it still hurts.

00:40:53.597 --> 00:40:54.807
I told you to buy us food.

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:58.310
Trash, don't block the path.

00:40:59.186 --> 00:41:00.020
Move aside.

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:04.525
-The hell are you looking at?
-What?

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:07.194
Good morning.

00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:13.576
Hey.

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:15.744
The class leader
is withdrawing from school.

00:41:15.828 --> 00:41:16.662
Really?

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:22.793
She withdrew from school?

00:41:23.294 --> 00:41:25.504
Yeah. I heard about it from our teacher.

00:41:25.588 --> 00:41:28.465
She's going to the US for school,
flying out next week.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:29.842
How's that possible?

00:41:29.925 --> 00:41:31.927
Yun-chen never told me about this.

00:41:32.011 --> 00:41:33.887
I don't know the details either.

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:40.269
The number you dialed is not available.

00:41:44.189 --> 00:41:45.858
The number you dialed is not available.

00:42:42.414 --> 00:42:44.249
The number you dialed is not available.

00:42:44.333 --> 00:42:46.085
Please try again later.

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:51.173
The number you dialed is not available.

00:42:51.256 --> 00:42:53.258
Please try again later.

00:43:05.187 --> 00:43:06.146
Hey.

00:43:18.325 --> 00:43:19.368
Kiddo.

00:43:30.754 --> 00:43:32.506
Why are you so scared?

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:34.633
We were just being kind
by bringing you home.

00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.510
You act like
we're gonna do something to you.

00:43:36.593 --> 00:43:38.721
What? What will I do to you?

00:43:39.763 --> 00:43:41.432
-What are you doing?
-Hold him.

00:43:41.515 --> 00:43:42.683
Fuck you.

00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:45.227
Sit still.

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:46.937
Got something to tell you.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.148
Okay.

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:53.569
This batch of goods is for you.

00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:55.195
Don't worry about it.

00:43:55.279 --> 00:43:57.156
I have already paid for you.

00:43:57.239 --> 00:43:59.825
How much you sell each packet for
is up to you.

00:43:59.908 --> 00:44:03.579
I'm gonna charge you 1,200 NTD each,
for a total of…

00:44:03.662 --> 00:44:05.456
-Eighteen packets.
-So how much in total?

00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:07.624
-Uh…
-Damn.

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:10.127
Take them away!

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.545
I won't sell them for you!

00:44:16.133 --> 00:44:18.927
I used to find your stubbornness
quite cute.

00:44:19.553 --> 00:44:20.763
What now?

00:44:20.846 --> 00:44:22.681
Are you trying to embarrass me?

00:44:24.266 --> 00:44:25.559
Then I'm gonna get rough.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.379
If you want to really enjoy
this good stuff…

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:57.674
shoot it up.

00:44:57.758 --> 00:44:59.551
It hits you faster and stronger.

00:45:01.845 --> 00:45:03.972
Hey, don't be such a brat.

00:45:04.056 --> 00:45:06.517
I've been doing this for over 20 years,

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.811
and I'm acting like a call girl

00:45:08.894 --> 00:45:12.856
giving you in-home service
for your first time to make you feel good.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.573
Since this is your first shot,
I have to tell you two things.

00:45:21.657 --> 00:45:24.701
First, needles are like condoms.

00:45:24.785 --> 00:45:26.286
Gotta use a new one every time.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.248
When you bone a girl,
you can't have a used condom, right?

00:45:29.331 --> 00:45:31.083
Don't be such a cheapskate!

00:45:33.085 --> 00:45:34.127
Second…

00:45:41.426 --> 00:45:42.886
When I inject it,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:45.514
you have to hold back,
no matter how good it feels.

00:45:45.597 --> 00:45:46.682
Don't move around.

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:49.101
If this needle breaks off inside,

00:45:50.644 --> 00:45:51.979
that will be a problem.

00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:56.567
Let's go!

00:47:04.384 --> 00:47:05.928
Here, smile.

00:54:27.994 --> 00:54:32.999
