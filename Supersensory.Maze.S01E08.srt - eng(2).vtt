00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.870
Why do we have to review

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.200
Hu Bo's movements on the footage?

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.230
You can't rely solely on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.840
what a witness saw.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.000
Let me show you two photos.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.310
Is it the same person?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Or not the same person?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.070
They are two very similar people.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.400
Mistakes happen because

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.760
you don't know them,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.200
and the photos are still images,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.150
so you can't judge just by expression

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.150
or posture.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.070
Now, let me show you two videos.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.430
They are completely different.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.590
If you've only seen

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.000
one person's photo,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.950
no matter whose photo

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.870
I show you,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.040
you'll likely think it's the one

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.000
you know.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.120
And if they're wearing a hat and mask?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.800
I'd recognize them even less.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.470
No wonder last time, Captain Yin

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.000
and I went to track Hu Bo.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.080
The hotel owner and neighbors

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.240
all said they had seen him,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.710
but when we showed them

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.190
the footage, they said they hadn't.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.560
Knowledge shouldn't be rigid.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.240
I'm still learning.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.560
Only what we cannot imagine exists.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080
Mr. Xu, can I go to the restroom?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960
I'll wait for you.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360
Mr. Xu!

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.080
Witness bias!

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.590
Mr. Xu,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.000
you're being empathetic with me.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.080
This is all the surveillance footage

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.310
from March 15th.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.750
We originally thought Hu Bo

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.150
escaped after killing Wu Xinxin

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.080
and Liu Wanyao.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.710
But Hu Bo had been dead for over a month.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.400
Then who killed Liu Wanyao?

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.870
Was it the same person who killed

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.710
both Liu and Hu?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.550
Why?

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.840
Why are you all sweaty?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.120
The surveillance room is too hot.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.040
I even feel cold in my feet.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.440
You're younger.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.120
The answer is in your notebook.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.000
On March 15th,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.070
Hu Bo was already

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.910
a corpse.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.720
A corpse can't walk around.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.070
Then who is in the footage?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.510
Captain He,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.270
the number you got the call from is virtual.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.510
We can't trace the owner.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.830
According to the timeline,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.160
this was Liu Wanyao's last sighting

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
before she was killed.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.430
Could the one who killed Hu Bo and the others

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.600
be the same one?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.560
Also,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.480
a screenshot of Hu Bo's withdrawal

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.000
on March 15th,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.840
captures this person.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.390
On the afternoon of March 15,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.000
footage shows that the person impersonating

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.310
Hu Bo for a withdrawal

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.920
is the same one

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240
arguing with Liu Wanyao.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.270
That's him.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.950
This guy's called Ding Chuan.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.950
He was wanted for murder

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.680
and fell off a cliff while resisting arrest.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.430
He's been declared dead.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.480
Dead?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.870
His household record's canceled.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.040
This case happened several years ago.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.190
(Name: Ding Chuan, deceased)
If he were alive, he would be...

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.950
28 years old.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.430
How can the dead still be alive?

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.900
(Wanted Notice)

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.110
Hello?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.120
I'm safe now.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.710
I'll take care of it.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.310
The phone used for reporting

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.680
has been thrown away, as you asked.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.120
The car has been

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.070
parked there for so long

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.630
that you'll have to pay for the car wash

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.600
and the dash cam.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.390
Do you believe people can rise from the dead?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.310
You mean Ding Chuan?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160
Truly dead or faked death?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.390
You mean Lu Ran, right?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.900
(Biological DNA Test Report)

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.820
(Parentage Test: Wu Min and Zhuang Mingcheng)

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.320
(The biological relationship
could not be confirmed.)

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.040
You have this report, huh?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.430
I know you can't let go

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.390
of Aunt Min's case.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.190
I've looked into this person.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.920
He's just a friend

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.830
Lu Ran met abroad.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.600
They only look a little alike.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.950
Everyone has their crazy moments.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.630
Don't you have your license?

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.160
Doctors can't treat themselves, huh?

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.000
Go ahead and book me

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.270
with a specialist.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.270
I really need

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.110
a thorough check-up.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.920
Alright.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.080
Captain He,

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.720
we found strange symbols

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.870
on Hu Bo's bones.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.360
If something's up, just say.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.960
I don't want anyone else to see me.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.870
I'm here to give something back.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.180
(Zhao Xiaozhe)

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.150
- You...
- Your son is fine.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.630
I mean, he's fine now.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.960
Whether he'll always

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.360
be fine is uncertain.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.240
You're crazy!

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.710
Hello?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.920
Yes, honey.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.510
Is Xiaozhe okay?

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.350
Is he with you?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440
He...

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.200
What are you doing?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.390
Why not let her hear?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.320
Then let's show her.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.200
At your son's

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.720
kindergarten performance,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.960
everyone will point at

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
you and your wife.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.150
Your son will seriously ask,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.750
"Dad, who's that lady?"

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.030
- "What are you doing?"
- Stop it.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.510
At your company's team-building event,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.790
this video will also be shown.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.030
All your colleagues

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.080
will quietly be gossiping,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.910
"Didn't expect

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.550
Mr. Zhao to be like this."

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.320
Stop it. Stop it.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.510
You want money, right?

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.600
Just tell me how much.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440
I don't want money.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.080
Someone wants me to tell you

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.080
that the truth is out there.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.390
It will eventually be found.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.440
Are you sure

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.840
these marks were originally there?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.870
We first thought it was a coincidence.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.240
But on the victim's

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.720
other arm and leg bones,

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.750
there were no matching nails,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.390
only on this side,

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.270
in a regular pattern.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.630
We only noticed something

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.030
strange when we photographed

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.030
the bones yesterday.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.960
Check Morse code.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.870
Hello?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.030
Hello? Are you Officer Xu?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.870
Yes.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.440
- You asked me call you
- Check this out.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.480
when Mr. Zhao's back.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.390
He'll have a meeting this afternoon.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.240
He just called

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.080
and told us to prepare.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.080
Okay.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.790
So I come now?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.840
Yes.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.750
Captain He,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.720
Zhao Xueli is back.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.560
I should go.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.480
Bring Liu Ming with you.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.920
Okay.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.550
Does the police suspect Mr. Zhao?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.030
He must be involved in this.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.670
It's hard to explain.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.910
I don't know.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.080
Finance Unit took projects?

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.030
There must be something fishy.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.900
(Jinrun Investment Group)

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.750
That's destroying evidence.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.360
I didn't expect Mr. Hu would be like this.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.790
Hello,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.660
I'm Liu Ming,

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.140
(Police)
CIU 1 Officer.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.630
This is my colleague.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.200
- Hi, Mr. Zhao.
- Hi, Officer.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240
Your hands are so sweaty.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.910
Remember to stay hydrated

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.960
and get enough rest.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.390
Are you overworked

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.480
without Hu Bo,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.240
your capable right-hand?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.870
He hadn't worked for days.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.790
My colleagues and I were very worried.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.870
What an incident.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.000
That's a reason to worry.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.270
Please sit down.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.800
- Mr. Zhao, please.
- You too.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.910
Who did he go with?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.230
Liu Ming.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.240
Alright, I got it.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.080
Okay.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.440
Please ask whatever you want.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.380
I'll answer everything I know.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.790
We'd like to ask you something

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.630
about Hu Bo.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.960
Well, Hu Bo...

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.740
(Unknown)

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.240
Please wait. I need to take this call.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.080
Okay.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.110
Officer Liu,

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.750
I've got a lead.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.320
It's about Hu Bo.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.750
I want to tell you in detail.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.270
How many years has your company been around?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.200
Thirteen years.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.040
No,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.390
twelve years.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.320
Quite a long time.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.600
What have you been doing

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.840
for twelve years?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.910
We do financial consulting.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.790
What did Hu Bo do in the company?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.390
He only handled

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.480
our internal financial management.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.320
He was introverted.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.630
(If you want to stay safe,)

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.120
(tell me the mastermind)

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960
(behind you.)

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.110
(Otherwise,)

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.480
(your wife and son will die.)

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.840
Double-layer encryption.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.080
We need the key

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.320
to unlock the final message.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.840
Let me try.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.550
(The police found you.)

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.510
(Keep your mouth shut.)

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.720
(I'll be there in a minute.)

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.560
(You're coming with me.)

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.800
Was Hu Bo

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.270
on good terms with his wife?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.870
My wife is a terrible cook.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.320
I promised my son

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.270
I'd take him out for burgers.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.200
If I bail on him again,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.440
he'll definitely be mad.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.320
Don't get me wrong.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.200
My son is actually really cute.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040
Really cute.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.320
You know, Officer Xu,

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.960
I'm not feeling well today.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.030
If you don't have other questions...

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.910
But I do.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.790
I didn't know

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.000
you weren't feeling well today, Mr. Zhao.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.600
I'll give you my number.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.440
- Let's stay in touch...
- I'll get them.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.550
Paper and pen.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.480
Got them right here.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.960
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.750
The truth will be found.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.280
See you around.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.710
See you.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.750
Take care.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.960
Mr. Xu?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.200
This is the first time

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.270
you've called me on your own.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.720
Does your overseas company

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.080
have the technology to erase

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.920
human biological data?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.120
Why are you suddenly

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120
interested in that?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.390
That's classified.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.440
I can't disclose it.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.870
So you do have it.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.390
Mr. Xu,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.120
no wonder you and Lu Ran were like brothers.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.030
He asked me the same thing.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.750
But

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.480
why do you think

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.320
Lu Ran asked?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.030
I'd like to know that too.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.200
He once said

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.200
he hated where he came from.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.440
He felt like he was a monster

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
who shouldn't have existed in this world.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.270
So,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.910
even the brother he admired most

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.480
didn't want him around.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840
He wanted to know

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.960
whether, without the DNA

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.840
of Lu Youliang,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.470
that rapist, inside him,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600
could he have lived

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.360
a different life?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.640
Lu Ran is dead.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.510
What are you trying to say?

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.000
Lu Ran fought desperately to change his fate,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.550
hoping the world would accept him.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.200
I think he was

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.040
too naïve.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.830
He didn't need approval

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.110
from the whole world,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.200
only from the people

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.350
he cared about.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.830
I've heard you have extraordinary empathy.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.840
So, I think

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.680
you must understand him,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.190
right?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.790
The Morse code on Hu Bo's bones

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.400
leads to an encrypted website.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.520
Give me a second.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.420
(Login)

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.300
(Website Login System)

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.160
Xu Jingzhi?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.820
(Liu Wanyao)

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.350
Why's Xu Jingzhi's name on it?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.060
What?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.280
Any chance he survived?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.480
He's definitely dead.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.480
He jumped from that height.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.200
This is terrifying.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.640
I called the police.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.000
Alright, move along.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.950
Let's go.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.400
Mai Boyuan...

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.110
Sorry,

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.160
the number you have reached

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.590
is not available at this time.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.920
Please try again later.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.480
What are you trying to say?

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.280
Stop filming.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.510
Stop filming.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.590
Alright, keep me updated.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.160
The clues on Hu Bo's body

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.270
now all point to Xu Jingzhi.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.310
He is very likely

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.640
the killer's next target.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.800
I'm requesting

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.030
personal protection for him.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.110
But nothing's been confirmed yet.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.350
How can you request protection?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.240
I know you're worried about him,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.160
but you're a cop.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.270
Can you stay calm when things happen?

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.950
Director Feng.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.390
Captain He.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.030
Mr. Xu is in trouble.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.820
(Xu Jingzhi)

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.670
Xu Jingzhi,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.510
do you know how serious a mistake you've made?

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.200
A life was lost,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.960
and the investigation hit a dead end.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.160
Why didn't you wait for your colleague?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.400
I should've waited for my colleague

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.790
before continuing.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.480
Did you ask Zhao Xueli any

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.590
aggressive questions?

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.160
Zhao Xueli was only an informant,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.070
not a suspect.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220
Just a routine inquiry.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.940
Routine inquiry?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.860
Right after your routine inquiry,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.140
he killed himself.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.580
And you clearly know

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.700
that without other

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.580
colleagues present,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.180
you are forbidden to inquire.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.980
Before the inquiry,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.180
I sensed

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.980
his condition wasn't good.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.020
Maybe something happened at home,

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.300
or maybe he was hiding something.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.060
What did Zhao Xueli say to you

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.900
before he died?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.580
I didn't hear.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.980
What is your relationship with Hu Bo?

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.380
Police-and-suspect

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.660
before,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.940
and police-and-victim

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.060
at present.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.620
But why

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.260
did the code on his arm bone

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.540
point to you?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.740
Ask the murderer.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.740
I was investigating him.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.660
What do you think? Do I look good?

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.060
I always wanted to wear this for someone.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.220
Who hit you?

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.020
A dead man.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.500
Thank you for teaching me

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.020
how to avenge Xinxin.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.700
If I'd had this resolve earlier,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.580
maybe she wouldn't have died.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.540
What a pity.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.860
I was only happy for three days

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.140
before becoming a dead person.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.140
He hit you again?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.580
I'm fine.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.300
I have a plan now.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.420
Hu Bo's helping Xu Yi manage

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.020
the ledgers for buying and selling girls.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.900
Can you get them?

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.460
Threaten him with the ledgers

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.540
and make him let you go.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.260
But...

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.500
It's a deal, ledgers in exchange

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.300
for the divorce papers.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.060
Would that really work?

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.580
I'm wearing

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.740
Xinxin's favorite dress.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.340
Who's next after Zhao Xueli?

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.500
Xu Yi,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.740
you know that.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.940
I mean above him.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060
It will get complicated,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.700
but don't worry.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.620
I'll deliver everything

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.260
I promised you.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.300
But I'm curious.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.580
How does my death

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.700
fit into your plan?

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.300
Why did you want me
to leave blood at the scene?

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.020
Your initial identity

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.860
in the police system

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.700
is victim.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.180
Only that way

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.100
will they bypass you

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.860
and go straight to Hu Bo.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.900
But I don't think so.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.060
Your cop brother

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.340
seems close to finding me.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.260
If he wants to investigate you,

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.580
he must follow

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.660
the path I laid out,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.380
step by step,

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.820
deeper and deeper.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.820
By now,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.380
he should've received

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.660
the gift I left for him.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.580
From now on,

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.780
he's no longer be a police officer.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.340
He's our partner.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.700
He taught me all of this.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.340
Now,

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.820
we're taking disciplinary action against you.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.380
You are temporarily suspended.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.500
Xu Jingzhi, you know what?

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.260
Sometimes, when faced with conspiracy theories,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.300
being too perfect is no different
from being foolish.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.140
A fool can't see what's happening

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.780
and blames every unreasonable thing

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.740
on a nonexistent mastermind.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.180
The smart ones, meanwhile,

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.700
create a flawless logic

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.100
that never actually existed.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.540
Not every Sherlock Holmes

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.460
has a Moriarty.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.180
Zhao Xueli's death

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.500
must have been done by Mai Boyuan.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.700
He hasn't retrieved the ledgers

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.700
and has started settling scores with us.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.380
Well?

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.900
Have you thought it through?

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.940
Give me two more days.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.740
Mai Boyuan and Gao

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.700
won't let us go.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.660
Only if we both die

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.820
will the ledgers

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.700
truly vanish without a trace.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.540
Right now,

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.340
we must throw them into chaos

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.460
to find a way to escape.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.620
Is the sex-bribery footage I have

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.340
really that useful?

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.460
If it ends up in the police's hands,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.660
we'll be in great trouble.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.780
Use both the footage and the ledgers

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.140
to threaten Mr. Gao.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.860
Then find an excuse

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.700
to pass everything to Mai Boyuan.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.620
As long as Gao believes

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.820
Mai Boyuan did it,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.140
that's our chance.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.620
Will your plan really work?

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.020
Absolutely.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.300
The sooner, the better.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.900
If we don't move now,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.620
it'll be too late.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.500
Once those two are dead,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.300
and we forge some evidence,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.660
we'll come out clean.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.340
Xu...

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.100
Starting now,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.300
you must catch

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.140
the real killer

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.180
of the Hu Bo case within seven days.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.260
Can you do that?

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.900
All the clues

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.180
point to Ding Chuan now.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.220
We've issued a warrant...

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.300
I don't want the process.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.540
We'll get it done.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.820
How tall?

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.660
Kiddo,

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.940
just tell me

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.500
which part of that adult do you reach?

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.220
Waist?

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:27.980
Chest?

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.100
You can just point.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.900
I...

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.060
That's okay.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.740
It's totally fine.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.100
Whenever you remember,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.660
just tell me, Uncle He.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.620
She said she was lost,

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.900
so I took her there.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.540
Her name was Hong.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.540
I came up to her shoulders.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.220
She was about

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.500
1.55 meters tall.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.660
Right here.

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.940
He handled pickup and kidnapping.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.340
His name was Yu,

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.220
around 1.8 meters tall.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.940
He was shorter than the other man,

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.220
who was 1.75 meters.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.980
I didn't hear anyone call his name.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.620
I only know

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.700
he's the leader of the group,

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.020
skinny,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.700
around 1.7 meters tall.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.020
Everyone called him Jiang.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.780
This looks like Jiang Yongquan,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.100
a nationally

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.100
wanted fugitive.
