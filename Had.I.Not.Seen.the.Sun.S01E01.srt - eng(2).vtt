2014

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.538
Here's the money.

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:17.789
Thank you.

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:20.667
Have you had dinner yet?

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.338
Then you have to eat more.

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:27.257
Don't be a picky eater.

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:30.468
BEEF NOODLE SOUP AND ASSORTED SIDE DISHES

00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:34.472
Menu is on the table. Sit.
Order anything you want.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:37.433
I have a customer. Gotta go.

00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.021
Sorry for the wait. Ready to order?

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.609
One large beef noodle soup.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.366
LIN'S EATERY

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.545
CLAIR DE LUNE

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.966
This is a 50-year-old noodle shop.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.385
After last night's rain,
with puddles still around,

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.514
the police cordoned off the area
because of a murder.

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.518
The second-generation owner
was brutally killed.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.605
The police are investigating
any financial motives behind the case.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:09.150
The young owner was reportedly orphaned
and raised by his grandmother.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.819
He later took over her shop
and began supporting her.

00:02:11.903 --> 00:02:15.365
Neighbors say he was a filial child
who was polite and liked by many.

00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:16.991
But sadly, this happened.

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.910
The old lady also lost her grandson.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:22.247
Influencer Chang En-ya, or Lisa,
went missing two weeks ago.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.624
The police had looked for
security footage for days

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.253
but found that some cameras were damaged,

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:29.754
indicating a well-planned act.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.799
The victim, Ti,
was former councilor Ouyang Hsiang's son.

00:02:32.882 --> 00:02:34.008
According to sources,

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:36.678
the police have learned
the suspect's identity.

00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:40.265
The suspect had a dispute with Ouyang Ti
at school seven years ago

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:42.016
and stabbed Ouyang with a knife.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.435
We'll continue to follow this story
and keep you updated.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:48.022
There was a chilling murder
in central Taiwan this afternoon.

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:52.485
A 25-year-old man, Chuang, was dismembered
and dumped in a plastic barrel.

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:55.530
When opened, a decaying,
dismembered body was found.

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:56.614
Terrified, they promptly…

00:02:56.698 --> 00:03:00.201
This family murder
can almost be described as a bloodbath.

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.953
The suspect's methods are cruel.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.122
He continued to bludgeon Wang
even after he died,

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.331
and a young child was…

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:08.543
Serial murders in the past few months
have caused widespread fear.

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:10.169
The murderer has finally been caught.

00:03:10.253 --> 00:03:14.007
Li Jen-yao, dubbed "The Rainstorm Killer"
by the media, is only 25 years old.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.510
He turned himself in to the police
after killing his father yesterday

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:20.388
and confessed to multiple murders.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:51.771
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:21.843
Don't.

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.010
Let me go. I beg you.

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:42.363
2023

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:55.042
It's because I read all these
before falling asleep.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.839
That's why I dreamed of
being hunted down by myself.

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:19.901
Can I call in sick for having a nightmare?

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:51.724
Did you go buy groceries too?

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:53.809
Yeah. Hey, those scallions are expensive.

00:06:53.893 --> 00:06:55.436
Yes, outrageously expensive.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.437
Look, I didn't…

00:06:57.104 --> 00:06:58.105
I think it's her.

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:59.565
I'll go ask.

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:01.317
Hello, miss.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.237
Did you move in on the 18th floor?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.906
Yes, I just moved in last week.

00:07:07.406 --> 00:07:08.950
Sorry I haven't said hi.

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:10.535
It's okay.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:13.329
Did you buy the place or rent it?

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:14.830
Is there anything wrong?

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.624
After moving in,

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:21.420
have you heard heels clacking at night

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:24.674
or your doorbell ringing continuously?

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:26.551
No.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:30.388
You should've asked us longtime residents
first before moving in

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.139
to see if this was a haunted place.

00:07:32.223 --> 00:07:33.766
You wouldn't have been fooled.

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.309
-What?
-That's right.

00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:37.019
You say my place is haunted?

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.773
But… the natural lighting is great inside.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:44.360
A very beautiful young lady
used to live in your apartment.

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:46.862
She was killed on the mountain.

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:49.657
Killed on the mountain?

00:07:51.325 --> 00:07:53.119
But she didn't die in her place.

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:55.288
I don't think it's haunted.

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.040
It's haunted if there are ghosts.

00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:01.294
Back then,
the alley was filled with reporters.

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:03.087
WE FILM PRODUCTIONS

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.673
STIGMATIZED PROPERTY SEARCH

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:11.429
Why redact the addresses?

00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:13.264
How would I know which number it is?

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:16.892
Is my place really haunted?

00:08:20.521 --> 00:08:21.772
Why are you so jumpy?

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.608
Afraid I'd catch you slacking?

00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.900
No.

00:08:24.984 --> 00:08:26.527
I was looking something up.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.196
Come here.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.740
I want to talk to you.

00:08:33.492 --> 00:08:35.494
Hsu Ta-wei will be locked up
for three more days.

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:37.288
How is your death row case going?

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:39.373
If there's no progress,

00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:42.668
I want you to help me with some prep work.

00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:45.046
I got a commercial project, so I need…

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:46.964
What's with that look?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.841
Out with it.

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:55.348
Well, before Ta-wei began isolating,

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:57.767
he asked me to focus on his case.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.270
He specifically told me…
not to let you steal me away.

00:09:03.773 --> 00:09:06.192
You're clearly
an assistant we hired together.

00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:08.402
How come you're
his personal assistant now?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.658
Has Li Jen-yao agreed to meet?

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.493
He kept refusing before, didn't he?

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:18.245
Ta-wei was persistent.

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:21.332
So he asked me
to write a letter to Li Jen-yao.

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:25.544
Ta-wei said I should give it
a more feminine touch.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.797
As if that would work.

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:31.717
But the prison said
Li Jen-yao agreed to meet with me.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:33.219
What?

00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:38.057
Ta-wei.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.395
Listen, come out in 15 minutes.
Bring your equipment. I'll pick you up.

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:45.147
It's only been two days.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:48.526
You can stop isolating now?
Or did you test negative?

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:51.696
It's just a minor cold. Don't be silly.

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:53.364
What's there to isolate?

00:09:54.615 --> 00:09:56.283
Anyway, come out in 15 minutes.

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:58.536
Come on, Ta-wei.

00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:00.579
It might not be as strict now,

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:03.082
but we should still follow the rules.

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:06.001
Who's gonna know if we don't say anything?

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:10.089
Hsu Ta-wei, are you tired of living?

00:10:10.631 --> 00:10:12.216
Do you have a death wish?

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:14.468
Fine. I'll fulfill your wish.

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:16.262
I'll be your assistant today.

00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:19.348
I'll wait for you by the door.
Come get me if you dare.

00:10:24.103 --> 00:10:25.271
Well…

00:10:26.647 --> 00:10:27.648
Yu.

00:10:28.482 --> 00:10:30.443
You heard what I just said, right?

00:10:30.526 --> 00:10:31.694
You go alone this time.

00:10:31.777 --> 00:10:34.739
Explain the process to them clearly.

00:10:34.822 --> 00:10:37.324
Well… I believe in you. You can do it.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:38.242
Good luck.

00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:07.563
Miss.

00:11:08.272 --> 00:11:09.607
Is something wrong?

00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:12.193
No, I'm fine.

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.209
1027, someone's here for you.

00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:30.669
LI JEN-YAO

00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:57.006
Well,

00:12:57.089 --> 00:12:59.758
I'm an employee of We Film Studio.

00:13:00.926 --> 00:13:04.138
Our director is Hsu Ta-wei,

00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:05.556
and--

00:13:19.904 --> 00:13:20.821
Hello.

00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:25.826
Well, I'm an employee of We Film Studio.

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:29.538
Hsu Ta-wei is the director.

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:31.290
I'm the planner.

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:33.292
My name is Chou Pin-yu.

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:34.960
You can call me Yu.

00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.546
As in a fish.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.092
But officially,
it's like the one in Zhou Yu.

00:13:45.054 --> 00:13:46.305
Today, I…

00:13:46.388 --> 00:13:48.891
I want to discuss with you--

00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:53.646
Don't be nervous. I won't hurt you.

00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:55.439
Relax.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:01.028
Sorry.

00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:05.407
I don't usually get nervous so easily.

00:14:06.033 --> 00:14:09.370
I don't know why,
but seeing you gives me a strange feeling.

00:14:10.037 --> 00:14:12.331
Like something oddly familiar.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.209
But we just met.

00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:17.544
What am I talking about?

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:20.130
The point is,

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:22.424
as mentioned in my letter to you,

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:25.886
my company wants to make
a documentary about you.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.224
It may involve details of the crimes.

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.476
Why me?

00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:40.651
Director Hsu is the one who chose you.

00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:43.612
So I don't know why.

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:47.074
But I guess it's because

00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:51.787
the director feels your cases
and story would interest the audience.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.041
Anyway, I hope you'll join our production.

00:15:01.588 --> 00:15:04.383
Is this job important to you?

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:15.811
Okay.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.647
I agree.

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:21.817
You agree?

00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:24.695
You really do?

00:15:27.322 --> 00:15:32.036
But I won't answer
questions I don't want to.

00:15:33.287 --> 00:15:34.872
Of course. We'll fully respect that.

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:40.878
Let me briefly explain the process, then.

00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:45.424
There are three main stages.

00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:48.761
Preproduction, production,

00:15:48.844 --> 00:15:50.220
and postproduction.

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:52.598
You'll just need to know
the production stage

00:15:52.681 --> 00:15:55.517
because that's when we'll shoot.

00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:58.687
And… the main part
is your self-introduction.

00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:00.272
We'll give you some questions

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:04.193
and talk about
what you'll need to answer later.

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:14.495
I think it's about time.

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:16.747
That's all for today.

00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:19.291
Thank you.

00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:25.214
Will you…

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:29.802
come again?

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:34.389
I'll be there next time.

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:42.064
Li Jen-yao.

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:52.866
Why did you agree to this interview?

00:16:53.408 --> 00:16:54.785
Didn't you say no before?

00:16:57.746 --> 00:16:58.622
Disconnected.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:00.624
Did you hear me?

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:39.621
Maybe it's because it's my first time
seeing a death row prisoner up close.

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:44.001
I feel something

00:17:44.793 --> 00:17:46.420
I can't quite put my finger on.

00:17:46.503 --> 00:17:47.921
A death row prisoner?

00:17:48.422 --> 00:17:49.298
Who?

00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:51.675
It's that Li Jen-yao.

00:17:51.758 --> 00:17:54.636
He killed a lot of people a few years ago,
including his father.

00:17:55.262 --> 00:17:56.763
Remember the news about that?

00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:01.018
Of course I do.

00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:03.103
He committed so many crimes.

00:18:03.187 --> 00:18:05.105
It was big news. How could I forget?

00:18:08.692 --> 00:18:12.070
Even though he's in jail now,
he's a dangerous person.

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:14.781
It's probably best to stay away from him.

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.659
At first, I thought he'd be scary too.

00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:19.912
That I'd be too scared to speak.

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:23.498
But

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:26.793
I met him today.

00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:29.630
He doesn't seem

00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.674
as bad as the media claims.

00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:40.891
When I first saw him,

00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:44.186
he didn't look like a murderer to me.

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:51.151
You think he's cute?

00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:52.945
No, I don't.

00:18:53.612 --> 00:18:55.364
Then why do you keep defending him?

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:57.616
Stop talking nonsense.

00:18:57.699 --> 00:18:58.909
Fine.

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:01.912
Are you all moved in?

00:19:02.621 --> 00:19:04.039
Do you need any help?

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.377
I told you I'd help you find a new place,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.920
but you wouldn't let me.

00:19:10.003 --> 00:19:12.381
Great. Now you've got a haunted place.

00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:16.134
Hey, no.

00:19:16.218 --> 00:19:17.719
I told you over and over.

00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:19.763
You are my cousin, not my mom.

00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:22.307
You don't have to do everything for me.

00:19:24.351 --> 00:19:26.561
Auntie doesn't come close
to your micromanaging.

00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:30.399
Also, getting this haunted place
was just an accident.

00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:34.486
Accident? I think
you just wanted the cheapest deal.

00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:36.405
You're renting for less than 10,000 here.

00:19:36.905 --> 00:19:38.699
Didn't you find it weird?

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:41.743
I didn't give it much thought back then.

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:47.040
Based on what your neighbors said,

00:19:47.124 --> 00:19:48.417
she didn't die there.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.294
So the place isn't haunted.

00:19:50.377 --> 00:19:51.586
What are you afraid of?

00:19:53.338 --> 00:19:56.008
-What if she misses home?
-What?

00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:59.720
I'm afraid she'd suddenly miss home
and come back.

00:19:59.803 --> 00:20:01.430
What would I do then?

00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:05.017
I saved this fruit especially for you.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.935
Take them to school. Eat them, okay?

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.645
No need, ma'am. No, thanks.

00:20:09.146 --> 00:20:11.148
Excuse us.

00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:13.900
Do you sell here too?

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.239
Oh yeah, we're selling here these days.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.326
Come to our fruit stall if you have time.

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.870
These are really sweet.
I handpicked all of them.

00:20:24.953 --> 00:20:26.121
Take them.

00:20:26.204 --> 00:20:27.205
That's enough.

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:31.418
Sorry, my wife just feels
a connection with you.

00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:32.669
She means no harm.

00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:33.712
I'm sorry.

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:35.672
Let's go.

00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:37.215
Don't be late for school.

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:45.349
Let's go.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:48.477
Sis, do you remember them?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.272
I met them right outside your place
and Ta-wei's studio before.

00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:53.398
Now,

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.027
they seem to know wherever I go.

00:20:58.445 --> 00:21:02.616
And the wife seems to mistake me
for someone else every time.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.409
It's weird.

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:07.412
Aren't you overthinking?

00:21:07.496 --> 00:21:11.083
It's normal for fruit sellers
to go around Taipei with their stalls.

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.793
It's probably just a coincidence.

00:21:14.378 --> 00:21:15.212
Let's go.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.442
How did you find this place?

00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:41.988
How many times are you gonna ask?
I told you I found it on the Internet.

00:21:42.656 --> 00:21:46.076
Miss Chou,
a deliveryman dropped this off for you.

00:21:46.159 --> 00:21:48.036
I didn't order anything.

00:21:57.963 --> 00:21:59.464
Who sent it?

00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:01.550
It's Chi-chi.

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:03.635
She knows I moved,
so she's giving me this.

00:22:20.444 --> 00:22:21.778
Don't scare me.

00:22:22.362 --> 00:22:23.572
What did you see?

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:26.825
Is there really a ghost?

00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:30.162
Even a ghost would leave
if it saw this mess.

00:22:32.122 --> 00:22:34.124
How long have you been living here?

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.334
Why are your things still in boxes?

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:38.503
And what's up with these socks?

00:22:42.174 --> 00:22:45.010
Is the laundry on the bed clean or dirty?

00:22:45.552 --> 00:22:46.428
Where do you sleep?

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.223
Just… over there.

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:52.767
No way.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.938
I don't think you're fit to live alone.
You'd better move back in with me.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:02.110
We'll talk about that later. Take a seat.

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:03.987
Here.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.572
I'm giving Chi-chi a call.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.331
Hello, Chi-chi.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.249
I received your gift.

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:17.709
Thank you.

00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:20.545
Hey, how could you not invite me
when you were moving?

00:23:21.296 --> 00:23:22.380
How's it going?

00:23:22.464 --> 00:23:23.423
Not bad.

00:23:23.924 --> 00:23:25.342
Things are going well.

00:23:25.425 --> 00:23:27.969
As if! You sound weird.

00:23:28.053 --> 00:23:30.639
Hey, I'm your gal pal.

00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:34.434
How could you keep secrets from me?
You should tell me everything.

00:23:34.935 --> 00:23:37.187
Are you gonna tell me or not?
Are you? Are you?!

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.773
Come on! Or I'm coming straight over!

00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:41.024
It's really nothing.

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:42.442
Don't worry.

00:23:42.526 --> 00:23:44.152
We'll chat over dinner sometime.

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:45.153
Jeez…

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:46.821
Okay, talk later. Bye.

00:23:50.867 --> 00:23:52.410
Hey, don't tidy up.

00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:54.120
I'll do it myself.

00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:57.999
You're making it seem like
I only asked you here to clean.

00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.668
I'd feel bad.

00:24:00.627 --> 00:24:01.461
It's fine.

00:24:02.045 --> 00:24:04.839
I used to do your laundry anyway.

00:24:04.923 --> 00:24:07.259
Okay, just take a seat.

00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:27.487
Did I put my phone in this bag?

00:24:31.241 --> 00:24:32.284
Ta-wei.

00:24:34.786 --> 00:24:36.121
Okay, one second.

00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:37.205
Go ahead.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.792
Interview with Li Jen-yao next week.

00:24:41.543 --> 00:24:44.379
Okay, I'll call you
when I finish organizing the info.

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:46.089
Okay, bye.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.323
FIRST MEETING WITH LI JEN-YAO

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.019
Is it raining?

00:27:35.508 --> 00:27:37.260
Hsiao-tung, are you there?

00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:39.971
Can you hear me?

00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:42.974
You hear my voice?

00:27:44.934 --> 00:27:47.312
Can you please wake up?

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:53.359
What's wrong?

00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:56.821
Why did you wake up suddenly?

00:27:57.739 --> 00:27:59.240
I'm fine.

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:07.874
Wake up.

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:11.169
Why did I have such a weird dream?

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:29.020
Pin-yu.

00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:30.688
Are you okay?

00:28:33.316 --> 00:28:34.901
I'm fine.

00:28:34.984 --> 00:28:36.528
I'm just using the bathroom.

00:28:57.882 --> 00:29:00.009
-Sis!
-What's wrong?

00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:04.472
I just saw another girl in the mirror.

00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:09.185
Are you too tired
to recognize yourself in the mirror?

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:10.937
Why would I not recognize myself?

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.147
Go and take a look. It's scary.

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:52.604
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:29:52.687 --> 00:29:54.188
What do you want?

00:29:54.939 --> 00:29:57.066
I didn't say I'd move out.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.987
I just want to know
what happened in this place.

00:30:01.487 --> 00:30:03.448
Why else would rent be so cheap?

00:30:04.157 --> 00:30:05.366
Let me tell you,

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.827
don't put the blame on my property

00:30:07.911 --> 00:30:10.413
when you're the one
who catches something dirty outside.

00:30:10.496 --> 00:30:12.790
If you wanna move out, fine.
It's up to you.

00:30:12.874 --> 00:30:16.002
But don't expect me
to return your deposit.

00:30:21.382 --> 00:30:22.550
Hurry up!

00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:24.302
Sorry.

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:29.599
First day and you're already moving slowly
and chatting on your phone?

00:30:31.225 --> 00:30:33.645
Okay. We're ready. Let's get started.

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.065
I did some research beforehand.

00:30:37.148 --> 00:30:39.901
I saw your photos from high school.

00:30:40.568 --> 00:30:42.320
Honestly, you were quite handsome.

00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:45.156
I bet a lot of girls liked you.

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:46.115
Well,

00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:49.452
could you tell us about
your time in high school?

00:30:49.535 --> 00:30:54.791
Anything profound or unforgettable
that you can share with us?

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.839
What about friends?

00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:05.843
You know, we make friends as students.

00:31:06.469 --> 00:31:07.887
Did you have any good friends…

00:31:12.934 --> 00:31:15.103
No. I had no friends.

00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:16.604
Really?

00:31:17.897 --> 00:31:19.273
What about Ouyang Ti?

00:31:22.777 --> 00:31:24.070
He wasn't your friend?

00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:33.454
Let me see.

00:31:36.124 --> 00:31:37.291
Ouyang Ti.

00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:40.086
Chen Che-li.

00:31:41.546 --> 00:31:42.797
Chuang Jung-tai.

00:31:43.673 --> 00:31:45.049
Wang Yu-hsiang.

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:46.759
Fan Wei-ting.

00:31:48.886 --> 00:31:50.138
Lin Meng-hung.

00:31:55.018 --> 00:31:58.187
There was also a pretty girl.
What was her name?

00:31:59.647 --> 00:32:00.773
This one.

00:32:02.066 --> 00:32:03.317
Chang En-ya.

00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:08.281
All of them

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:10.408
were killed by you.

00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:13.661
How come they all went
to the same school as you?

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:17.123
If you said
nothing happened in high school,

00:32:17.206 --> 00:32:18.499
no one would believe it.

00:32:18.583 --> 00:32:22.336
Why not take this opportunity to tell us

00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:27.884
what exactly happened
between you and these people in the past?

00:32:58.414 --> 00:32:59.415
Yu.

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.501
You take over.

00:33:02.085 --> 00:33:05.922
-Me?
-Was I talking to a wall?

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:07.131
Come on.

00:33:07.215 --> 00:33:09.801
You ask the questions. You can do it.

00:33:09.884 --> 00:33:12.261
Go ahead when you're ready, okay?

00:33:13.513 --> 00:33:16.265
I will continue
with the director's questions, then.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:22.522
What happened in 2007?

00:33:23.272 --> 00:33:27.735
Based on the information available,
you stabbed Ouyang Ti in 2007.

00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:33.032
Can you tell us

00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:35.868
if there was any conflict between you?

00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:06.357
We want to know
why you committed these crimes,

00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:08.234
not from a legal perspective,

00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:11.571
but because the victims' families
deserve to know

00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:14.991
what they lost their loved ones for.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.167
Rainy days.

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:33.676
Because I hate rainy days.

00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:43.186
Ta-wei, are you okay?

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:46.189
This is your car.

00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:50.568
He hates rainy days.
What bullshit reason is that?

00:34:51.152 --> 00:34:52.737
He hates rainy days,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.614
so he killed ten people?

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.701
Honestly,

00:34:58.784 --> 00:35:02.914
I'd rather he'd tried to fool us
with some random excuse, you know?

00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:06.500
But you saw his expression just now.

00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:08.794
He was serious.

00:35:11.339 --> 00:35:14.592
Ta-wei, why do you want to make
this documentary?

00:35:22.683 --> 00:35:23.684
What do you think?

00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:26.687
What do I think?

00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:30.608
It's because…

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:37.156
because he's currently considered
the most infamous serial killer.

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:41.035
So if you can get him
to talk about his motive

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:43.663
for the first time on camera,

00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:47.416
maybe the documentary
will make you a famous director overnight.

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:54.382
You're right.

00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:56.300
It makes sense.

00:35:56.384 --> 00:36:00.513
At least it's more logical
than fucking rainy days.

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:03.140
Right.

00:36:03.224 --> 00:36:07.603
I, Hsu Ta-wei, am willing
to film this serial killer

00:36:08.104 --> 00:36:10.064
because I want to be fucking famous.

00:36:20.741 --> 00:36:22.493
Look at that! It's raining.

00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:25.162
Annoying.

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.724
USELESS, TRASH, IMBECILE, CURSED

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:07.723
-You are back.
-Hey.

00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:09.225
It's pouring with rain outside.

00:38:09.308 --> 00:38:10.559
It's all right.

00:38:10.643 --> 00:38:12.520
Go get changed and come eat.

00:38:12.603 --> 00:38:13.437
Okay.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.946
Aren't you gonna change?
Where are you heading?

00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:26.158
I bought Wen-ling's favorite cake
on my way back.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.953
Okay, hurry up, then.

00:38:51.016 --> 00:38:52.810
-Ta-wei.
-What?

00:38:53.477 --> 00:38:54.311
It's so late.

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:56.939
What are we here for? Why not the office?

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.067
This is our chance. How can we let it go?

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:01.652
What do you mean?

00:39:03.028 --> 00:39:05.156
Didn't our male lead say today
that he killed people

00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:06.907
because he hates rainy days?

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:08.742
It's raining now.

00:39:09.368 --> 00:39:11.495
We can get some aerial footage

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:16.083
to use as background in the documentary.
Isn't that great?

00:39:16.584 --> 00:39:18.461
If we don't shoot it now, when will we?

00:39:18.544 --> 00:39:21.172
When we get a rain truck?
Do we have the money for that?

00:39:58.959 --> 00:39:59.919
It's a deal, then.

00:40:00.002 --> 00:40:02.213
The three of us will come here again.

00:40:02.296 --> 00:40:05.758
Sure, the three of us
will come here again.

00:40:05.841 --> 00:40:07.301
We'll come earlier next time.

00:40:42.795 --> 00:40:43.921
Chou Pin-yu.

00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:46.715
Carry the umbrella for me.

00:40:52.263 --> 00:40:54.640
There's a girl in the rain over there.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.522
A girl? Where?

00:41:40.477 --> 00:41:41.979
Don't come any closer.

00:41:42.062 --> 00:41:43.272
What do you want?

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:45.274
It wasn't my fault.

00:41:45.357 --> 00:41:46.859
Don't come any closer.

00:41:46.942 --> 00:41:48.694
It wasn't my fault.

00:41:53.907 --> 00:41:56.619
Don't come any closer!

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:03.667
Don't come any closer!

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:16.347
The eggs weren't out yet,
and over 20 people were already waiting.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.974
The supermarket started selling
imported eggs today, too,

00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:20.351
washed and graded in the US.

00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:23.270
But within ten minutes, they were already…

00:42:25.856 --> 00:42:28.692
Hsiao-tung. .

00:42:29.735 --> 00:42:31.195
I'm back.

00:42:35.032 --> 00:42:36.116
Hsiao-tung.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.951
Have you had dinner yet?

00:42:38.744 --> 00:42:40.579
If not, I'll cook for you.

00:43:52.943 --> 00:43:53.986
Chou Pin-yu.

00:43:54.486 --> 00:43:55.863
Carry the umbrella for me.

00:43:57.072 --> 00:43:59.575
There's a girl in the rain over there.

00:43:59.658 --> 00:44:00.492
A girl?

00:44:01.368 --> 00:44:02.369
Where?

00:44:21.138 --> 00:44:22.181
Hey, sis.

00:44:22.681 --> 00:44:23.682
Listen.

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:27.895
I think I saw that girl again tonight.

00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:35.694
Are you looking for me?

00:52:06.937 --> 00:52:10.523
