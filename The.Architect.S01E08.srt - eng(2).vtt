Your Lordship.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.400
Xi Yan always moves between

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.759
you and Young Lord Xiao,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.230
and her attitude towards
the Shen family matters is ambiguous.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.590
Feigning obedience
while secretly defying.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.480
Highly suspicious.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.679
I believe

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.280
this woman must not be kept any longer.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.100
She will sooner or later bring disaster.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.719
When she wakes up,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.199
interrogate her strictly.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.719

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.560
Wishing to speak across the distant sky.

Beauty amidst the colorful clouds.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.280
Wishing to speak across the distant sky.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.200
Longing with no way to meet.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.960
Gazing sadly at the cool breeze ahead.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.079
This is a poem I wrote.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.439
If we can meet again,

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.719
we will surely recognize each other
through this secret message.

No matter the cost,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.799
I want her alive.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.799

Your Lordship.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.560
If I were born into a prestigious family
like Shen Changning,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.560
would you still be so frivolous with me?

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.840
(So you are Shen Changning.)

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.039
(Alas, fate is cruel.)

exterminated the entire Shen clan,)

Awake?

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.439
Your Lordship.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.960
This time I acted rashly
out of impatience,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.680
wanting to investigate the Shen case.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.500
No need to explain.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.319
I understand.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.199
You want to avenge Shen Changning

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:21.680
for the Shen family.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.800
Why did the you also appear
at the Shen Residence's annex?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.240
I am the chief judge for the Shen case.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.919
After found a new clue,
of course I must investigate to the end.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.280
Just don't know

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.759
whether you want to clear the injustice

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.199
or covets the Shen family treasure?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.620
Naturally, to clear
the Shen family's name,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.200
and return justice to the Shen family.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.039
Whether you believe it or not.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.759
Regarding the Shen case,

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.199
I am always on your side.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.879
Your Lordship, I'll remember

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.920
your words today.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.439
If you find the enemy,

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.240
what would you do?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.319
Wash the hatred with blood.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.199
Repay injustice with life.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.399
With your skills,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.079
even if facing the enemy directly,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.290
it's hard to protect yourself.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.771
I can't always appear in time.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.800
I don't understand
what you mean by this.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.160
I've been free recently,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.240

Your Lordship.

Consort Shu is in trouble.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:43.800
Let's go.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.399
Your Majesty.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.920
The Empress Dowager fell ill after seeing
some fallen flowers.

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:55.959
She believes

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.160
that it alludes to the decline
of Daliang,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.990
and demands severe punishment
for Consort Shu.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.990
Flowers bloom and fall,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.839
that is the law of nature.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.040
How could one possibly
place the blame on Consort Shu?

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.170
Your Majesty need not trouble yourself.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.600
It was I, who failed
to supervise properly.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.500
I am willing to accept punishment.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.000
Your Majesty.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.200
If my elder sister is at fault,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.890
I am willing to take the punishment
in her stead.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.160
No.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.390
How could I let my younger brother
suffer for me?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.120
Very well.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.440
For the sake of your sibling bond,
you shall take the thirty lashes

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.200
on behalf of Consort Shu.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.919
Your Majesty.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.320
My beloved.

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:43.039
Mr. Pei

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:44.600
comes from the military.

00:08:44.812 --> 00:08:45.639
His character

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.825
is upright and impulsive.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.250
I valued him so highly

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:52.879
that I even granted Wan'er
to him in marriage.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.525
And what did he do?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.200
He caused Wan'er to fall gravely ill,

00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:00.440
disregarding the dignity
of the royal family.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:05.000
This time, let the two offenses
be punished together,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.799
a light punishment as a warning.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.600
These blows

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.559
are not to Pei Governor's body,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.000
but to his honor.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.720
Yu.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.960
Your suffering in court

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.799
is all because of me.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.919
From now on, matters of the harem

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.480
shall be handled by me.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.960
Sister.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.950
Do not blame yourself.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.960
This act

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.879
was directed at me all along.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.639
Alright, Your Lordship.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.360
Your Lordship.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:01.279
This is too much.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.080
You have defended the borders

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.399
and accomplished countless feats,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.559
and cleaned up many messes for others.

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.840
How can you endure such humiliation?

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.039
Receiving my salary,
and worrying for the state.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.240
This is my duty.

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.120
Yet I cannot bear

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:17.399
that you carry so much blame.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.279
No matter how the world slanders me,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.000
defames me,

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.759
it cannot harm me in the slightest.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.360
To me,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.879
it is inconsequential.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.360
And the Shen family?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.399
Shen...

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.960
What about Miss Xi Yan?

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.700
There's no way you don't care about her.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:00.600
To seek the truth,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.559
every step is perilous.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.320
What you must first learn

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.919
is the art of hidden weapons.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.600
But for a beginner,

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:13.159
shouldn't self-defense come first?

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.159
Only by understanding

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:16.100
can one defend against it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.639
See?

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:33.759
Showing weakness to the enemy
can still lure them in.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.759
This move

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.000
would only fool me.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.639
If it can fool you,

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.600
I can win.

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:49.279
Using oneself as bait,

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.759
drawing others into the trap,

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.960
piercing oneself

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.600
also pierces the enemy.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.200
It's snowing.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.919
In previous years, what did you do
when it snowed?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.440
Of course, I ate the tangerines
my father gave me.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.250
Every year, my father and I...

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.600
All these are old memories.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.159
It's not interesting to talk about.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.759
Mr. Pei.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.240
The punishment I gave you a few days ago

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.159
was a bit severe.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.679
Today,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.590
I specially arranged a banquet at home.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.279
Speak.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.000
What compensation do you want?

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.559
Your Majesty,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.000
the thunder and rain,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
all are your grace.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.120
I have recently obtained new clues

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.360
and wish to ask Your Majesty

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:03.480
to allow me to re-investigate
an old case.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:06.960
What clues?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.600
Which old case?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.331
I discovered that the head
of the Shen clan

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:12.740
colluded with foreigners
through secret letters.

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:14.519
Compared with the usual documents,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.220
the handwriting looks similar,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.080
but it was not written
by the same person.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:20.879
So do you think the Ministry of Justice
made a mistake,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.559
or

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:23.720
I passed the wrong judgment?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.039
I dare not say.

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:32.559
The Shen family case has long been
sealed by the Ministry of Justice,

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.679
and it is a closed case.

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:35.919
Just because a few characters
differ in handwriting,

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.720
you recklessly reopen the case?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.720
Where is the law of the state?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.960
Where is the dignity of the court?

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.200
Wait until you have ironclad evidence,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.519
then submit a memorial to me.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:50.240
Yu.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.639
His Majesty has already spoken.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.679
You should thank him.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.399
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.600
I,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.559
will do my utmost
and not fail Your Majesty's grace.

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:07.240
I

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.600
am a bit tired.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.480
Today,

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.840
let's end here.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.399
Yu, you've had too much to drink.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:31.720
I'll take you back home.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.960
Miss, this was specially prepared for you

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.500
before the Governor entered the palace.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.799
Miss,

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.440
I see that the Governor

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:04.960
cares for you in every way.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.600
Could he really be in love with you?

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:09.080
Do not

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.399
be deceived by false affection.

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:11.720
A tangerine

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.200
tastes just right when

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.960
it's 40 percent sour
and 60 percent sweet.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:17.080
As for feelings,

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.519
just two percent is enough to make reality
and pretense indistinguishable.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.590
Your Lordship, you're back.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.559
Your Lordship.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.480
Help me.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.279
You lowly maid!

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.850
(End of Episode)

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.559
She can put effort into deceiving me,
and not other men,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:05.919
that's enough.
