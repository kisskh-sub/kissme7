00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:31.886
Don't bother going in.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.304
You should leave.

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.600
Please let me just take a look at her.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:39.769
-Please--
-You don't deserve that.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.235
What did I tell you that day?

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:50.738
What did you promise me?

00:00:52.198 --> 00:00:54.033
You didn't take good care of her.

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:58.913
You even upset her so much
she's in the hospital with cuts all over.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:01.166
How could I possibly let you see her?

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:08.923
We are tired.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:11.843
We are really tired.

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.513
Please just let us be, okay?

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:54.427
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

THANK YOU, HSIANG'S MEDICAL DEVICES LTD.

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:15.198
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:46.080
HAD I NOT SEEN THE SUN

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.168
You're doodling? Hurry up and study.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.843
Kuo Hsuan-jung.

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:00.470
If you won't study,

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:02.722
then go clean up the gym.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.223
Sort the equipment.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.569
It's all right. Keep reading.

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.166
Why did you lock the door?

00:04:36.422 --> 00:04:37.256
What?

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.676
Are you scared?

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.846
Weren't you cocky
in the classroom earlier?

00:04:47.058 --> 00:04:50.395
Sir, what have I done
to make you hate me so much?

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.564
Haven't I made myself clear?

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.150
Your grades suck. Your family is a mess.

00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:57.402
You're trash.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:00.113
You won't be able to find a good job.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.949
Why bother staying in school?

00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:04.909
You just give me so much trouble.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:08.413
Wouldn't it be easier if you dropped out?

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:10.665
You don't want to study anyway.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:17.338
Fuck. What's with that look?

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:21.551
You have two days.
Withdraw yourself by then.

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:23.428
Don't push me.

00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:30.244
Jen-yao, how come you're so thin?

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:32.079
Have you not been eating enough?

00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:34.749
Are you getting three meals a day
and eating well?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.293
-Mom, have a seat.
-Okay.

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:40.046
Hey, Jen-yao, listen,
this is chicken soup.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.215
I made it with fresh free-range chicken

00:06:42.298 --> 00:06:44.008
and Chinese medicinal herbs.

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.052
It'll help you recharge. It's best hot.

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:47.678
Just leave it here.

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:48.804
I'll have it later.

00:06:49.305 --> 00:06:50.139
Okay.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.184
Why the sudden visit?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.145
You haven't called in a long time.

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.814
I thought I'd come by
to see how you are doing.

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:00.691
How are you?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.736
I'm doing great.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:05.279
And you?

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:06.989
Me too.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.825
Don't worry about
sending me money every month.

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.244
I am working.

00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:12.787
Save it for yourself.

00:07:14.664 --> 00:07:15.498
Okay.

00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:21.337
You're on your own in Taipei.
Are you dating anyone?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.173
If a girl were here to keep you company

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:25.633
and take care of you,

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:27.260
I wouldn't worry as much.

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:29.387
If there is,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.555
please tell me.

00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:33.641
We're not looking for
someone from a great family.

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:36.936
All that matters is
that she's decent and treats you well.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.855
Mom,

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.775
you came all the way to Taipei
just to say that?

00:07:50.283 --> 00:07:53.661
Well, your dad came to see me
a few days ago.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.545
It feels like he has changed a lot lately.

00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:04.422
He's been going to work.

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:05.715
His income is steady.

00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.967
And he doesn't gamble anymore.

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.180
I have work later.

00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:17.810
Do you want to stay here,
or shall I take you to the bus?

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:25.651
Go do your thing.
It's okay. I can leave on my own.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.232
Jen-yao.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.778
I'm really happy I saw you today

00:09:09.695 --> 00:09:12.073
and got to see
that you are starting fresh.

00:09:13.616 --> 00:09:15.159
I know it's difficult…

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:19.872
but I'm proud

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:21.916
to see you move on.

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:29.090
Okay, no need to see me off. I'll be fine.

00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:30.883
Take care.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:54.949
Good morning.

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:56.575
Good morning, sir.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:02.456
Good morning.

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:11.674
-Morning, Ms. Kao.
-Mr. Chuang.

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:14.009
The principal wants to see you now.

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:18.180
Ma'am.

00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:25.104
Jung-tai.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.565
Have you seen that leak online?

00:10:28.232 --> 00:10:29.066
What?

00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:34.989
Your grades suck. Your family is a mess.

00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:36.699
You're trash.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.535
You won't be able to find a good job.

00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:42.037
Why bother staying in school?

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:43.706
You just give me so much trouble.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:45.458
Fuck. What's with the look?

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.792
What's with the pretense?

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:50.629
This video was posted yesterday.

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:52.715
More revelations came out later.

00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:56.886
Kuo Hsuan-jung reported us to
the Education Ministry, but was ignored.

00:10:58.387 --> 00:11:00.347
The higher-ups now know about this

00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:01.766
and are investigating.

00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:05.269
Ma'am.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:07.605
This was clearly filmed in secret.

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:10.399
She set me up.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:12.568
I can bring her here.

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:14.695
I can make her clear this up.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.697
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:18.908
This thing has blown up.

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.493
If you went to Kuo Hsuan-jung,

00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:23.829
people would think that we pressured her

00:11:23.913 --> 00:11:25.206
into making us look good.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.166
I did yell at Kuo Hsuan-jung,

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:29.460
but that was only because
she was problematic.

00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:31.670
She has no desire to study

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:33.964
and is bringing down
class grades and morale.

00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:36.342
As a responsible teacher,

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:38.552
I disciplined and guided her.

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.054
Was that wrong?

00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:44.809
Whether you're a good teacher or not
is completely irrelevant.

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:50.439
What matters now is
that our school and I are in deep trouble!

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.068
The higher-ups
are reopening the investigation.

00:11:54.652 --> 00:11:58.572
You've really hurt
our school's reputation,

00:11:58.656 --> 00:11:59.865
future enrollment,

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:00.991
and subsidies.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.576
Do you understand?

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.121
Please, ma'am. I can--

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:07.790
All right, enough.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.126
I've already given you a chance.

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:13.003
When I first hired you,

00:12:13.087 --> 00:12:14.880
I was under a lot of pressure.

00:12:15.381 --> 00:12:17.216
Besides, seven years ago,

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:19.593
when you, Ouyang Ti,
and the others messed up,

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:21.095
who cleaned it up for you?

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:24.723
If these things were to get out,

00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:27.810
I doubt any school would hire you.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.283
You deserve to rot
more than anyone else, you know?

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.785
If it hadn't been for you,

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:30.456
Hsiao-tung wouldn't have been raped
by those scumbags.

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:32.625
She suffered so much because of you.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:33.792
And you?

00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:36.712
What did you do?

00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:38.672
Nothing at all!

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.549
Nothing at all.

00:13:58.067 --> 00:13:59.526
It's all your fault.

00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:04.615
If they hadn't met you,
they wouldn't have suffered.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:06.575
It's all your fault.

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:07.910
It's all your fault.

00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:11.622
If they hadn't met you,

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:14.792
they wouldn't have suffered.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.421
It's all your fault.

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:22.132
It's all your fault.

00:14:23.884 --> 00:14:27.012
It's all your fault.

00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:29.473
Everything is your fault.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.685
It's all your fault.

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.104
She suffered so much because of you.

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:36.397
Why don't you rot in hell?

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.564
And you?

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:39.066
It's all your fault.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.402
What did you do? Everything is your fault.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.822
Nothing at all. It's your fault.

00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:47.658
You deserve to rot more than anyone else.

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.493
It's all your fault.

00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:51.328
It's all your fault.

00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:54.248
What did you do? You deserve to rot.

00:14:54.331 --> 00:14:55.874
If it hadn't been for you…

00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:00.462
You deserve to rot more than anyone else.

00:15:00.546 --> 00:15:01.547
It's all your fault.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.923
Everything is your fault.

00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:04.216
It's all your fault.

00:15:04.883 --> 00:15:06.135
Have you ever wondered

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:10.139
why I ended up like this?

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:16.562
How can all of you go on living

00:15:17.062 --> 00:15:18.689
like nothing ever happened?

00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:22.735
You can all move on.

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:26.113
How come I'm the only one

00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:29.366
who's stuck in that day forever?

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:42.963
I got to see that you are starting fresh.

00:15:43.797 --> 00:15:45.799
I'm proud

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.302
to see you move on.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.473
To see you move on.

00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:53.599
TOGETHER WE MOVE FORWARD

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:56.351
To see you move on.

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:58.395
Move on.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:01.440
Move on.

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:03.901
You can all move on.

00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:07.321
How come I'm the only one

00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:10.324
who's stuck in that day forever?

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:19.726
HONEY

00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.368
How can someone so lousy become a teacher?

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:38.704
ANONYMOUS:
SHOULD A SCUMBAG LIKE THIS BE A TEACHER?

00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:39.913
-Fuck.
-You're scared?

00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:41.957
I was wondering
how she could screw me over.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.834
Apparently, someone helped her.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.294
…pin a few things on you.

00:17:46.003 --> 00:17:48.964
When the school asks your grandma
to withdraw you from school,

00:17:49.798 --> 00:17:50.674
we'll see who's cocky.

00:17:55.429 --> 00:17:56.889
-Hello?
-You piece of trash.

00:17:56.972 --> 00:17:59.099
You like bullying women
and older folks, huh?

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:00.434
You better not run into me.

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:01.977
Who are you--

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:05.647
What the fuck?

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:10.986
Fuck. What the hell?

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.489
CHUANG JUNG-TAI, DOXED
EVEN TEACHERS HATE HIM

00:18:14.573 --> 00:18:15.699
Fuck.

00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:32.341
Again.

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:33.425
-Blow him up.
-Come on.

00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:34.885
-Hurry up!
-It won't light.

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:35.802
One more.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.346
-Here.
-Again! One more!

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:39.139
Fuck! What the hell are you doing?

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:40.641
Come down!

00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:41.725
I dare you!

00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:42.851
-Coward!
-Come down.

00:18:42.935 --> 00:18:44.019
-Hurry.
-Don't you run!

00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:46.480
-Stay!
-He's here!

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.191
What are you doing?
Which class are you in?

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:51.109
Fuck!

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:00.827
DISGUSTING, SCUMBAG, SON OF A BITCH

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:02.829
GO TO HELL, SCUMBAG, TRASH

00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:08.710
FUCK, ASSHOLE,
LOWLIFE, BASTARD, ROT IN HELL

00:19:23.183 --> 00:19:26.561
Let me go!

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:29.815
Let me go!

00:19:30.732 --> 00:19:31.608
Let me go!

00:19:58.176 --> 00:19:59.553
Li Jen-yao!

00:20:01.346 --> 00:20:02.222
Let me go!

00:20:03.974 --> 00:20:05.183
Li Jen-yao!

00:20:05.267 --> 00:20:07.769
Let me go!

00:20:18.113 --> 00:20:19.656
Li Jen-yao!

00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:22.367
What do you want?

00:20:22.993 --> 00:20:25.203
Didn't I tell you already?

00:20:25.287 --> 00:20:28.290
I only did those things
because Ouyang and the others forced me!

00:20:29.124 --> 00:20:31.001
What do you want?

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:33.420
I swear I won't go to
Chiang Hsiao-tung again!

00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:35.630
Li Jen-yao!

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.299
Don't do this.

00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:38.175
PARAQUAT

00:20:39.134 --> 00:20:40.469
Wait, don't do this.

00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:41.803
Li Jen-yao.

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.847
Li Jen-yao, wait.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:45.891
I swear.

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:47.851
I swear.

00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:50.020
I'll never show my face around her again.

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.064
Li Jen-yao, let me go.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:54.483
My daughter will be born soon.

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:56.193
Wait.

00:20:57.277 --> 00:20:58.570
Let me go.

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:02.866
No!

00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:20.967
Give me another chance.

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.387
Give me another chance.

00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:27.557
When Chiang Hsiao-tung
begged you guys to stop,

00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:30.852
did you give her a chance?!

00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:25.949
I don't want this.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.952
I don't want to die. I can't die yet.

00:22:29.035 --> 00:22:30.328
I can't die.

00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:39.171
Li Jen-yao.

00:22:39.796 --> 00:22:41.006
Li Jen-yao.

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.134
Save me.

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:45.969
Fuck, it hurts.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.679
It hurts.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.556
Li Jen-yao.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:51.808
Li Jen-yao.

00:22:56.855 --> 00:22:58.482
FAVORITE TRACKS

00:22:58.565 --> 00:23:01.193
DEBUSSY, CLAIR DE LUNE

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:05.989
I wasn't the one who did anything wrong.

00:23:06.072 --> 00:23:09.034
Why am I being killed?

00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:14.164
I'm sorry.

00:23:17.709 --> 00:23:18.585
Sor--

00:26:58.638 --> 00:26:59.556
MESSAGES, HSUAN

00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:03.727
My teacher told me today that the school
had decided to fire Chuang Jung-tai.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.146
They told me to stay in school
and not worry.

00:27:06.646 --> 00:27:08.022
Thank you so much.

00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:09.607
Without your help,

00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:11.776
I wouldn't have had a chance to graduate.

00:27:12.402 --> 00:27:14.279
YOU CAN DO IT

00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:21.703
HSUAN: CAN WE MEET?

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:47.896
Jen-yao, you're here.

00:28:05.497 --> 00:28:06.414
You took him back?

00:28:07.832 --> 00:28:08.792
No.

00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:10.126
How could I?

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.421
I won't take him back
until you forgive him.

00:28:14.798 --> 00:28:16.382
Come in and have a seat, yeah?

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:17.801
Come.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.062
I bought this cake on my way here.

00:28:29.145 --> 00:28:31.940
I heard the shop is famous. Take it.

00:28:35.777 --> 00:28:37.862
I've got something to do. Gotta go.

00:28:38.947 --> 00:28:40.406
I'll come see you another time.

00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:51.334
You're really making it tough for me.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.421
I hid from debt collectors,
and now I hide from my son.

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.555
Do you have to put it like that?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.683
He just can't accept you right now.

00:29:08.017 --> 00:29:09.394
One day,

00:29:10.728 --> 00:29:12.647
he will believe

00:29:13.523 --> 00:29:14.732
that you've changed.

00:29:15.692 --> 00:29:17.193
When that happens,

00:29:18.403 --> 00:29:19.737
I'm sure

00:29:20.238 --> 00:29:22.407
our family can be together again

00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:24.200
like we used to be.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:04.824
Hsuan.

00:30:08.286 --> 00:30:09.370
Hsuan.

00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:24.052
Where is Hsuan?

00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:27.347
Wait a minute.

00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:30.058
I'm not wrong, am I?

00:30:30.558 --> 00:30:32.477
Weren't you our class leader,
Lai Yun-chen?

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:38.358
Answer me first.

00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:40.360
Where is Hsuan?

00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:44.989
She's fine. She couldn't be better.

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:47.367
That brat isn't worth all your care.

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:50.119
After everything you did for her,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.038
I just made a few threats,

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.290
and she sold you out.

00:30:54.374 --> 00:30:56.501
We were just partners.

00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:59.128
As long as we ruined you,

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:02.173
who cares who betrayed whom.

00:31:03.424 --> 00:31:04.759
Why did you do this?

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.844
What did I ever do to you?

00:31:06.928 --> 00:31:10.139
You know very well
what you guys did to Hsiao-tung.

00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:12.225
Fucking hell, what's wrong with you all?

00:31:12.308 --> 00:31:14.310
That was so long ago.

00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:16.104
Why can't you let me be?

00:31:16.187 --> 00:31:18.189
Plus, we fucked
Chiang Hsiao-tung, not you.

00:31:18.272 --> 00:31:20.024
Why are you messing with me?

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:26.489
Fuck.

00:31:52.807 --> 00:31:53.641
Li Jen-yao!

00:31:53.725 --> 00:31:55.518
Motherfucker! What are you doing?

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:15.455
Fuck.

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:16.622
What do you want?

00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:18.374
What do you want? You're nuts!

00:32:21.002 --> 00:32:22.086
Fuck!

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:27.091
Motherfucker, what are you doing?

00:32:27.175 --> 00:32:28.051
What the hell?

00:32:28.634 --> 00:32:29.552
You're nuts!

00:32:29.635 --> 00:32:31.220
Go away!

00:32:36.934 --> 00:32:37.769
Fuck!

00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:40.313
Wait.

00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:41.230
Li Jen-yao.

00:32:42.857 --> 00:32:43.983
I'm sorry.

00:32:45.443 --> 00:32:46.569
I was wrong.

00:32:47.445 --> 00:32:49.113
Spare me, okay?

00:32:49.614 --> 00:32:50.907
I beg you.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:55.244
No!

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:10.176
I'm sorry. Spare me.

00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:35.219
Are you okay?

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:46.272
Aren't we going to see Hsiao-tung?

00:35:25.144 --> 00:35:26.270
Mr. Chiang.

00:35:27.188 --> 00:35:28.439
It's been a while.

00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:32.193
Hello, Mrs. Chiang.

00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:34.153
I am Yun-chen.

00:35:34.654 --> 00:35:35.655
Do you remember me?

00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:40.409
Come in here and talk.

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.642
Is she Hsiao-tung?

00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:31.043
Hsiao-tung.

00:37:25.181 --> 00:37:26.182
I'm sorry.

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:31.062
I wasn't there for you back then.

00:38:11.936 --> 00:38:13.062
Fan Wei-ting,

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:14.814
you killed him, right?

00:38:24.615 --> 00:38:25.699
Which kill was Jung-tai?

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:29.703
Third.

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:34.250
If I'm right,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.212
Chen Che-li must have been second
after he went to Hsiao-tung.

00:38:45.261 --> 00:38:46.095
Do me a favor.

00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.389
Don't call the cops.

00:38:49.682 --> 00:38:51.642
Pretend that you know nothing.

00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:56.605
After everything has been taken care of…

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:00.443
I'll turn myself in.

00:39:05.614 --> 00:39:06.449
No.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.077
I can't pretend I know nothing.

00:39:11.203 --> 00:39:12.580
Whatever you need later on,

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.916
as long as it can help you
locate those bastards,

00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:18.169
I will find a way to get it for you.

00:39:19.128 --> 00:39:20.713
Don't worry about Hsiao-tung.

00:39:21.213 --> 00:39:22.923
I'll handle everything for her.

00:39:27.178 --> 00:39:29.013
But, starting today,

00:39:29.847 --> 00:39:31.682
you can't contact Hsiao-tung in any way

00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:34.351
because I can't let anyone find out

00:39:34.852 --> 00:39:37.354
everything you're doing now
is connected to her.

00:39:39.732 --> 00:39:41.150
You know what I mean, right?

00:39:43.569 --> 00:39:44.737
Don't worry.

00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:48.073
What I'm doing now

00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:52.077
is to make everyone who might remind
Hsiao-tung of that incident

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.997
vanish from the world.

00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.670
Does that

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.756
include you?

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:41.835
Tien-ching,

00:40:42.336 --> 00:40:43.671
I am Wang.

00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.464
Do you remember me?

00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:47.758
Can you hear me?

00:41:08.195 --> 00:41:11.365
Tien-ching, it's me, Joy.

00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:13.576
I heard from Wang

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:16.495
that you'd always wished the best
for me and my wife.

00:41:18.622 --> 00:41:19.707
Thank you.

00:41:20.332 --> 00:41:23.669
My wife is a big fan of yours.

00:41:24.169 --> 00:41:26.922
We both hope that you will get better soon

00:41:27.548 --> 00:41:28.799
and return to the radio.

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:41.312
Thanks for coming today.

00:41:41.812 --> 00:41:44.189
I'll make sure to let you know
when she gets better.

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:45.983
It's nothing.

00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:48.193
If anything happens to Tien-ching,

00:41:48.277 --> 00:41:49.403
just let us know.

00:41:49.903 --> 00:41:50.988
Don't be shy.

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:54.366
She's not just a coworker to us.
She's a friend.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.452
So tell us if you need anything.

00:41:56.535 --> 00:41:57.369
Thank you.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.053
You envy her, don't you?

00:42:15.888 --> 00:42:17.056
You think she's brave.

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:19.933
She goes for what she wants

00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:21.977
and isn't afraid of judgment.

00:42:24.229 --> 00:42:26.190
You want that courage, don't you?

00:42:26.857 --> 00:42:28.651
You want to be like her, don't you?

00:42:30.486 --> 00:42:32.488
Chi-chi can help you.

00:42:36.867 --> 00:42:39.703
We're good friends, after all, aren't we?

00:42:42.122 --> 00:42:42.956
Bye.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:59.995
